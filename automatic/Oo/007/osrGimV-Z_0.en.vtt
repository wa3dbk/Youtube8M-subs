 there are special holes for 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.450
 so that the berry breathes and then we 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 collected all filled all the sieve

 useful 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:41.970
 berries as if fresh from a bush 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:47.269
 looked good sweet cherry berries large 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.670
 but nevertheless very well on her 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.750
 what good is this method of extraction of course 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 sit a toothpick for a very long time here everything 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:06.840
 fast enough like a machine gun when 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:16.439
 the reason for this is generally a very convenient song 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:19.470
 and just very fast format and i'm water 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.930
 remains the whole flesh is not damaged on 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.349

 retrieved here so neatly 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.939
 bones are extracted but all their questions 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.430
 why remove the bones the thing is 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.940
 that everyone knows that cherry cherry 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.799
 seed contains hydrocyanic acid 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 Of course, if we are talking about what we 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.680
 boiled jam or compote and he will stand 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.840
 for several months we have no 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.269
 there is no danger to man but we have 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.250
 very often and cherry compote jam 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.590
 cost by year and more here then 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.440
 already starting dangerous but in general 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.269
 remove bones unnecessary from cherries 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.129
 if you are very comfortable to 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.859

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.769
 make refueling at a filling for pies 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.479

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.129
 further generally it is very comfortable and very
