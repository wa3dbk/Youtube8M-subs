realistic feel they got lasers they got
these<00:01:09.950> flashlights<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.790> lasers<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.540> really

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
these flashlights the lasers I really

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.510 
these flashlights the lasers I really
don't<00:01:13.110> care<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> flashlights<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
don't care for in the flashlights I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.170 
don't care for in the flashlights I
think<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:16.200> too<00:01:16.350> bright<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
think are really a little too bright but

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
think are really a little too bright but
maybe<00:01:18.180> they'll<00:01:18.390> adjust<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> full

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
maybe they'll adjust them when the full

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.140 
maybe they'll adjust them when the full

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
alishan in a way but you could probably

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.130

still<00:02:28.190> fun<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> i<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:30.080> i'm<00:02:30.200> using<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
I must say there is some recoil that I'm

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.030 
I must say there is some recoil that I'm
not<00:02:43.819> used<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:44.239> more<00:02:44.629> than<00:02:44.930> any<00:02:45.319> game<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.739> I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
not used to more than any game that I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.180 
not used to more than any game that I
played<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.690> know<00:02:47.720> I'm<00:02:48.170> coming<00:02:48.440> from<00:02:48.769> call<00:02:49.160> of

duty<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:50.450> was<00:02:50.630> really<00:02:51.019> shocked<00:02:51.349> playing

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
duty and I was really shocked playing

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.559 
duty and I was really shocked playing
this<00:02:51.980> game<00:02:52.190> there's<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.579> lot<00:02:52.910> more<00:02:52.940> recoil

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
this game there's a lot more recoil

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.780 
than battlefield bad company 2 I must
say<00:02:58.129> like<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.640> m16<00:02:59.269> that's<00:02:59.599> got<00:02:59.840> some<00:02:59.989> recoil

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
say like the m16 that's got some recoil

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.460 
say like the m16 that's got some recoil
this<00:03:01.790> laser<00:03:02.209> thing<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.110> kind<00:03:03.379> of<00:03:03.410> gets

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
this laser thing that kind of gets

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.869 
this laser thing that kind of gets
annoying<00:03:03.890> that's<00:03:04.190> what<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.430> talking<00:03:04.819> about

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
annoying that's what I'm talking about

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.300 
annoying that's what I'm talking about
guys<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:06.170> gets<00:03:06.349> in<00:03:06.470> your<00:03:06.500> eyes<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.190> you're

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
guys it gets in your eyes and you're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.690 
guys it gets in your eyes and you're
like<00:03:07.459> ah<00:03:07.670> where's<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.239> guy<00:03:08.420> at<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:10.340> good

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
like ah where's the guy at and it's good

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.180 
like ah where's the guy at and it's good
but<00:03:11.239> then<00:03:11.420> it's<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.470> don't

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
but then it's you know it's I don't

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.250 
but then it's you know it's I don't
think<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.459> really<00:03:13.489> needs<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.540> shine<00:03:15.019> on

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
think it really needs to like shine on

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.470 
think it really needs to like shine on
your<00:03:15.379> eyes<00:03:15.590> like<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.459> design<00:03:16.879> is<00:03:17.180> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
your eyes like that is it design is it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.660 
your eyes like that is it design is it
designed<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.079> do<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.739> supposed<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> blind

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
designed to do that is supposed to blind

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.400 
designed to do that is supposed to blind
us<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:21.530> maybe<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.069> just<00:03:22.190> me<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.549> don't<00:03:22.880> know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
us but maybe it's just me I don't know

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.710 
us but maybe it's just me I don't know
but<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:25.250> really<00:03:25.579> challenging<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.480> figure

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
but it's really challenging to figure

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.949 
but it's really challenging to figure
out<00:03:26.870> which<00:03:27.049> pass<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.709> taken<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:29.510> know<00:03:29.660> if

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
out which pass is taken you know if

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.629 
out which pass is taken you know if
there's<00:03:30.260> only<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:30.680> map<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.220> going<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.489> make

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
there's only one map it's going to make

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.879 
there's only one map it's going to make
it<00:03:31.790> easy<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:32.660> everybody<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.380> know<00:03:33.410> where<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
it easy for everybody to know where the

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.370 
it easy for everybody to know where the
hiding<00:03:34.519> spots<00:03:34.849> are<00:03:35.120> in<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.420> map<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.049> don't

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
hiding spots are in this map so I don't

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.990 
hiding spots are in this map so I don't
think<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.709> was<00:03:36.859> really<00:03:37.190> wise<00:03:37.400> for<00:03:37.700> them<00:03:37.819> to

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
think it was really wise for them to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.300 
think it was really wise for them to
just<00:03:38.030> put<00:03:38.480> one<00:03:38.660> map<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.139> this<00:03:39.319> beta<00:03:39.590> hopefully

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
just put one map on this beta hopefully

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.879 
just put one map on this beta hopefully
they'll<00:03:40.489> put<00:03:40.760> two<00:03:40.970> maps<00:03:41.209> because<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:42.169> want<00:03:42.799> to

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
they'll put two maps because I want to

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.909 
they'll put two maps because I want to
fly<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.069> jet<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:44.019> want<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.079> fly<00:03:45.169> jet<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> don't<00:03:45.829> know

because i'm sure there's going to be

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.860 
because i'm sure there's going to be
some<00:03:54.680> big<00:03:54.950> maps<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.609> there's<00:03:56.150> no<00:03:56.329> vehicles

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
some big maps and there's no vehicles

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.620 
some big maps and there's no vehicles
that<00:03:57.049> all<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.470> this<00:03:57.620> map<00:03:57.889> I<00:03:58.269> don't<00:03:59.269> know<00:03:59.389> why<00:03:59.599> I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that all in this map I don't know why I

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.720 
that all in this map I don't know why I
mean<00:04:00.169> you<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.530> don't<00:04:00.620> need<00:04:00.950> any<00:04:01.130> vehicles

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
mean you really don't need any vehicles

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.309 
mean you really don't need any vehicles
in<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.090> map<00:04:02.329> because<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.989> pretty<00:04:03.200> small

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
in this map because it's a pretty small

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.550 
in this map because it's a pretty small
map<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:05.030> goes<00:04:05.209> pretty<00:04:05.510> far<00:04:05.900> back<00:04:06.200> actually

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
map it goes pretty far back actually

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.150 
map it goes pretty far back actually
once<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.430> get<00:04:08.000> through<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.450> area<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.950> goes

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
once you get through this area it goes

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.740 
once you get through this area it goes
in<00:04:10.340> another<00:04:10.639> part<00:04:11.120> where<00:04:11.359> there's<00:04:11.540> some

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
in another part where there's some

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.449 
in another part where there's some
buildings<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.470> stuff<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.130> can<00:04:13.340> get

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
buildings and stuff that you can get

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.379 
buildings and stuff that you can get
inside<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:15.250> lot<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.280> people<00:04:16.430> stay<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.180> back

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
inside a lot of people stay in the back

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.569 
inside a lot of people stay in the back
when<00:04:18.349> they're<00:04:18.470> defending<00:04:18.859> which<00:04:19.190> kind<00:04:19.489> of

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
when they're defending which kind of

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.209 
when they're defending which kind of
gets<00:04:19.729> annoying<00:04:20.030> because<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:21.680> can't<00:04:21.979> really

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
gets annoying because you can't really

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.290 
gets annoying because you can't really
know<00:04:22.789> flank<00:04:23.510> them<00:04:23.750> in

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
know flank them in

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.350 
know flank them in
in<00:04:24.569> this<00:04:25.009> this<00:04:26.009> area<00:04:26.460> here<00:04:26.759> it's<00:04:26.879> kind<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.150> hard

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
in this this area here it's kind of hard

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.700 
in this this area here it's kind of hard
to<00:04:27.419> flank<00:04:27.720> them<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.020> kind<00:04:28.169> of<00:04:28.259> have<00:04:28.379> to<00:04:28.440> figure

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
to flank them you kind of have to figure

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.059 
to flank them you kind of have to figure
it<00:04:28.979> out<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.419> understand<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.960> know<00:04:31.110> where<00:04:31.770> to

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069
