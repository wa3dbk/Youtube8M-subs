00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.650
 Total 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.650
 like which one i have like this 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.720
 floats 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:24.950
 unusual they have such a form 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.950
 different designs then float 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 where are you still young here this one 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.300
 I have such a running float 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:55.610
 all different buttons are of different weight 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.190
 different size but the essence of what he knows in 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.920
 what is the essence of these stand under this i 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.759
 never used it at all 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.740
 pretty massive cheap and here 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:16.070
 these coasters i used what is it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 is it an extra float for 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.180
 to shower a smaller float 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.930
 payload it pretty 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.560
 heavy and I always catch a fishing rod with 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.950
 rings and so when you use 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.760
 light package is very hard for them to throw 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.100
 and from him. 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.520
 as leskov than bad through the rings 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.430
 passes inviz and small floats but 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.700
 I understand pop rock as a little hunt 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.270
 there are up to 2 grams of well two grams too here 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 when 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.700
 the rain you catch the rain fishing rod all wet 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.380
 and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.680
 drops do not pass passes normally fishing line 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.049
 when you need to lower popova 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 gravity lacks this float for 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.160
 so that he does not go down to 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.640
 there put a hook on the hook and this one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.440
 the float rescues me very much 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.660
 At first I made such beautiful Russians 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.130
 I think so and the Russian news is big 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.049
 this float and the float plunged well 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:36.019
 That's the way to the very tip 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.450
 was above the water and everything else was 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.620
 under water the whole thing was hidden under 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.319
 water is the most important thing so that it simply does not 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.989
 drowned well and started as little as possible 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:53.900
 so as not to interfere with fishing then I already became 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.609
 do here such floats fairy tale heaven 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.030
 for all because looking at it is not 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.249
 do not need anything that he is where he is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.099
 swims 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:06.290
 badly different weight hangs on him again 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.420
 same she armed to sit in 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.420
 new clothes stuck out the very tip of the water and 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.870
 Here it turns out this tree is very heavy 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.329
 therefore she is very small 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.519
 It is heavy in itself, but this is the opposite of the stage 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.109
 he is simply the easy way and the load 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.699
 must be 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.969
 there was to be big so here here 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:32.299
 such a piece of lead is quite massive 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:40.040
 mode but I'm lucky how many I do not know them 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:42.769
 I did not hang here just while fishing so 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.590
 roughly pick a load capacity just 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.019
 noticed one more thing if big 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.680
 the float here is heavy then naturally 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.680
 will fly very far but here it is necessary 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.599
 proportions observe this float 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.000
 this float on which we catch 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.370
 for example, if you put this one here 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.069
 and float there 0 5 grams one gram 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.079
 then sometimes it gets confusing 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.659
 casting time so I never 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.250
 used on the flesh but less times 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:17.889
 on gymnastics problems with these not 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 arose never had any 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:26.570
 tangling floats it is on 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.659
 a certain length from the main ports to 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.960
 and does not interfere at all 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.409
 fuel in the water and as i say at first i 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.719
 did more or less neatly then 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.909
 became because they get lost sometimes i 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:45.680
 just got easier to do that 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:47.030
 things to be functional now 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.539
 try to draw 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.539
 about what I said this will be ours 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:06.730
 the water level here but here we have 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:12.220
 mostly pops which has a small snap 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:18.210
 hanging and kryuchochek pellets 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.210
 and here we have an additional float 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:27.610
 sticking the very tip everything else 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:33.460
 under water and fishing line 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:41.070
 a passage like this, and this one leaves 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.070
 on the tip of the rod rod with rings 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.469
 coil 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.219
 well, something like this 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.000
 this lesson is from mostly float 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.910
 at some distance hired 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.690
 distance is moving experimental 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:11.060
 by way the most important thing is that he is wrong and 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:17.900
 pulled the line behind him down now 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:26.110
 let's try to assemble this design we take 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.110
 twine slips were stake Kibrik 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.000
 we fix the float 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.610
 but 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.270
 and collect the main pop rock which 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.270
 fix bites 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.880
 to this end we cut our snap a 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:32.000
 Here we choose a certain number 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:40.130
 lengths and that's how we and 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.610
 throwing in this state watching my 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.520
 videos

 subscribe to the channel put likes to all 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.729
