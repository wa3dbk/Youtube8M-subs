to the Champions League alright so
looking<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:44.760> base<00:00:44.879> number<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.480> gonna

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
looking at base number one I'm gonna

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
looking at base number one I'm gonna
keep<00:00:45.840> using<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> hog<00:00:46.500> rider<00:00:46.710> strategy<00:00:47.190> today

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
keep using the hog rider strategy today

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.680 
keep using the hog rider strategy today
probably<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> run<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.420> tough

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
probably going to run into some tough

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.090 
probably going to run into some tough
bases<00:00:49.110> near<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> end<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> looks<00:00:49.980> like

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
bases near the end but it looks like

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
bases near the end but it looks like
this<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.430> shouldn't<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.120> bad<00:00:51.329> because

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
this one shouldn't be that bad because

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
this one shouldn't be that bad because
it<00:00:52.530> looks<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> wizard<00:00:53.399> towers<00:00:53.760> are

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it looks like the wizard towers are

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
it looks like the wizard towers are
pretty<00:00:54.180> low<00:00:54.390> leveled<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> whenever<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.379> see

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pretty low leveled and whenever you see

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.720 
pretty low leveled and whenever you see
wizard<00:00:55.860> towers<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> are<00:00:56.370> pretty<00:00:56.550> low

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
wizard towers that are pretty low

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
wizard towers that are pretty low
leveled<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.210> well<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.559> inside<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
leveled as well as like inside of the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
leveled as well as like inside of the
base<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.850> any<00:01:00.030> 2x2<00:01:00.480> squares<00:01:01.020> where

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
base I don't see any 2x2 squares where

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
base I don't see any 2x2 squares where
the<00:01:01.410> giant<00:01:01.739> bombs<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the giant bombs could be so at this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
the giant bombs could be so at this
point<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.960> pretty<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> go

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
point I think I'm pretty much good to go

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
point I think I'm pretty much good to go
I<00:01:04.979> don't<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.909> many<00:01:06.090> spells<00:01:06.390> I'm

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I don't really know how many spells I'm

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.500 
I don't really know how many spells I'm
gonna<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> drop<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.950> guess<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.850> could<00:01:09.299> drop

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
gonna have to drop I guess I could drop

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
gonna have to drop I guess I could drop
all<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.170> wanted<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.010> I'm

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
all of them if I wanted to but if I'm

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.830 
all of them if I wanted to but if I'm
trying<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> save<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.060> could<00:01:12.420> probably<00:01:12.600> only

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
trying to save I could probably only

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420 
trying to save I could probably only
drop<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> still<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.890> three<00:01:14.070> stars<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
drop two and still get three stars in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
drop two and still get three stars in
the<00:01:14.490> space<00:01:15.020> all<00:01:16.020> right<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.439> we're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the space all right so right now we're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
the space all right so right now we're
at<00:01:16.680> 38%<00:01:17.250> looks<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.909> we're<00:01:18.060> doing<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> great

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
at 38% looks like we're doing a great

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030 
at 38% looks like we're doing a great
job<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.750> hogs<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.140> already<00:01:19.380> taken<00:01:19.680> care<00:01:19.860> of

for a townhall 9 because I'm really only

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.859 
for a townhall 9 because I'm really only
finding<00:01:40.890> Town<00:01:41.100> Hall<00:01:41.280> tens<00:01:41.869> unfortunately

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
finding Town Hall tens unfortunately

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
finding Town Hall tens unfortunately
just<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.470> quest<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> top<00:01:44.070> 200<00:01:44.280> I'm

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
just like my quest at the top 200 I'm

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.310 
just like my quest at the top 200 I'm
actually<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> search<00:01:46.110> for

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
actually going to have to search for

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
actually going to have to search for
bases<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.829> instead<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.790> finding<00:01:48.119> base

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bases now instead of just finding base

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
bases now instead of just finding base
after<00:01:48.780> base<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> attack<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> spend

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
after base to attack I do have to spend

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609 
after base to attack I do have to spend
like<00:01:51.000> 3<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.360> 4<00:01:51.540> minutes<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.990> find<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.290> base<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like 3 or 4 minutes to find a base to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.200 
like 3 or 4 minutes to find a base to
attack<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.100> hog<00:01:53.280> rider<00:01:53.490> strategy<00:01:53.939> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
attack with the hog rider strategy so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.760 
attack with the hog rider strategy so
that<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.780> actually<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.170> good<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.619> for

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that was actually a pretty good one for

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.069 
that was actually a pretty good one for
having<00:01:56.040> 24<00:01:56.399> trophies

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
having 24 trophies

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.359 
having 24 trophies
so<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.259> base<00:01:58.380> number<00:01:58.409> 2<00:01:58.799> looks<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.219> we're

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so for base number 2 looks like we're

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.149 
so for base number 2 looks like we're
attacking<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.909> guy<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> Crystal<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.840> only<00:02:01.500> 17

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
attacking a guy in Crystal one only 17

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.620 
attacking a guy in Crystal one only 17
trophies<00:02:02.490> available<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.060> guess<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.509> not

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
trophies available I guess that's not

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
trophies available I guess that's not
bad<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.590> take<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> especially

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
bad and we can take that especially

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
bad and we can take that especially
since<00:02:05.729> he's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> townhall<00:02:06.329> 9<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.840> looking<00:02:07.770> at

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
since he's a townhall 9 and looking at

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.499 
since he's a townhall 9 and looking at
his<00:02:07.979> clan<00:02:08.250> castle<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.030> something<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
his clan castle this is something that a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.820 
his clan castle this is something that a
lot<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:09.959> struggle<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.319> getting<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
lot of people struggle with getting the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.170 
lot of people struggle with getting the
clan<00:02:11.009> castles<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.580> are<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> center<00:02:12.030> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
clan castles that are in the center of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.370 
clan castles that are in the center of
the<00:02:12.239> base<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.170> thought

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the base and I thought

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.780 
the base and I thought
I<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.590> gonna<00:02:13.680> drop<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> hog<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.610> hop

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I was gonna drop a hog that would hop

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.160 
I was gonna drop a hog that would hop
over<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> wall<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.600> touch<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.990> Whizzer

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
over the wall and touch the Whizzer

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.360 
over the wall and touch the Whizzer
tower<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.830> looks<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.280> was

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
tower but it looks like there was

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.400 
tower but it looks like there was
actually<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> Tesla<00:02:18.240> right<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.290> was

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
actually a Tesla right here and I was

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.020 
actually a Tesla right here and I was
surprised<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.950> my<00:02:20.130> hog<00:02:20.370> could<00:02:20.670> reach<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
surprised that my hog could reach the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.640 
surprised that my hog could reach the
clan<00:02:21.210> castle<00:02:21.450> radius<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.350> pretty<00:02:22.530> lucky

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
clan castle radius so I got pretty lucky

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.010 
clan castle radius so I got pretty lucky
here<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> at<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.270> point<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.690> were<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
here and at this point there were so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.630 
here and at this point there were so
many<00:02:25.140> clan<00:02:25.470> castle<00:02:25.830> troops<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.250> sort<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
many clan castle troops like sort of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
like distracting my hog riders that I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.380 
like distracting my hog riders that I
decided<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.220> drop<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.700> more<00:02:29.730> barian<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.300> the

bottom<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.960> clear<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.200> some<00:02:31.410> space<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
bottom just to clear up some space and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.740 
bottom just to clear up some space and
then<00:02:32.550> after<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.970> dropped<00:02:33.270> my<00:02:33.330> hog<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
them in two separate spots and hopefully

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.840

they'll<00:03:30.960> start<00:03:31.080> taking<00:03:31.440> over<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> base<00:03:31.850> so

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
they'll start taking over the base so

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.730 
they'll start taking over the base so
priorities<00:03:33.450> right<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.960> dropping<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.470> I

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
priorities right now is dropping my I

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.990 
priorities right now is dropping my I
think<00:03:34.830> I'm<00:03:35.040> going<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.190> drop<00:03:35.340> my<00:03:35.490> heal<00:03:35.700> spells

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
think I'm going to drop my heal spells

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.340 
think I'm going to drop my heal spells
when<00:03:36.210> they<00:03:36.300> get<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.660> wizard<00:03:36.870> tower<00:03:37.140> right

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
when they get to this wizard tower right

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.260 
when they get to this wizard tower right
here<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.740> like<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.400> said<00:03:38.460> in<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> strategy

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
here and like I said in the strategy

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.970 
here and like I said in the strategy
video<00:03:39.570> dropping<00:03:40.110> them<00:03:40.350> under<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.710> wizard

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
video dropping them under the wizard

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.949 
video dropping them under the wizard
tower<00:03:41.160> seems<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.910> pretty<00:03:42.209> prime<00:03:42.600> place

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
tower seems to be a pretty prime place

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.380 
tower seems to be a pretty prime place
because<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.100> wizard<00:03:44.400> towers<00:03:44.760> beside<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
because the wizard towers beside the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.000 
because the wizard towers beside the
giant<00:03:45.750> bombs<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.110> course<00:03:46.320> seem<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.770> be<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
giant bombs of course seem to be the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.920 
giant bombs of course seem to be the
number<00:03:47.250> one<00:03:47.370> enemy<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.330> guess<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.600> inferno

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
number one enemy and I guess the inferno

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
number one enemy and I guess the inferno
towers<00:03:49.080> too<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.560> I'm<00:03:49.650> talking<00:03:49.890> about

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
towers too but I'm talking about

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.650 
towers too but I'm talking about
townhall<00:03:50.400> 9<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.850> townhall<00:03:51.240> nines<00:03:51.420> it's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
townhall 9 with townhall nines it's

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060 
townhall 9 with townhall nines it's
really<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.050> giant<00:03:52.380> bombs<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.800> wizard

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
really the giant bombs and the wizard

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.920 
really the giant bombs and the wizard
towers<00:03:53.400> especially<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.390> wizard<00:03:54.660> towers

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
towers especially if the wizard towers

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.410 
towers especially if the wizard towers
are<00:03:55.080> well<00:03:55.260> upgraded<00:03:55.770> like<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.070> guys<00:03:56.220> are<00:03:56.420> so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
are well upgraded like this guys are so

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.030 
are well upgraded like this guys are so
whenever<00:03:57.900> they<00:03:58.110> get<00:03:58.230> under<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.709> I'm<00:03:58.890> just

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
whenever they get under that I'm just

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.470 
whenever they get under that I'm just
going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> drop<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> heal<00:03:59.580> spell<00:03:59.640> try<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.150> get<00:04:00.450> a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
going to drop a heal spell try to get a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.120 
going to drop a heal spell try to get a
couple<00:04:00.630> other<00:04:00.900> defenses<00:04:01.410> inside<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.920> heal

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
couple other defenses inside of the heal

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.550 
couple other defenses inside of the heal
radius<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:03.390> after<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.110> should<00:04:04.170> be

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
radius and then after that we should be

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.710 
radius and then after that we should be
fine<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.250> only<00:04:05.550> have<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.150> heal<00:04:06.300> spell<00:04:06.540> left

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
fine I only have one heal spell left

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.150 
fine I only have one heal spell left
probably<00:04:07.020> don't<00:04:07.170> have<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.380> drop<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.980> let

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
probably don't have to drop that and let

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.350 
probably don't have to drop that and let
me<00:04:08.190> go<00:04:08.340> ahead<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.490> fast<00:04:08.700> forward<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.120> wrap<00:04:09.209> up

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
me go ahead and fast forward and wrap up

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.390 
me go ahead and fast forward and wrap up
this<00:04:09.450> raid<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:10.890> looks<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.280> was

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
this raid so it looks like this was

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.040 
this raid so it looks like this was
another<00:04:11.640> pretty<00:04:11.820> solid<00:04:12.150> raid<00:04:12.270> 17<00:04:12.720> trophies

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
another pretty solid raid 17 trophies

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.960 
another pretty solid raid 17 trophies
available<00:04:13.470> make<00:04:13.980> sure<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.370> stole<00:04:14.700> all<00:04:14.730> of

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
available make sure we stole all of

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.210 
available make sure we stole all of
those<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.570> from<00:04:15.959> here<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.530> probably<00:04:17.010> going

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
those and from here I'm probably going

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.830 
those and from here I'm probably going
to<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.580> start<00:04:17.790> tacking<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.420> Town<00:04:18.630> Hall

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
to have to start tacking some Town Hall

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.710 
to have to start tacking some Town Hall
tens<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.980> if<00:04:20.220> we<00:04:20.430> look<00:04:20.640> at<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:20.940> next<00:04:21.330> raid

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
tens so if we look at this next raid

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.540 
tens so if we look at this next raid
this<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.229> was<00:04:22.410> definitely<00:04:22.650> sketchy<00:04:23.250> looking

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
this one was definitely sketchy looking

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.820 
this one was definitely sketchy looking
at<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:23.910> guy's<00:04:24.090> base<00:04:24.419> he<00:04:25.050> hasn't<00:04:25.410> almost

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
at this guy's base he hasn't almost

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.540 
at this guy's base he hasn't almost
maxed<00:04:26.250> out

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
maxed out

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.189 
maxed out
ace<00:04:26.669> are<00:04:27.030> actually<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.750> think<00:04:27.930> he<00:04:28.020> does

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
ace are actually I think he does

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.990 
ace are actually I think he does
actually<00:04:28.409> have<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> maxout<00:04:29.129> base<00:04:29.340> besides<00:04:29.759> his

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
actually have a maxout base besides his

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.379 
actually have a maxout base besides his
walls<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:30.979> besides<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.129> fact<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.490> his<00:04:32.789> his

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
walls so besides the fact that his his

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.779 
walls so besides the fact that his his
base<00:04:34.319> really<00:04:34.800> doesn't<00:04:35.069> look<00:04:35.159> that<00:04:35.220> good<00:04:35.550> as

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
base really doesn't look that good as

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.339 
base really doesn't look that good as
well<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.300> he<00:04:36.389> doesn't<00:04:36.629> have<00:04:36.720> any<00:04:36.810> clan<00:04:37.020> castle

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
well as he doesn't have any clan castle

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.899 
well as he doesn't have any clan castle
troops<00:04:37.560> he<00:04:37.710> does<00:04:37.889> have<00:04:38.069> level<00:04:38.340> forty<00:04:38.610> Heroes

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
troops he does have level forty Heroes

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.580 
troops he does have level forty Heroes
and<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.150> think<00:04:39.419> all<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.780> defenses<00:04:40.199> are<00:04:40.229> maxed

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
and I think all the defenses are maxed

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.710 
and I think all the defenses are maxed
out<00:04:40.710> from<00:04:40.889> what<00:04:41.009> I've<00:04:41.099> seen<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:42.270> because<00:04:42.599> this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
out from what I've seen so because this

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.330 
out from what I've seen so because this
guy<00:04:42.900> has<00:04:43.080> level<00:04:43.319> forty<00:04:43.560> heroes<00:04:43.830> I'm<00:04:44.039> probably

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
guy has level forty heroes I'm probably

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.010 
guy has level forty heroes I'm probably
gonna<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.879> improvise<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.360> little<00:04:45.569> bit<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
gonna have to improvise a little bit and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.170 
gonna have to improvise a little bit and
see<00:04:46.680> if<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.009> can<00:04:47.220> take<00:04:47.370> care<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.819> them<00:04:47.970> because

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
see if I can take care of them because

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.969 
see if I can take care of them because
it's<00:04:48.509> pretty<00:04:48.780> tough<00:04:49.020> having<00:04:49.409> only<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.740> couple

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
it's pretty tough having only a couple

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.040 
it's pretty tough having only a couple
of<00:04:50.159> wizards<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.610> clan<00:04:50.849> castle<00:04:51.050> usually

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
of wizards in the clan castle usually

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.869 
of wizards in the clan castle usually
I'm<00:04:52.169> going<00:04:52.680> against<00:04:53.009> like<00:04:53.129> level<00:04:53.400> ten<00:04:53.580> heroes

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
I'm going against like level ten heroes

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.330 
I'm going against like level ten heroes
again<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.960> only<00:04:55.349> reason<00:04:55.680> I'm<00:04:55.770> attacking<00:04:56.069> this

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
again the only reason I'm attacking this

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.129 
again the only reason I'm attacking this
base<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.729> because<00:04:56.879> he<00:04:57.150> has<00:04:57.270> single<00:04:57.659> targeted

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
base is because he has single targeted

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.140 
base is because he has single targeted
Inferno<00:04:58.530> towers<00:04:58.949> if<00:04:59.099> he<00:04:59.219> had<00:04:59.370> multi<00:04:59.699> targeted

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
Inferno towers if he had multi targeted

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.029 
Inferno towers if he had multi targeted
Inferno<00:05:00.479> towers<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.080> definitely<00:05:01.770> would<00:05:01.889> not

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
Inferno towers I definitely would not

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.249 
Inferno towers I definitely would not
touch<00:05:02.219> a<00:05:02.280> maxed<00:05:02.669> out<00:05:02.789> base<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:03.599> was<00:05:04.080> really

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
touch a maxed out base but I was really

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.600 
touch a maxed out base but I was really
struggling<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.770> find<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.099> good<00:05:05.190> base<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.370> at

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
struggling to find a good base and at

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.680 
struggling to find a good base and at
this<00:05:05.759> point<00:05:05.969> I<00:05:06.060> was<00:05:06.180> definitely<00:05:06.360> down<00:05:06.629> to

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
this point I was definitely down to

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.749 
this point I was definitely down to
attack<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.229> guy<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.310> looks<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.669> did

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
attack this guy so it looks like we did

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.129 
attack this guy so it looks like we did
a<00:05:08.819> great<00:05:09.120> job<00:05:09.360> in<00:05:09.479> taking<00:05:09.780> care<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.960> those

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
a great job in taking care of those

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.080 
a great job in taking care of those
heroes<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.740> at<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.099> point<00:05:11.340> it's<00:05:11.580> time<00:05:11.849> to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
heroes and at this point it's time to

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.180 
heroes and at this point it's time to
drop<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.449> Hogs<00:05:12.719> so<00:05:13.469> I'm<00:05:13.650> gonna<00:05:13.800> go<00:05:13.919> in<00:05:14.039> through

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
looks like there's a couple of Defense's

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.830 
looks like there's a couple of Defense's
left<00:05:48.599> on<00:05:48.779> the<00:05:48.960> top<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:50.699> it<00:05:51.300> looks<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.630> most

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
left on the top and it looks like most

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.450 
left on the top and it looks like most
of<00:05:51.960> my<00:05:52.020> hogs<00:05:52.349> are<00:05:52.560> left<00:05:52.740> on<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.949> top<00:05:53.159> so<00:05:53.370> I'm

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
of my hogs are left on the top so I'm

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.920 
of my hogs are left on the top so I'm
just<00:05:53.580> gonna<00:05:53.669> have<00:05:53.909> to<00:05:53.969> focus<00:05:54.360> on<00:05:54.509> those<00:05:54.719> guys

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
just gonna have to focus on those guys

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.360 
just gonna have to focus on those guys
and<00:05:55.169> see<00:05:55.349> if<00:05:55.409> they<00:05:55.529> can<00:05:55.650> take<00:05:55.830> down<00:05:56.159> the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
and see if they can take down the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.700 
and see if they can take down the
remaining<00:05:56.759> stuff<00:05:56.969> really<00:05:57.690> I'm<00:05:57.990> only<00:05:58.259> worried

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
remaining stuff really I'm only worried

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.170 
remaining stuff really I'm only worried
about<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:59.039> wizard<00:05:59.370> tower<00:05:59.520> because<00:05:59.909> it<00:06:00.029> does

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
about this wizard tower because it does

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.820 
about this wizard tower because it does
damage<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.629> multiple<00:06:00.719> targets<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:01.440> I'm<00:06:01.529> hoping

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
damage to multiple targets so I'm hoping

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.529 
damage to multiple targets so I'm hoping
they<00:06:01.979> take<00:06:02.159> that<00:06:02.340> down<00:06:02.490> as<00:06:02.669> fast<00:06:02.940> as<00:06:03.090> possible

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
they take that down as fast as possible

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.390 
they take that down as fast as possible
and<00:06:03.690> now<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.650> that's<00:06:04.800> down<00:06:05.009> there's<00:06:05.219> only

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
and now that that's down there's only

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.129 
and now that that's down there's only
three<00:06:05.699> things<00:06:05.879> left<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.270> inferno<00:06:06.599> tower<00:06:06.840> the

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
three things left the inferno tower the

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.779 
three things left the inferno tower the
archer<00:06:07.469> tower<00:06:07.650> in<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.949> cannon<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:08.610> the

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
archer tower in the cannon so the

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.640 
archer tower in the cannon so the
inferno<00:06:09.120> towers<00:06:09.330> do<00:06:09.719> have<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:09.930> ton<00:06:10.349> of<00:06:10.379> health

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
inferno towers do have a ton of health

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.409 
inferno towers do have a ton of health
so<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.490> took<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.639> while<00:06:11.789> to<00:06:11.849> get<00:06:12.029> that<00:06:12.180> thing

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
so it took a while to get that thing

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.480 
so it took a while to get that thing
down<00:06:12.599> and<00:06:12.810> then<00:06:13.110> finally<00:06:13.710> my<00:06:13.830> hog<00:06:14.039> riders<00:06:14.340> will

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
down and then finally my hog riders will

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.610 
down and then finally my hog riders will
hop<00:06:14.699> over<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.870> looks<00:06:16.080> like<00:06:16.169> they<00:06:16.469> will

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
hop over and it looks like they will

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.439 
hop over and it looks like they will
have<00:06:16.830> just<00:06:16.860> enough<00:06:17.490> health<00:06:17.729> to<00:06:17.819> take<00:06:17.969> care<00:06:18.419> of

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
have just enough health to take care of

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.209 
have just enough health to take care of
this<00:06:18.599> Archer<00:06:18.990> tower<00:06:19.169> and<00:06:19.500> take<00:06:19.650> care<00:06:19.919> of<00:06:20.069> this

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
this Archer tower and take care of this

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.790 
this Archer tower and take care of this
cannon<00:06:20.690> so<00:06:21.690> that<00:06:21.870> was<00:06:22.020> definitely<00:06:22.199> too<00:06:22.560> close

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
cannon so that was definitely too close

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.649 
cannon so that was definitely too close
for<00:06:23.009> comfort<00:06:23.069> again<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:23.969> definitely<00:06:24.300> do<00:06:24.629> not

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
for comfort again I definitely do not

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.290 
for comfort again I definitely do not
recommend<00:06:25.440> attack<00:06:25.860> attacking<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.789> maxed<00:06:27.180> out

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
recommend attack attacking a maxed out

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.089 
recommend attack attacking a maxed out
base<00:06:27.539> with<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.960> hog<00:06:28.110> rider<00:06:28.319> strategy<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.830> said

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
base with the hog rider strategy I said

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.430 
base with the hog rider strategy I said
that<00:06:29.250> in<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:29.430> last<00:06:29.580> video<00:06:29.779> but<00:06:30.779> since<00:06:31.199> this

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
that in the last video but since this

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.869 
that in the last video but since this
gate<00:06:31.590> guy<00:06:31.830> did<00:06:32.039> have<00:06:32.190> single<00:06:32.520> targeted

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
gate guy did have single targeted

or<00:06:42.510> three<00:06:42.660> hogs<00:06:43.050> left<00:06:43.350> so<00:06:44.310> instead<00:06:44.820> of<00:06:44.940> wasting

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
or three hogs left so instead of wasting

or three hogs left so instead of wasting
time<00:06:45.480> I<00:06:45.540> can<00:06:45.780> probably<00:06:46.050> just<00:06:46.230> go<00:06:46.320> ahead<00:06:46.440> and

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590
