 continue to store updates 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 locally the w.bush server requires

 at least six gigabytes of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.350
 free disk space the actual amount 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.780

 using http and https 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.140
 languages to minimize the use of space 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.420
 on disk you must choose to
