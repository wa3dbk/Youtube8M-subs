I'm using flexitime putty by her a Asst
and<00:00:08.940> you'll<00:00:09.389> notice<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.929> getting<00:00:10.260> out<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
and you'll notice that I'm getting out a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
and you'll notice that I'm getting out a
very<00:00:11.010> level<00:00:11.490> scoop<00:00:11.849> want<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.300> make<00:00:12.420> sure<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
very level scoop want to make sure that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.780 
very level scoop want to make sure that
as<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.710> doing<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.370> use<00:00:14.549> even

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
as we're doing this that we use even

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.060 
as we're doing this that we use even
amounts<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.450> base<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> catalyst<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
amounts of base and catalyst as the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
amounts of base and catalyst as the
materials<00:00:17.730> handling<00:00:18.090> properties<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.050> set

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
materials handling properties and set

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
materials handling properties and set
time<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.859> dependent<00:00:20.460> upon<00:00:20.789> having<00:00:21.359> these

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
time are all dependent upon having these

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
time are all dependent upon having these
equal<00:00:21.960> quantities<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> scoops

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
equal quantities so I'm using the scoops

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.450 
equal quantities so I'm using the scoops
provided<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:24.810> sure<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.310> once<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
provided to make sure I do that once I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.950 
provided to make sure I do that once I
get<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> level<00:00:27.090> scoop<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.840> actually

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
get the level scoop I'm gonna actually

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
get the level scoop I'm gonna actually
put<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.830> hand<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.609> I'm

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
put it out into my hand and then I'm

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
put it out into my hand and then I'm
gonna<00:00:29.789> mix<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.750> palm<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.349> we'll<00:00:31.529> go

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
gonna mix it in my palm and we'll go

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.940 
gonna mix it in my palm and we'll go
through<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> mixing<00:00:32.790> protocol<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.829> like<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
through that mixing protocol I like the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
through that mixing protocol I like the
flexitime<00:00:35.489> putty<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> putty<00:00:36.840> putty

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
flexitime putty as it's a putty putty

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130 
flexitime putty as it's a putty putty
system<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.059> flexibility<00:00:39.750> even

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
system and it has some flexibility even

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990 
system and it has some flexibility even
after<00:00:40.440> cured<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.100> makes<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> perfect<00:00:41.940> for

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
after cured which makes it perfect for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
after cured which makes it perfect for
reduction<00:00:42.600> matrix

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
reduction matrix

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
reduction matrix
you'll<00:00:43.800> notice<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.399> mixing<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> palm<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you'll notice I'm mixing in the palm of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
you'll notice I'm mixing in the palm of
my<00:00:45.360> hand<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.899> kneading<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.800> thumb<00:00:47.100> from

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
my hand and kneading with my thumb from

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
my hand and kneading with my thumb from
my<00:00:47.430> other<00:00:47.579> hand<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.780> looking<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
my other hand what I'm looking for is to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.889 
my other hand what I'm looking for is to
make<00:00:49.710> sure<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.969> gray<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> purple

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
make sure that the gray and the purple

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
make sure that the gray and the purple
colors<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.500> being<00:00:52.680> evenly<00:00:53.430> incorporated<00:00:53.690> so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
colors are being evenly incorporated so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
colors are being evenly incorporated so
that<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.079> done<00:00:55.110> mixing<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.100> one

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that when I'm done mixing I have one

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
that when I'm done mixing I have one
uniform<00:00:57.090> color<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.809> no<00:00:57.870> longer<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.379> any

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
uniform color and I no longer have any

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
uniform color and I no longer have any
streaks<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.160> grey<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> purple<00:01:00.199> once<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.350> get

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
streaks of grey and purple once I get

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
streaks of grey and purple once I get
the<00:01:01.620> material<00:01:01.739> completely<00:01:02.730> incorporated<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the material completely incorporated and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
the material completely incorporated and
I<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> uniform<00:01:05.010> color<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I do have a uniform color I'll then be

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
I do have a uniform color I'll then be
able<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> form<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.200> material<00:01:07.770> over<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
able to form the material over the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
able to form the material over the
dental<00:01:08.580> cast<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> front<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.780> me

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
dental cast that I have in front of me

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080 
dental cast that I have in front of me
so<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> first<00:01:11.040> rolled<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> ball<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so I first rolled it into a ball and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
so I first rolled it into a ball and
then<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:13.049> roll<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
then I actually roll it out into a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
then I actually roll it out into a
hotdog<00:01:14.310> shape<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.140> lay<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
hotdog shape so now I can just lay it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
hotdog shape so now I can just lay it
into<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> arch<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> dental

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
into you over the arch of the dental

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
into you over the arch of the dental
cast<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.560> begin<00:01:19.950> forming<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.420> I'm

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
cast and then begin forming it what I'm

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
cast and then begin forming it what I'm
trying<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:22.770> trying<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
into a shape that's comfortable to go

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
into a shape that's comfortable to go
into<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> patient's<00:01:40.409> mouth<00:01:40.470> easy<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.369> get

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
into the patient's mouth easy to get

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
into the patient's mouth easy to get
underneath<00:01:41.820> their<00:01:42.180> lips<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.290> gonna<00:01:43.409> take

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
underneath their lips so I'm gonna take

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
underneath their lips so I'm gonna take
time<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.460> sure<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> form<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
time to make sure I form it on the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410 
time to make sure I form it on the
buckle<00:01:46.020> specifically<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> also<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> make

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
buckle specifically and also that I make

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.630 
buckle specifically and also that I make
it<00:01:48.540> easy<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.140> me<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.710> assistant<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> work

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it easy for me or my assistant to work

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
it easy for me or my assistant to work
well<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> want<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:51.930> sure<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.259> have

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
well so I want to make sure that I have

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
well so I want to make sure that I have
a<00:01:52.439> very<00:01:52.890> flat<00:01:53.280> surface<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> occlusal

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
a very flat surface on the occlusal

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.109 
a very flat surface on the occlusal
tables<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.189> making<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.759> for

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
tables so if I'm making this for

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
tables so if I'm making this for
provisional<00:01:58.110> matrix<00:01:58.259> let's<00:01:58.770> say<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.520> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
provisional matrix let's say that then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
provisional matrix let's say that then
when<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> seed<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> basic<00:02:01.110> rollin<00:02:01.469> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
when I seed it with the basic rollin I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
when I seed it with the basic rollin I
have<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.009> flat<00:02:02.399> surface<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
have this flat surface so that I can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
have this flat surface so that I can
evenly<00:02:04.350> apply<00:02:04.829> pressure<00:02:05.159> against<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> teeth

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
evenly apply pressure against the teeth

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.809 
evenly apply pressure against the teeth
when<00:02:06.420> I'm<00:02:06.540> holding<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> mouth<00:02:07.819> making

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
when I'm holding it in the mouth making

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.029 
when I'm holding it in the mouth making
sure<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> labial<00:02:09.899> surface<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.530> flat<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
sure that the labial surface is flat and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.010 
sure that the labial surface is flat and
smooth<00:02:11.340> makes<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.060> more<00:02:12.209> comfortable<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
smooth makes it more comfortable for the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
smooth makes it more comfortable for the
patient<00:02:13.470> as
