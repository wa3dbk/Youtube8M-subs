 I don't know why 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.129

 that good and specter are the only TVs 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.479
 what super effective sleep between them 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.560
 against between icon it seems to me you know fuocobomba though 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.930
 I should be faster 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.029

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.930

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.469
 against salamence remains elite 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.589

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.009
 use full charge but 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.009
 last song sends him to the head 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.650

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.879

 that is these instruments that I am using - the gym of fiammetta 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.710

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.960

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.789
