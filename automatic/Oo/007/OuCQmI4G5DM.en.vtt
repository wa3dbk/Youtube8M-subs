that another down point though is that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.660 
that another down point though is that
it<00:03:37.709> doesn't<00:03:38.070> work<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.459> max<00:03:39.080> which<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:41.310> good<00:03:41.550> to

it doesn't work for max which is good to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.220 
it doesn't work for max which is good to
know<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.910> you've<00:03:42.030> got<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> mac<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.810> do<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.080> good

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
buying it if you've got a mac it will

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.680 
buying it if you've got a mac it will
work<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.070> wired<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.030> some<00:03:48.390> people

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
work and it is wired so some people

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.570 
work and it is wired so some people
would<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.260> either<00:03:49.440> I'm<00:03:50.220> sure<00:03:50.459> they

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
would like that either I'm sure they

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.940 
would like that either I'm sure they
might<00:03:50.760> bring<00:03:50.940> out<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.360> that's<00:03:51.600> not<00:03:51.810> wired<00:03:52.080> so

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
might bring out one that's not wired so

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.310 
might bring out one that's not wired so
really<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> depends<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.060> how<00:03:54.870> much<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.170> want

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
really it depends on how much you want

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.850 
really it depends on how much you want
to<00:03:55.350> spend<00:03:55.670> whether<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.850> like<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> wired<00:03:57.420> mouse

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
to spend whether you like a wired mouse

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.060 
to spend whether you like a wired mouse
and<00:03:58.860> if<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.489> mac<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.709> need<00:04:01.860> that
