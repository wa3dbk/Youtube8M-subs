 Welcome! This will just be a product review and I've done this already 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.500
 Video in Mani tail review products back in summer time when you 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310
 I first started using the entire product line; I thought it was amazing and 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.300
 I decided to do a product review like two weeks after I used it 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 I had already stopped using it and started - and finally found my basic products 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.860
 My products go to. I was actually watching one of my videos - Monstat 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 Video to challenge my MN - I was looking at the length of my hair when I was 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.130
 [My hair] brought forward everything was so ... 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.660
 For past videos, I've been talking about my hair and it was 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.610
 Really UNEVEN. I talked about Hairlista and two haircare forums 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.820
 That my hair grows upside down in the form of a U. hairy 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.210
 In fact, these two sides come here; the rest of my poetry comes 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.110
 Around here, so it is about two inches difference with my hair in the back. And 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.500
 It's literally like upside down U. For the month of June and July, I did not use any 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.150
 Growth aid at all. The only thing I was using was Mani Tail and I 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 He started thinking "Well it must be! This must be the reason for my hair, everything 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.860
 Suddenly, it grows in two different stages now! "I have shampoo and 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 A conditioner, I actually got these in Walgreens for $ 3.99 for this gigantic 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.790
 bottle. They had a steady sale. This is consistency, so it is very good 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.640
 It's not very sticky, it's not too bad. Kind of looks weird like this. This kind of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430
 Looks like liquid soap, in fact. The conditioner has a bit of a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.890
 The yellow side, but it is still the same consistency. It's a small think - 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.440
 Small adhesive it's not aqueous. This was literally just a shampoo 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.170
 Conditioner and two other products I was using from [they]. Even more than 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 Summer, that was ... literally just a wash, air conditioning with this for 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.159
 Two months in a row, it was. And it grows your hair. But anyway 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.790
 Cause me, did not grow everything on my head, so just grew on 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.739
 Outside and not the middle of my hair. The main thing was just to talk about shampoo 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.510
 And conditioner, because it made a big difference with my hair. And 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.720
 I hope to admit it early instead of - you know, like six months later!
