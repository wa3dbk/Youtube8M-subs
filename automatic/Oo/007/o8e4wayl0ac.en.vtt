 and so healthy diet and supplements 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.149
 supplement standard healthy 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.289
 ration you need to understand what is in front of you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 there are tasks 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.590
 this may be the first set of mass the second 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 fat burning ie drying and third 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 maintaining the form immediately want to say that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.370
 further I will tell only about the basics of healthy 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740
 nutrition the body of any person 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.720
 so individual that not everything is possible 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 reduce to the general rule when building 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.820
 diets take into account many factors type 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.159
 physique your level of metabolism 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 your daily load and your image 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 life but give some kind of common 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 recommendations for healthy eating yet 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.659
 you can and I will tell you about them now 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 let's go in order 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.460
 if your task is to gain mass then the first 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
 what needs to be done is to increase 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 protein and carbohydrate consumption 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.090
 the amount of protein should be somewhere around 2 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.619
 grams per 1 kilogram of body weight 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.299
 carbohydrate should be in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.579
 one and a half two times more than in the diet 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.219
 ordinary man all these increased 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.009
 the quantity needs to be distributed to 68 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.340
 meals yes my friends will have to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.280
 many and often it is the inevitable sacrifice 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.979
 weight gain and so to the usual 3 one-time 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.799
 nutrition add two three meals 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.600
 as a protein shake or a gainer 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.789
 In case of the latter, you will receive and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.619
 extra protein and carbohydrates in 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.320
 one product who did not look at me 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880
 there are rollers for protein and gainer 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.490
 I recommend to watch them also 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.900
 add one meal consisting of 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.960
 two protein bars 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.550
 and fruit pairs again you get and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.010
 protein and carbohydrates 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.480
 instead of cocktails and bars you can also 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.040
 use special media 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.170
 and which are called substitutes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.840
 power down balanced all needed 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.180
 substances and they are absorbed much better 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.760
 than solid and yes but just assimilation on 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.129
 Initially it may be a problem 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.950
 so change cocktails or nutrition 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.720
 may serve you well while 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.180
 the body will not get used to recycle 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.760
 large amounts of food help the body with 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.040
 assimilation is also possible with the help of enzymes 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.650
 these are substances that are produced in 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.530
 our body naturally they 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.230
 we need to digest food but if 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 it may take a lot of food 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.890
 additional portion of enzymes 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.140
 additives can use them to avoid 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.799
 such troubles as bloating and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.750
 diarrhea 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.819
 which at first often 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.620
 attend athletes diet also 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 It is recommended to supplement with vitamins and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.239
 minerals these substances are active 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.609
 consumed under load and therefore their 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.620
 stocks it is desirable to replenish more than that 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.109
 as practice shows many famous 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.000
 bodybuilders in power sports without 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.950
 good vitamin-mineral complexes 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.660
 it is simply impossible to achieve results 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.239
 if you recommend any specific 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.000
 options that I personally like animal 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.799
 pak from universal nutrition opti-men 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.989
 and opium for men and women 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.639
 respectively manufacturer company 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.590
 optimum nutrition and this complex 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.489
 the de facto formula from ultimate 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.680
 nutrition 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.019
 these complexes need to take courses 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.590
 one to two months of admission and one month 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.590
 break 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.349
 Now let's see what to do with 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.780
 standard healthy diet if worth 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.910
 the task of getting rid of excess fat as 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.720
 the famous russian ballet dancer maya spoke 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.330
 plisetskaya 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.310
 the secret of slim figure does not eat anything 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.620
 but this method leads not only to 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.810
 reduce fat but also to disappear 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.349
 muscle mass and this is our categorically 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.750
 not suitable so if you need to remove 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.940
 fat but still maintain muscle and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.180
 be valid for employment in the hall 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.370
 the basic rule is a fractional 5-6 one-time 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.290
 food in small portions while 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.169
 carbohydrates we leave at the normal rate 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.960
 somewhere 400 500 grams per day and times in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.880
 one and a half compared to the usual diet 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.350
 increase the amount of protein approximately 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 up to one and a half grams per kilogram of mass 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.120
 body in fact it means what to 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 normal healthy diet we add 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.290
 a couple of protein meals it can 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.840
 be a portion of boiled meat green 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.160
 a protein shake salad or a couple 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.020
 protein bars 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.000
 only this time without extra 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.070
 carbohydrate athlete same who 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.590
 preparing for competitions cuts 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.860
 carbohydrates even more range varies 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.410
 from 50 to 150 grams per day but similar 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.270
 drying is a big burden for the body 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.640
 so if you're not going to go out 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.729
 on the stage it will be enough to consume 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.580
 carbohydrates up to 400 500 grams per day and not 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.010
 it's worth forgetting that 300,400 grams of them 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.800
 must be complex and only fifty 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.139
 a hundred grams are simple by the way when filler 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.750
 fat burning can be 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.880
 mix it up with a delicious homemade smoothie if 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.650
 you have a friend a couple of free minutes for 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.780
 this in a blender mix one two 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.060
 portions of protein powder glass 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.570
 soy milk or plain nonfat 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.940
 of milk 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.000
 add half a cup of wild berries there 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.190
 for example blueberries or raspberries are not fresh 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.380
 berry frost is also perfect 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.039
 also open and empty the capsule 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.870
 enzymes 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.669
 beat this mixture well 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.580
 homogeneous thick consistency 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.840
 It turns out very tasty and nutritious to 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.240
 slimming diet 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.930
 It is also recommended to add 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.120
 vitamin and mineral complexes 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.280
 and you can still use fat burners 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.919
 These are special supplements that will help. 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.630
 get rid of fat faster and more efficiently 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.310
 and at the same time keep typed 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.009
 musculature to find out about them 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.930
 in more detail 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:11.710
 and choose a suitable option for yourself 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:13.779
 look at my issue on this topic 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.149
 Finally, the nutrition program is just for 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:18.939

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.649
 it's great and 4 5 meals a day 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:22.930
 which I talked about in the first part 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:25.389
 release lunch lunch dinner 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.490
 barely having a snack which can be very and 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.710
 very diverse eg handful 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.689
 nuts and some fruit protein 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.969
 the bar and glass of juice is the same 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.830

 some goodies that you dreamed 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.349
 in the period of burning fat but in this case 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.360
 need to be moderate and not to get involved 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:48.939
 You can also drink vitamins and courses. 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.089
 minerals and lemon amino acid supplements 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:53.319
 for example l-lysine and arginine 1 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.959
 capsule 3 times a day 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.159
 it will help strengthen the immune system 

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:59.740
 effectively resist viruses and 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:02.349
 maintain health even when all 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.779
 the rest is squishing my nose and sneezing at me 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:08.939
 there is a release dedicated to their amino acids 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.939
 I recommend using it for viewing 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.990
 and completing the release of another tip for 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.669
