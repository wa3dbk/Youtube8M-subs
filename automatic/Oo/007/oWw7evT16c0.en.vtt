defensive linemen all going down the
exact<00:02:04.170> same<00:02:04.380> way<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> exact

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
same animation that cannot happen in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339 
same animation that cannot happen in
this<00:02:09.119> game<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.110> something

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this game like that that's something

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.040 
this game like that that's something
that<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.250> addressed<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:12.390> has<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.020> be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that has to be addressed that has to be

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.380 
that has to be addressed that has to be
fixed<00:02:13.410> in

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
fixed in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.520 
fixed in
I'm<00:02:14.450> saying<00:02:14.780> because<00:02:15.050> that's<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.319> true

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'm saying because that's the true

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.670 
I'm saying because that's the true
hindrance<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> gameplay<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:18.410> is

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
hindrance of the gameplay and this is

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
to be fixed like they need to address

to be fixed like they need to address
that<00:02:55.280> before<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.450> game<00:02:56.660> ships<00:02:56.989> out<00:02:57.230> because

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
that before the game ships out because

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.740 
that before the game ships out because
it<00:02:57.980> shouldn't<00:02:58.010> take<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.459> slider<00:02:58.850> set<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.360> making

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
it shouldn't take a slider set to making

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.479 
it shouldn't take a slider set to making
you<00:03:00.019> know<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> honestly<00:03:00.800> get<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.100> to

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
you know to honestly get that to

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.210 
you know to honestly get that to
function<00:03:02.150> correctly<00:03:02.470> like<00:03:03.470> as<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.709> see<00:03:04.070> in

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
function correctly like as you see in

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.220 
function correctly like as you see in
that<00:03:04.250> mad<00:03:04.700> know<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.269> example<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.750> see<00:03:06.019> how<00:03:06.170> he

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
that mad know for example you see how he

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.610 
that mad know for example you see how he
cut<00:03:06.760> like<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.000> he<00:03:08.450> came<00:03:08.840> out<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.500> he

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
cut like that he came out of it and he

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.220 
cut like that he came out of it and he
had<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.010> speed<00:03:10.430> burst<00:03:10.910> downfield<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:12.110> know

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
had the speed burst downfield you know

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.280 
had the speed burst downfield you know
versus<00:03:12.680> speed<00:03:12.950> but<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:14.120> last<00:03:14.390> example<00:03:14.720> is

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
versus speed but this last example is

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.920 
versus speed but this last example is
basically<00:03:15.890> showcasing<00:03:16.730> here<00:03:16.940> how<00:03:17.450> people<00:03:17.810> are

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
basically showcasing here how people are

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.140 
basically showcasing here how people are
saying<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.410> still<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> secondary<00:03:19.850> all

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
saying that still in the secondary all

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.240 
saying that still in the secondary all
they<00:03:20.329> do<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.540> slide<00:03:21.049> all<00:03:21.410> they<00:03:21.590> do<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.769> slide

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
they do is slide all they do is slide

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.930 
they do is slide all they do is slide
and<00:03:22.720> backpedal<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.810> they<00:03:23.959> slide<00:03:24.350> not<00:03:25.310> now<00:03:25.760> as

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
and backpedal and they slide not now as

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.180 
and backpedal and they slide not now as
you<00:03:26.120> clearly<00:03:26.390> see<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.620> right<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.040> left

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
you clearly see on the right in left

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.220 
you clearly see on the right in left
