00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and the benefit of that is that the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.609 
and the benefit of that is that the
power<00:02:01.950> delivers<00:02:02.429> smoother<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.899> flipside<00:02:04.349> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
power delivers smoother the flipside is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
power delivers smoother the flipside is
is<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.099> really<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.429> rev<00:02:05.789> this<00:02:06.090> car

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
is that you really have to rev this car

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.009 
is that you really have to rev this car
to<00:02:06.899> enjoy<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.500> performance<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.479> third

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
to enjoy the performance so I'm in third

to enjoy the performance so I'm in third
gear<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.910> now<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> would<00:02:12.239> do<00:02:12.330> 40<00:02:12.629> miles<00:02:12.780> an

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
gear right now I would do 40 miles an

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.350 
gear right now I would do 40 miles an
hour<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.829> floor<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.790> res<00:02:14.970> building

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
hour if I floor it the res building

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.900 
hour if I floor it the res building
doesn't<00:02:15.690> feel<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.019> quick<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.610> starts<00:02:17.849> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
doesn't feel that quick now it starts to

doesn't feel that quick now it starts to
feel<00:02:18.000> quick<00:02:18.239> up<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> 4,000<00:02:18.930> rpm<00:02:19.319> now<00:02:19.349> I'm

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
feel quick up to 4,000 rpm now I'm

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.720 
feel quick up to 4,000 rpm now I'm
really<00:02:19.950> starting<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.220> enjoy<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.610> performance

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
really starting to enjoy the performance

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.699 
really starting to enjoy the performance
as<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.299> hitting<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.569> red<00:02:21.720> light<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.260> I'm

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
as I'm hitting the red light but I'm

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.390 
as I'm hitting the red light but I'm
doing<00:02:23.430> 100<00:02:23.700> miles<00:02:24.390> an<00:02:24.629> hour<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.160> means

doing 100 miles an hour and that means

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.740 
doing 100 miles an hour and that means
you<00:02:26.519> have<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> wind<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.150> engine<00:02:27.599> up<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
you have to wind this engine up to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.710 
you have to wind this engine up to
really<00:02:28.379> enjoy<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> feel<00:02:29.220> its<00:02:29.430> performance<00:02:30.030> at

remember<00:02:38.810> there's<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.019> other<00:02:39.260> option<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.560> was

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
remember there's this other option I was

telling<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> about<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.370> car<00:02:40.610> earlier<00:02:40.970> in

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
telling you about this car earlier in

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.520 
telling you about this car earlier in
the<00:02:41.120> video<00:02:41.209> well<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.140> something<00:02:42.319> called

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the video well it something called

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.880 
the video well it something called
torque<00:02:43.069> vectoring<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.299> it's<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.110> three<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.769> a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
torque vectoring and it's a three and a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910 
torque vectoring and it's a three and a
half<00:02:46.189> grand<00:02:46.879> extra<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:48.290> what<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.500> does<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.829> can

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
half grand extra and what it does it can

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.289 
half grand extra and what it does it can
vary<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.220> amount<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.519> power<00:02:49.730> go<00:02:49.879> into<00:02:50.030> either

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
vary the amount of power go into either

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.449 
vary the amount of power go into either
of<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.870> rear<00:02:51.110> wheels<00:02:51.409> and<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:52.189> gives<00:02:52.400> you

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
of the rear wheels and that gives you

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.309 
of the rear wheels and that gives you
improved<00:02:52.610> grip<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.390> traction<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.170> can

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
improved grip and traction and you can

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.869 
improved grip and traction and you can
choose<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.680> between<00:02:54.950> different<00:02:55.250> modes<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.790> can

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
choose it between different modes it can

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.089 
choose it between different modes it can
have<00:02:56.030> normal<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.959> in<00:02:57.110> slalom<00:02:57.530> for<00:02:57.950> going

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
have normal you have in slalom for going

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.970 
have normal you have in slalom for going
through<00:02:58.190> twisty<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.329> roads<00:02:59.720> or<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.799> have

road and it's fun on the track it feels

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.009 
road and it's fun on the track it feels
a<00:03:09.769> little<00:03:10.010> bit<00:03:10.190> out<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.519> its<00:03:10.819> depth<00:03:11.120> one<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.930> the

a little bit out of its depth one of the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.449 
a little bit out of its depth one of the
main<00:03:12.170> reasons<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.190> cars

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
main reasons for that is this cars

other things that I should point out as
well<00:03:48.889> down<00:03:49.430> here<00:03:49.459> there's<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.030> foot<00:03:50.449> operated

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
well down here there's a foot operated

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.189 
well down here there's a foot operated
parking<00:03:51.709> brake<00:03:51.949> can<00:03:52.190> be<00:03:52.480> really<00:03:53.480> leaning

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
parking brake can be really leaning

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.020 
parking brake can be really leaning
excess<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:55.519> there's<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.849> infotainment

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
excess and then there's the infotainment

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.020 
excess and then there's the infotainment
system<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.930> actually<00:03:57.169> run<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.859> Lexus<00:03:58.430> NX<00:03:58.760> at<00:03:58.940> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
system I actually run a Lexus NX at the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.839 
system I actually run a Lexus NX at the
moment<00:03:59.419> and<00:03:59.629> I<00:04:00.079> still<00:04:00.859> find<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.160> hard<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.639> use

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
moment and I still find it hard to use

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.539 
moment and I still find it hard to use
even<00:04:02.209> after<00:04:02.449> months<00:04:02.629> with<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.019> car<00:04:03.260> I'm<00:04:03.919> lost

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
even after months with that car I'm lost

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.939 
even after months with that car I'm lost
within<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.879> system<00:04:05.180> right<00:04:05.299> now<00:04:05.440> yeah<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
within the system right now yeah the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.040 
within the system right now yeah the
Germans<00:04:07.280> do<00:04:08.150> this<00:04:08.449> kind<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.840> thing<00:04:09.049> better

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
Germans do this kind of thing better

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.410 
Germans do this kind of thing better
then<00:04:10.680> there's<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.100> practicality<00:04:11.880> because

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
then there's the practicality because

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.850 
then there's the practicality because
the<00:04:12.510> RCAF<00:04:12.930> business<00:04:13.290> could<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.590> carrying

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
the RCAF business could have carrying

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.490 
the RCAF business could have carrying
rear<00:04:14.070> passengers<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.880> BMW<00:04:15.540> m4<00:04:15.960> and<00:04:16.230> it's

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
rear passengers as a BMW m4 and it's

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.820 
rear passengers as a BMW m4 and it's
boot<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.250> smaller<00:04:17.580> than<00:04:17.850> an<00:04:18.060> Audi<00:04:18.269> rs5

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.560 

however<00:04:22.830> performance<00:04:23.340> co-pays<00:04:23.700> aren't<00:04:24.270> about

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
however performance co-pays aren't about

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.360 
however performance co-pays aren't about
practicality<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.620> for<00:04:25.740> some<00:04:25.890> people<00:04:26.040> they're

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
practicality and for some people they're

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.710 
practicality and for some people they're
not<00:04:26.490> about<00:04:26.610> being<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> fastest<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.510> on<00:04:27.630> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
not about being the fastest out on the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.690 
not about being the fastest out on the
track<00:04:27.930> or<00:04:28.140> being<00:04:28.380> able<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> do<00:04:28.740> massive<00:04:29.130> drifts

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
track or being able to do massive drifts

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.010 
track or being able to do massive drifts
either<00:04:29.850> they're<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.540> about<00:04:30.660> being<00:04:30.870> able<00:04:30.930> to

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
either they're just about being able to

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.530 
either they're just about being able to
go<00:04:31.170> fast<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.740> looking<00:04:32.460> good<00:04:32.640> while<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.210> do<00:04:33.360> it
