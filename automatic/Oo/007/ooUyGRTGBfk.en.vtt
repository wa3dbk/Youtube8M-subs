00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.270
 ah 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.890
 I hate the current generation of consoles if 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.869
 They listened well I hate you I'm tired of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.960
 get into the videogame forums and 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.599
 find things like the ps3 is shit or 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.110
 things like the wii and it 's crap and also 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.829
 we found the xbox 360 is better than the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.949
 fucking ps3 grill and finally the ps3 is 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.989
 the whore loves the others are shit this is 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.600
 the kind of things that I'm sure 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.670
 a new war of fans will form 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.830
 that I am a nostalgic player like 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.229
 I miss those times when you played 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.390
 mario and sonic at the same time and nobody 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.750
 I used to say bullshit just for being companies 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.689
 rivals as I miss those times when 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.150
 there were no such stupid srb 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:06.880
 stupid things like the casual player or 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.680
 the hardcore when the graphics you 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.750
 they did not give a fuck as long as the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.850
 game out fun and what else you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.040
 What mattered was that the game left you with a 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.689
 feeling and a feeling so great 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 that he really learned to love 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.240
 video game 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.370
 but today there are always those 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.530
 they say that such a game is shit just for 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.300
 not please us or we say that someone is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.880
 shit just for insulting our 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.770
 console and if I also include myself because 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.110
 would be a hypocrite if he said that I do not 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.210
 I do it but still there are those 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.550
 people who say love videogames 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 and be gamers when in my opinion they are not 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.380
 more than novices who are addicted to the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.810
 technology if you ask them they 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.660
 have played epic games like sonic 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.700
 final fantasy 2 are or super trigger 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.190
 mario gobbi with donkey kong country 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.840
 they will tell you that these games are a 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.210
 shit because they're generations 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.369
 passed when in my opinion and I'm 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 sure that in many of those games 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.229
 they have marked us more life than 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.690
 games that currently come out if you 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.550
 ask me why it happens that I 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.700
 I blame technology and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.680
 companies like samsung and evo companies 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.570
 how are you have gotten it into his head to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 the people that the technology power 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.870
 it should always be the factor that determines 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 the value of an entertainment 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.150
 electronic like the graphics the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 power internet connection etc 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.739
 you will say that maybe I contradicted myself 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.019
 a lot and it can be but this feeling 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.060
 that I transmit is nothing other than 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.360
 opinion that comes from the depths of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.400
 soul or at least my soul gamer 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.290
 but it's been a long time and that's how it will be 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.209
 always because they will always exist 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.040
 young people who prefer to play 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.769
 a 'resident evil' to a super mariobros 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.769
 a god of war to a sonic and a gt to a 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.689
 edge of empires many play games 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.060
 just for being hardcore that I think the 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.370
 greater incoherence of the world I prefer 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.889
 play a thousand times a mario party a zelda 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.799
 to a game like call of duty or gears of 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.079
 I did not say that any game of the 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.239
 mentioned is bad only that no longer 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.519
 they wake up that big feeling and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.980
 pleasant that you felt when playing those 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.379
 works of the past that kept you playing 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.900
 and it did not matter how old what taste or what 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.019
 kind of ideology you had was fun 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.420
 for the largest to the smallest 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.819
 good friends the video was very short but 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.040
 I wanted to convey this message I felt the 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.689
 need to do it by the simple geek 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.069
 that I'm from video games and 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.769
 nostalgia that gives me to remember them 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.609
 good friends I say goodbye comment and
