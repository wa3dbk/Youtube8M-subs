00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
think it's absolute and it's now become

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.400 
think it's absolute and it's now become
one<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.669> my<00:00:31.910> favorite<00:00:32.570> professional<00:00:32.960> style

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
all signet cases you do get a screen

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.599 
all signet cases you do get a screen
protector<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:32.630> well<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.079> even<00:01:33.679> though<00:01:34.069> you

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
protector as well and even though you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.300 
protector as well and even though you
don't<00:01:34.759> really<00:01:34.969> need<00:01:35.270> one<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:36.140> use<00:01:36.409> with<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.399 
don't really need one to use with the
Boston<00:01:37.729> case<00:01:37.939> I<00:01:38.179> think<00:01:38.630> that's<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.049> good

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
Boston case I think that's really good

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.969 
Boston case I think that's really good
that<00:01:39.590> they<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.060> incorporator<00:01:41.079> so<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:42.289> is<00:01:42.469> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
that they do incorporator so this is the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.819 
that they do incorporator so this is the
case<00:01:43.189> itself<00:01:43.639> and<00:01:44.049> there<00:01:45.049> is<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.229> small<00:01:45.590> bear

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
case itself and there is a small bear

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.440 
case itself and there is a small bear
phone<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.369> here<00:01:47.090> as<00:01:47.359> well<00:01:47.719> so<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.240> says

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
embossed on the back of the case and if

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.710 
embossed on the back of the case and if
we<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.480> put<00:02:17.690> my<00:02:17.840> iphone<00:02:18.350> 4s<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.540> do

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we just put my iphone 4s in here you do

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.860 
we just put my iphone 4s in here you do
get<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.110> nice<00:02:21.379> tight<00:02:21.950> fit<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.390> know<00:02:23.659> it's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
get that nice tight fit so you know it's

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.970 
get that nice tight fit so you know it's
not<00:02:24.049> going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.290> fall<00:02:24.439> out<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:25.069> there<00:02:25.310> at<00:02:25.549> all

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
not going to fall out of there at all

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.280 
not going to fall out of there at all
the<00:02:27.980> case<00:02:28.219> does<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> flip<00:02:29.450> over<00:02:29.780> strap<00:02:30.079> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the case does have a flip over strap and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
the case does have a flip over strap and
this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.859> magnetic<00:02:31.609> so<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.659> little

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
this is magnetic so that's just a little

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.649 
this is magnetic so that's just a little
bit<00:02:33.079> of<00:02:33.170> added<00:02:33.409> protection<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.909> the<00:02:35.209> Boston

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
bit of added protection to the Boston

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.020 
bit of added protection to the Boston
now<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.650> pull<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:36.950> out<00:02:37.159> it<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.609> quite

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
now to pull this out it is quite

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.979 
now to pull this out it is quite
difficult<00:02:38.359> but<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.469> get<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.889> pull<00:02:40.189> tab

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
difficult but you do get this pull tab

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.629 
difficult but you do get this pull tab
and<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.139> just<00:02:42.349> raises<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.920> iphone<00:02:43.250> 4<00:02:43.430> out

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
and it just raises the iphone 4 out

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.099 
and it just raises the iphone 4 out
which<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:44.629> easily<00:02:45.290> slips<00:02:45.829> out<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.579> case

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
which then easily slips out of the case

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.140 
which then easily slips out of the case
so<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.170> get<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.709> great<00:02:49.040> style<00:02:49.459> design<00:02:49.849> of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
so you get this great style design of

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.750 
so you get this great style design of
the<00:02:50.420> black<00:02:50.689> and<00:02:50.930> white<00:02:51.139> up<00:02:51.379> runs<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the black and white up runs down the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.670 
the black and white up runs down the
center<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.419> the<00:02:53.510> case<00:02:53.900> which<00:02:54.200> kind<00:02:54.469> of<00:02:54.530> looks

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
center of the case which kind of looks

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.429 
center of the case which kind of looks
like<00:02:55.040> racing<00:02:55.999> stripes<00:02:56.299> on<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.930> runs<00:02:57.169> all<00:02:57.409> the

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
like racing stripes on this runs all the

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.819 
like racing stripes on this runs all the
way<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.189> middle<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:59.200> then<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.349> get<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
way down the middle and then you get the

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.649 
way down the middle and then you get the
red<00:03:01.069> insert<00:03:01.549> into<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.879> low<00:03:02.000> credit<00:03:02.329> cards

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
flap which matches really nicely and

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.879 
flap which matches really nicely and
then<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.359> get<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.659> at<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.900> tab<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.560> comes

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
then you get it at the tab that comes

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.550 
then you get it at the tab that comes
over<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.549> top<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:08.569> get<00:03:08.780> great<00:03:09.019> stitching

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
design all the way around the side of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.080 
design all the way around the side of
the<00:03:12.199> case<00:03:12.379> which<00:03:12.739> makes<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.280> look<00:03:13.459> super

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
the case which makes it look super

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.839 
the case which makes it look super
professional<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.469> like<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.919> this<00:03:16.310> isn't

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
professional so like that this isn't

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.909 
professional so like that this isn't
really<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.239> my<00:03:17.329> case<00:03:17.569> of<00:03:17.780> choice<00:03:18.019> or<00:03:18.469> it

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
really in my case of choice or it

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.770 
really in my case of choice or it
wouldn't<00:03:19.219> have<00:03:19.340> been<00:03:19.489> first<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.269> all<00:03:20.389> but
