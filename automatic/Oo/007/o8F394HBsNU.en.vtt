00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
if you can see that there but basically

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.030 
if you can see that there but basically
when<00:01:02.270> I<00:01:02.300> open<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> chicken<00:01:03.380> door<00:01:03.590> it<00:01:03.980> just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
when I open the chicken door it just

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.530 
when I open the chicken door it just
kind<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:05.020> latches<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> made<00:01:08.510> that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
kind of latches in there so I made that

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.490 
kind of latches in there so I made that
out<00:01:08.840> of<00:01:08.870> a<00:01:09.790> an<00:01:10.790> L<00:01:11.300> bracket<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:11.960> cut<00:01:12.230> with<00:01:12.350> an

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
out of a an L bracket that I cut with an

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.370 
out of a an L bracket that I cut with an
angle<00:01:12.800> iron<00:01:12.980> and<00:01:13.190> then<00:01:14.180> I<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.780> put<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.170> here

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
angle iron and then I just put this here

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.910 
angle iron and then I just put this here
to<00:01:15.530> keep<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.280> wood<00:01:16.460> from<00:01:16.490> getting<00:01:17.680> marred<00:01:18.680> up

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
to keep the wood from getting marred up

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.980 
to keep the wood from getting marred up
and<00:01:19.160> then<00:01:19.730> I<00:01:19.760> just<00:01:19.880> used<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.360> simple<00:01:20.570> bungee

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
and then I just used a simple bungee

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.640 
and then I just used a simple bungee
cord<00:01:21.230> as<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:23.030> catch<00:01:23.270> feature<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.960> then

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
cord as the the catch feature and then

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.840 
cord as the the catch feature and then
just<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.280> simple<00:01:25.640> L<00:01:25.880> bracket<00:01:26.450> there<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.710> this<00:01:28.610> is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
just a simple L bracket there so this is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.760 
just a simple L bracket there so this is
kind<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:29.240> I'm<00:01:29.330> going<00:01:29.510> for<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.110> let<00:01:30.530> me<00:01:30.590> see

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
kind of what I'm going for so let me see

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.320 
kind of what I'm going for so let me see
if<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.100> come<00:01:31.280> up<00:01:31.400> with<00:01:31.430> something<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.240> know

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
if I can come up with something you know

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.940 
if I can come up with something you know
maybe<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:32.630> little<00:01:32.840> bit<00:01:33.020> nicer<00:01:33.380> looking<00:01:33.650> for<00:01:33.830> the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
maybe a little bit nicer looking for the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.360 
maybe a little bit nicer looking for the
main<00:01:34.610> garden<00:01:35.000> fence<00:01:35.620> okay<00:01:36.620> so<00:01:36.680> I<00:01:36.890> went<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.250> my

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.770 
need one of these I'm just using it
because<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.000> piece<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.330> metal<00:01:47.479> that's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
because it's a piece of metal that's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.350 
because it's a piece of metal that's
galvanized<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.799> what<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:48.979> have<00:01:49.360> but

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
galvanized and it's what I have but

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.330 
galvanized and it's what I have but
basically<00:01:50.810> I've<00:01:50.930> got<00:01:50.960> two<00:01:51.409> pieces<00:01:51.680> cut<00:01:52.070> out<00:01:52.190> of

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
basically I've got two pieces cut out of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.969 
basically I've got two pieces cut out of
this<00:01:52.460> single<00:01:52.850> bracket<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:54.229> got<00:01:54.620> my<00:01:54.770> little

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
this single bracket I got my little

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.560 
this single bracket I got my little
latch<00:01:55.159> piece<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.820> saw<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.180> chicken

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
latch piece like you saw on the chicken

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.820 
latch piece like you saw on the chicken
coop<00:01:56.810> laughs<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.860> as<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.760> can<00:01:58.909> see<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.830> lines

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
coop laughs and as you can see it lines

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.620 
coop laughs and as you can see it lines
up<00:02:01.040> perfectly<00:02:01.100> with<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.150> basically<00:02:02.330> I

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
up perfectly with that so basically I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.990 
up perfectly with that so basically I
just<00:02:02.780> cut<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.170> there<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:04.549> with<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
just cut that there and then with the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.060 
just cut that there and then with the
scrap<00:02:05.330> material<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.049> made<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.619> little<00:02:06.830> L

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
scrap material I made this little L

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.059 
scrap material I made this little L
bracket<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.090> lines<00:02:08.750> up<00:02:08.929> there<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.530> I

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
bracket so that lines up there and I

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.250 
bracket so that lines up there and I
just<00:02:10.340> cut<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:10.670> here<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:12.019> basically

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
just cut it right here and basically

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.920 
just cut it right here and basically
just<00:02:12.739> folded<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> over<00:02:13.909> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.239> vise<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.689> give

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
just folded it over on the vise to give

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.480 
just folded it over on the vise to give
myself<00:02:15.049> an<00:02:15.379> L<00:02:15.499> bracket

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
myself an L bracket

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.180 
myself an L bracket
so<00:02:17.090> I'll<00:02:17.150> take<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.390> away<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.190> then

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
so I'll take that away and then

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.590 
so I'll take that away and then
basically<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> similar

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
basically it's going to be a similar

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.400 
basically it's going to be a similar
setup<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.770> door<00:02:21.980> kick<00:02:22.330> mechanism<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:24.200> my

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
setup to the door kick mechanism for my

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.060 
setup to the door kick mechanism for my
my<00:02:25.010> trash<00:02:25.400> cabinet<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:27.050> basically<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.470> drilled

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
my trash cabinet so basically I drilled

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.610 
my trash cabinet so basically I drilled
a<00:02:28.280> an<00:02:28.760> extra<00:02:29.210> hole<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.690> I'm<00:02:30.260> not<00:02:30.380> going<00:02:30.530> to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
a an extra hole here I'm not going to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.430 
a an extra hole here I'm not going to
really<00:02:30.710> put<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.250> together<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.640> yet<00:02:32.440> but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
really put these together just yet but

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.290 
really put these together just yet but
basically<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.070> make<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> pivot<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.850> once<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.180> put

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
basically to make a pivot and once I put

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
basically to make a pivot and once I put
some<00:02:35.510> nuts<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.960> washers<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.800> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
some nuts and washers on here this is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.460 
some nuts and washers on here this is
also<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.490> act<00:02:37.700> as<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> stop<00:02:38.090> right<00:02:38.660> here

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
also going to act as a stop right here

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.460 
also going to act as a stop right here
as<00:02:39.680> well<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.480> spring<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.110> guess

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
as well as a is the spring I guess

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.390 
as well as a is the spring I guess
holder<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:44.000> basically<00:02:44.420> once<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.380> fence<00:02:45.980> goes

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
holder so basically once that fence goes

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.970 
holder so basically once that fence goes
in<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.930> hit<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.230> slanted<00:02:48.770> piece

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
in it's going to hit that slanted piece

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.580 
in it's going to hit that slanted piece
pop<00:02:49.430> up<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.270> spring<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.260> want

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
pop up and this spring is going to want

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.200 
pop up and this spring is going to want
to<00:02:51.650> pull<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.010> down<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.550> where<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.820> keeps<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
to pull this down to where it keeps it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
to pull this down to where it keeps it
locked<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.980> give<00:02:55.190> me<00:02:55.930> give<00:02:56.930> me<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.080> few

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
locked so if you give me give me a few

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.340 
locked so if you give me give me a few
minutes<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:58.340> will<00:02:58.910> go<00:02:59.090> install<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.600> or<00:03:00.050> finish

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
minutes I will go install this or finish

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.140 
minutes I will go install this or finish
put<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.650> together<00:03:00.830> install<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.730> we'll

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
put this together install it and we'll

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150 
put this together install it and we'll
see<00:03:02.420> how<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.110> works<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.620> on<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.890> garden

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
see how it works on the on the garden

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.860 
see how it works on the on the garden
fence<00:03:04.310> hopefully<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.270> going<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.600> an

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
fence hopefully it's going to be an

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:30.910 
fence hopefully it's going to be an
improvement<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.590> what<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> already<00:03:07.100> happened
