full 1080p whereas previously I know
some<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.360> guys<00:01:27.479> weren't<00:01:27.840> able<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> watch

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the streams because the resolution was

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
the streams because the resolution was
too<00:01:30.210> high<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.750> you've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.229> loads<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.530> lag<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
too high and you've got loads of lag so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
too high and you've got loads of lag so
if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> weren't<00:01:32.369> previously<00:01:32.820> able<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> watch

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
if you weren't previously able to watch

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
if you weren't previously able to watch
the<00:01:33.810> stream<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.259> did<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.920> now

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the stream but you did want to now

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
the stream but you did want to now
hopefully<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.780> able<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.229> long

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hopefully you should be able to as long

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
hopefully you should be able to as long
as<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> select<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.189> resolution

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
as you select the right resolution

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
as you select the right resolution
setting<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> first<00:01:40.350> thing

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
setting so that's the first thing

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
setting so that's the first thing
obviously<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.400> we've<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.210> far<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.689> I've
