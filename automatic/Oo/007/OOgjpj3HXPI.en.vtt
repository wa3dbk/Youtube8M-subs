00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.530
 i 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.420
 doctor look at you this notoriously 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.310
 to liposculpture tell us what 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.440
 this procedure consists 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.810
 well this procedure consists of 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.050
 remove excess fat that is in the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.789
 body in the area that is most treated in the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.390
 body contour area this 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.560
 includes abdomen back waist 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 obviously it can be done also in 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.120
 arms and legs very well doctor we know 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.309
 that over the years are changing 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.110
 surgical techniques which has 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.480
 developed you to improve this 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.859
 procedure because there are currently in 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.500
 all techniques that are still used 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.930
 much that is the conventional technique and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.090
 laser lipolysis 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.640
 the difference between one and the other is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.070
 the cannula time that the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.410
 laser lipolysis is a cannula that 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.809
 the tip brings a laser this makes the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.970
 fat dissolves faster and in 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.040
 some patients produce less pain and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 less inflammation very well and for what 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.630
 patients liposculpture is indicated 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.020
 It is indicated for them 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.719
 have a skin with good tone that does not 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 have stretch marks and obviously that 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.000
 It is recommended that you exercise after 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 the surgery to tonify this is 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 a process that requires hospitalization 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.890
 it's usually not a surgery that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.289
 is usually ambulatory is performed if in 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.360
 the morning leaves the afternoon natale sana in 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.479
 The night is relatively short 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.280
 disability more or less than 3 to 5 days and 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.579
 that the type of anesthesia is used in 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.860
 the liposculpture in that surgery we can 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.930
 use general anesthesia or anesthesia 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.120
 regional with sedation 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 and the lesson of arahal anesthesia 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.440
 to our soil with the valuation but 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.640
 surgical with good patient doctor 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.730
 what are the cares that should be 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.430
 have the days before surgery 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.320
 It's very important that the patient 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.679
 perform some laboratory tests 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.729
 these exams should be fine 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.950
 very important also a story 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.940
 clinic in the clinical history the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.250
 patient 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 will tell us what diseases have suffered 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.050
 he has suffered them or if he is taking any 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.270
 medication this part is very important 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 Take it into account since no patient 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.370
 that is going to submit to this type of 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.840
 surgeries may be taking 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 medicines as well anticoagulants 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.670
 be 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.819
 acetylsalicylic acid or any 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.969
 medication containing this acid or 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.480
 ginkgo biloba is not very advisable either 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:45.639
 vitamin e or also omega 3 609 since 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.159
 these can produce anticoagulation 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.709
 of blood and cause a complication 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.749
 serious in the post operative very well 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.870
 doctor and what are the results 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.799
 end of liposculpture can be 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.719
 very good 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.480
 this is a surgery that is done in 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.519
 men and women is very important 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.450
 emphasize that the patient have a 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.700
 proper diet should be made 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.730
 therapies and help them is minute fibers and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.680
 waste from surgery and the month is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.359
 important that you start exercising 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.919
 to look for a good toning 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.050
 what are the cares that should be 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.280
 have during the postoperative period 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.130
 basically you have to use a sash in the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.320
 strip to use it minimum for two months in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.360
 some cases we also send foam and 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.810
 table all this looking for the skin to 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.319
 paste properly 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
 the diet as it is before is 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.260
 very important 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600
 and obviously you patients of conscience 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.120
 if not cared for it will lose the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.180
 surgery wants to get fat again I decided 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.080
 do surgery on liposculpture 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 abdomen and with the super fast sides 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.209
 and very nice no attention was great 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.370
 they are very willing to answer 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.930
 all the answers and all the doubts 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:10.040
 which obviously one has as a patient and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.380
 make them very clear as well as how 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.470
 tell a little bit in the surgery how I was going 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.980
 to be the recovery but not very well 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.889
 all doubts clarify the exams of 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.979
 blood 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.189
 and already petro is analyzed in the doctor's 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.939
 July and the anesthesiologist and see if the 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 patient if you are fit for surgery 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:37.060
 plastic they first look at that for 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:40.210
 to be able to decide if yes if it is viable 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.569
 that the next one does that surgery and 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.900
 when I decided to become the chair to give me 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.529
 website and it is very 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.069
 complete because it has pictures have in 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:56.560
 tell about the surgery how it is then 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:05:00.009
 there are also certain so that it does not 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.830
 finally decide to visit it for 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.469
 I was not painful uncomfortable a little bit and 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.419
 the pain then normal suddenly has 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:11.169
 associated seems a little bit to grow 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.320
 a lot of exercise but then I think 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:18.960
 that was a very fast repair 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.170
 or 15 days of incapacity just and now 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.200
 study my normal daily tasks 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.900
 can the recovery was quick then 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.260
 First, because everything is followed 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.690
 by the doctor the belts the medicines 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.190
 the creams that have to be applied because 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.750
 it's important apart from looking 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.000
 pretty the surgery because physically or 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.950
 When it is shown, do not leave 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.490
 few scars can be from surgery 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.860
 but not very judicious strips the table 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.620
 The massage is very important to do 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.650
 Exercise is also important and nothing 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.140
 follow the advice and everything 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.689
 The doctor says how I feel 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:12.049
 prettiest prettiest more 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:16.129
 more sculpture and well anyway was 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:17.929
 a nice change not so radical 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.619
 a nice change besides it looks very 

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:24.229
 good natural I invite you to consult 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:29.389
 Dr. Julio and they consult and 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:35.259
 encourage and I recommend 100% of those 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.259
 assholes and their surgeries and their results
