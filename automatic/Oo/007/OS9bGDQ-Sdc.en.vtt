00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
closer to the ground which means it

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.889 
closer to the ground which means it
doesn't<00:00:45.790> have<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.150> same<00:00:46.360> level<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.780> our

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
frodan capability but what the what that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.810 
frodan capability but what the what that
does<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.230> gives<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.590> interior<00:00:51.370> greater

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
does is it gives the interior greater

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.700
