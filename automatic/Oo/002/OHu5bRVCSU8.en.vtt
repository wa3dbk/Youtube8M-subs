00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.750
 the board 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 well players that still the cause of 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.170
 wrong 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:32.280
 at sea the storm operation of the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 desert of glue haircut of a 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.489
 little bit more 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 but it's good and maciulis that you think 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.390
 a good chuli I see you what 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 the doors must be 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 strong to everyone as we all have 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.070
 and I think our brother that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.259
 team is not a player for big team 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 in command makes winning championships can 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.330
 that those are our two theories now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330
 same 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.170
 one of the two will fail another 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.880
 collaborated surely I already had one 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 that had a mother recently a Lithuanian 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 also that I did not like anything bad 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.840
 state of terenci moix and us of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.319
 this possible lack where the other that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319
 then he left 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.690
 is that some who are kaukenas kaukenas 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 all good that was not loose from the tree 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:03.360
 with almost 40 years 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.360
 if the visitor 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.570
 more takes advantage but is that their aces 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.780
 It's about the interview, well, he said 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:18.100
 which is that he wanted people already 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.100
 experienced week 27 big seven 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 media players from lavrinovic wanted 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.480
 put to felipe kings of 3 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.480
 jaycee carroll was short for the marine 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.340
 first if you had good to Normandy 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.340
 they are pushing 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.239
 the other day the doctor Díaz of movement 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.140
 about about Robert coat the photographer 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.170
 robert coat 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.400
 goes in that first collection on the day 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.690
 of and such was there and in account that 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.519
 enter has not come down in the water to the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.310
 pim beach pam good of those who went from 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.700
 his division we had that were 100 and he 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.160
 they freed 10 and told them and they came back 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.690
 that is the same as they enter I thought that 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.700
 already once he was cast he could not one the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.510
 vicegerent another died and two days 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.150
 then you have the parachute 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.640
 that there were people who did not desert us 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.640
 but to tell them for the ship 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.959
 there are cruises now of those that come down like 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.939
 more aggressive you have to know more about the 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.129
 invasive tourism form because they have 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.349
 clear very fast everything does not have to be lowered 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.829
 two hours a whole city I do not have even 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.260
 put what you drop loose in 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.519
 Capri four cruises at the same time 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.150
 impressions in capri that is prepared 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.319
 like when in 500 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.319
 a railing 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.140
 and then the average age avenue that 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.670
 usually there are on those cruises with the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.840
 Popular prices 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.319
 and then there are rooms with the right to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.319
 Complete engine noise with fire extinguisher inside 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.829
 the one done only once and it was to do 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.299
 an overturning also his lamp 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.320
 I was shocked into the room 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.300
 I had to sleep one night on the boat 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.280
 good until you get the boat and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.169
 issue this type awaits a framework of 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 this is for 2,000 people that is 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.979
 I did not ask them strongly that I did not 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.870
 they left alone even for a moment because 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.979
 government but you go crazy that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.410
 Are you missing do not make flats and we were 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.300
 in a room one of the ones in the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.900
 noble plant 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.160
 it was a suite of the ciborium all luxury and there 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.789
 some that has auditoriums of troops 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.300
 seven hundred thousand people 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.300
 the floating city 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.390
 and people send signals that they are 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.990
 help the captain haircut 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.850
 who gave him this boat with all my 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.330
 respect seems the group manager 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.330
 rumbero 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.560
 the ship is sinking 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.400
 there was something very good I remember a lot of 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.199
 formerly hunger games cabbage 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.490
 that we remember you have seen a game 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.620
 great to rollins I think a dark 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.919
 very powerful a great match with you 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.289
 with fernando martí did not vary 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:51.949
 the mirror is not better than me than me 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.949
 I was there 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:03.050
 it does not hit you in a blockade 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.050
 cutting and a beautiful bad prepare 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.150
 you have done in your monologues have 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.340
 monologues share sports if something 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.990
 can be one basketball is today in 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.430
 day if I could put what happens 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.719
 is that for you for a very public 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.240
 special medal for a very event 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:22.020
 specific I was doing like that for some 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.060
 capture real partners go a lot of success 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.400
 if we did a campaign that beat a 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.350
 historical record from valladolid 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.940
 and they also gave us a prize we were 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.740
 some little things had just got cold 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.199
 sticks the sticks that the partners put 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.090
 so as not to become partners we extend the 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.289
 turn around and you'll say first and second and 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.820
 we beat the record of partners so much 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.889
 first as second is very nice you 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.500
 it's cold in that field of teeth 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.940
 to close before closing it more I am 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.630
 partner and some time ago I'm seeing a 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.460
 against him 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.640
 of you are after was the rye the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.810
 Malaga and I have a good location and I 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.510
 He called a friend from a box Cerro says 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:01.170
 what are you doing there 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:03.450
 and I could not answer and I take refuge 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.500
 there those hostile those 70 practice 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.000
 of any sporting activity 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.200
 the fundamental roof of the good that 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.330
 I was commenting that the good thing about 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.390
 sport basketball the park 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.670
 it is always the same 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.800
 and it's covered and football because 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.560
 it rains such a problem the tacos changes 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.270
 much the climatology of the air of the cold 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.970
 but it's very good and I accept it the most 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.160
 at the moment now with one in the controversy 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.840
 there's that if they sing the anthem in 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.330
 the king's cup had to have done the 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.120
 cup of the king in a field like that that 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:41.850
 it was the inauguration at 82 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:41.850
 it is impossible to step on a machine will start 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.820
 there was played the final of the cup king of 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.860
 win more than 1 0 to valladolid 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.900
 it was inaugurated with a party in the neighbor 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:55.350
 I was watching it, I know that 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.000
 insists on wearing a race team and a 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.690
 team besides curious that team won the 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.940
 life and it is the last team that has 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:06.350
 played with everyone with the same boots 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.350
 all carry the same equipment
