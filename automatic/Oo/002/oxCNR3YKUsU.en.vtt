lesson today we're doing a really big
deal<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:44.010> Dove<00:00:44.129> style<00:00:44.399> lick<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
deal it's or Dove style lick and this is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
deal it's or Dove style lick and this is
inverted<00:00:45.719> double<00:00:46.079> stroke<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> guys<00:00:46.680> don't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
inverted double stroke so you guys don't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
inverted double stroke so you guys don't
know<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.190> inverted<00:00:47.610> double<00:00:47.820> strokes<00:00:48.059> are

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
know what inverted double strokes are

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.819 
know what inverted double strokes are
we're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> break<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.590> we're

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we're going to break that down we're

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.930 
we're going to break that down we're
going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> break<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> couple<00:00:50.610> different

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
going to break down a couple different

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
going to break down a couple different
ways<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.480> use<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> fill<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
ways we can use them as a fill and as a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.709 
ways we can use them as a fill and as a
groove<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.520> well<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> remember<00:00:54.420> what

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
groove as well you have to remember what

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
groove as well you have to remember what
we<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.440> inverted<00:00:55.800> double

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we actually do in inverted double

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
we actually do in inverted double
strokes<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:56.820> simple<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
strokes is very very simple we take the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
strokes is very very simple we take the
very<00:00:58.140> first<00:00:58.590> note<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> double<00:00:59.609> stroke

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
very first note of the double stroke

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
very first note of the double stroke
roll<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.690> cut<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> off<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> start<00:01:01.949> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
roll and we cut it off so we start with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.439 
roll and we cut it off so we start with
only<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.309> single<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.329> continue

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
only a single and then we just continue

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
only a single and then we just continue
like<00:01:03.960> nothing<00:01:04.260> happened<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> does

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
like nothing happened but this does

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
like nothing happened but this does
something<00:01:05.790> interesting<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.360> sets<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.229> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
something interesting it sets off all of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649 
something interesting it sets off all of
the<00:01:07.920> rest<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> notes<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.540> your

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the rest of the notes so all of your

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
the rest of the notes so all of your
right<00:01:10.260> hands<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> fall<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:12.390> an

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
right hands are now going to fall on an

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
right hands are now going to fall on an
A<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> downbeat<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.610> right

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
A and then on the downbeat so your right

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.230 
A and then on the downbeat so your right
hands<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.180> become<00:01:15.509> two<00:01:16.140> three<00:01:17.130> four<00:01:17.880> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hands will become two three four so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
hands will become two three four so
playing<00:01:18.540> double<00:01:18.810> strokes<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:19.320> gives<00:01:19.560> us

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
playing double strokes this way gives us

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
playing double strokes this way gives us
a<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.340> big<00:01:20.520> advantage<00:01:20.640> there's<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
a really really big advantage there's a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.730 
a really really big advantage there's a
lot<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> interesting<00:01:22.020> things<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.560> can

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
lot of interesting things that we can

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
lot of interesting things that we can
create<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.640> ahead<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> start<00:01:24.180> through

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
create let's go ahead and start through

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
create let's go ahead and start through
by<00:01:24.540> playing<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.080> inverted<00:01:25.530> double<00:01:25.830> strokes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
by playing just inverted double strokes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
by playing just inverted double strokes
on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.909> snare<00:01:26.939> drum<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.540> 16th<00:01:28.140> notes<00:01:28.409> we're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
on the snare drum in 16th notes we're

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.569 
on the snare drum in 16th notes we're
going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> keep<00:01:28.890> quarter<00:01:29.220> notes<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
going to keep quarter notes on the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:42.920 
going to keep quarter notes on the
hi-hat

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.270 

all<00:01:43.930> right<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.320> let's<00:01:44.560> make<00:01:44.680> this<00:01:44.890> pattern

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
all right so now let's make this pattern

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.130 
all right so now let's make this pattern
just<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.520> sixteenth<00:01:45.970> note<00:01:46.060> fill<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.869> get<00:01:47.049> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
just a sixteenth note fill to get the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.359 
just a sixteenth note fill to get the
feel<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.619> down<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:47.950> we're<00:01:48.040> going<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.220> play<00:01:48.340> a

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
feel of it down so we're going to play a

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.730 
feel of it down so we're going to play a
slow<00:01:48.729> groove<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.630> into<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> sixteenth<00:01:50.649> note

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
slow groove go into a sixteenth note

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.260 
slow groove go into a sixteenth note
fill<00:01:51.159> which<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.460> going<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:51.729> inverted

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
fill which is going to be inverted

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.789 
fill which is going to be inverted
double<00:01:52.570> strokes<00:01:52.840> on<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> snare<00:01:53.170> drum<00:01:53.409> and

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
double strokes on the snare drum and

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:08.609 
double strokes on the snare drum and
then<00:01:53.890> back<00:01:54.070> into<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.399> same<00:01:54.640> group<00:02:07.470> all<00:02:08.470> right

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
then back into that same group all right

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.660 
then back into that same group all right
guys<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:08.860> now<00:02:08.890> we're<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> take<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.489> look

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
guys so now we're going to take a look

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.120 
guys so now we're going to take a look
at<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.090> inverted<00:02:10.810> double<00:02:11.200> stroke<00:02:11.470> idea<00:02:11.830> and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
at this inverted double stroke idea and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.440 
at this inverted double stroke idea and
we're<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.550> put<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.790> into<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> groove<00:02:13.269> now

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
we're going to put it into a groove now

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.030 
we're going to put it into a groove now
that<00:02:13.630> groove<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.959> going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.140> be<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.319> 32nd<00:02:14.920> note

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
that groove is going to be in 32nd note

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.289 
that groove is going to be in 32nd note
so<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.190> need<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.640> these<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> moderate

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
so you need to have these at a moderate

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.150 
so you need to have these at a moderate
speed<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.140> rather<00:02:17.350> than<00:02:17.560> break<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:17.920> whole

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
speed so rather than break this whole

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.979

it as well let's go ahead and try and
match<00:04:14.100> those<00:04:14.400> up

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.590 

so<00:04:33.669> we're<00:04:33.790> going<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:33.940> do<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.150> start<00:04:34.330> out<00:04:34.419> this

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
so we're going to do to start out this

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.580 
so we're going to do to start out this
fills<00:04:34.840> we're<00:04:35.020> actually<00:04:35.169> going<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.440> be
