00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 continue to pass the card called 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.450
 meaningless button 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.330
 and this is most likely the final part 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 our passage with you and how you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.340
 remember in the previous part we passed 4 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.550
 beans and we only have one left and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.830
 it is the god of his power just the same today we are 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.949
 and go step on the pressure plate and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.279
 where does it teleport us so apparently 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 step here we teleported incomprehensible 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.399
 where are the residents so next for shrimp 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.399
 style he should lift the weight 15 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 kilogram and hold it for 5 seconds you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.340
 ready he raised he couldn't lift her 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 ha ha ha for the first time it seems 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.579
 they think about me in the chat they think that I 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 loser 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 I ’m showing you now that I ’m getting better and I can 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 personal trainer first task kill 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.979
 evil sheep x 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.830
 that is, I have to kill all my sheep 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 well, let's start with you okay 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.000
 not so strictly personal trainer 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 sorry lamb nothing personal 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.119
 I need weights 15 kilograms to understand one 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.689
 door clarify so come on two sheep already 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.880
 killed so do you need to throw these boats 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.570
 gets gets get so still 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.570
 okay so only 2 sheep left 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.810
 one sheep and 2 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.510
 so I almost managed 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 and I was already told bald ok 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:57.259
 the second task is to build a shelter something 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.149
 need to build in 20 seconds already started 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.640
 oh so right now it's going to rain from dynamite 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 than I understood it should be built soon 10 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.200
 seconds left no no I don't want 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.390
 dying i wanna survive so on not all there 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 built up to do so 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.630
 oh-oh-oh-oh-th rain of dynamite rain 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 from dynamite 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 enough so I hope to survive oh fine i'm 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.820
 survived and so on I need a fishing rod 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 apparently knock down these piglets 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.590
 get get stop 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.080
 stupid and both are all perfectly asking for all shot down 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.550
 okay but the fourth task 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.000
 orchid pin to pin I don’t remember how 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.880
 translated quarrel 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.739
 sorry pinata died and it seems somehow 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.570
 I will take out here he pinata he hanged himself or 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 they hanged him most likely ok 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.720
 unsuccessfully so we have further 5 task in 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.470
 the dark these 5 and the task is called 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.420
 darkness 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.799
 so you must know the darkness 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.910
 because you never know what 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.620
 waiting for you in the dark 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.040
 we go into the dark so apparently we need 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.049
 to be guided by this one pebble 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.519
 we go altogether in the very darkness i 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.260
 actually see nothing except here 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:30.250
 of these pebbles since it's dark oh 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:36.250
 damn I fell somewhere so here 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.470
 the price here is not a maze so so 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.390
 well well 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.150
 then she's so jump here for something else 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.170
 it is seen oh and we passed perfectly dark we 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 passed all right wonderful hah so i 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.500
 Apparently the type of pumped up and now I will try 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.270
 lift this weight here 15 kilograms 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.730
 so shrimp standing lifts weights 15 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.160
 kilogram he got it not 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.010
 enough a millimeter or something not all 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.540
 everything is fine 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.300
 and a great section 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.070
 that i'm pumped up i'm generally gone all 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:23.590
 five gods I became smarter smarter 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.710
 stronger and braver and intellectually 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.270
 richer something like that in general, then yes I did 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.950
 this is the final 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.520
 need to click on the final button on on 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:42.729
 meaningless button so i will be for you 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:46.080
 happy real card something 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.660
 begins so i spent my whole life 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.880
 let's click on this ok button so there she is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.700
 this button I will see now we together 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.340
 you click on it so I’m almost there and 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.340
 and and meaningless button so about three 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.590
 click on it once or twice and all the forces on 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.850
 press it and nothing happens 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.270
 nothing happens even in chat so 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.080
 wrote nothing happened what what what 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.940
 this is the end ok we passed the card we passed 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.250
 this card is excellent excellent we went through this 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.460
 card i'm very happy so make a card 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.290
 some kind of dude thanks for playing there 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.090
 write reviews here and he writes 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.400
 check there my other tyry-pyry cards 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.580
 In general, it is clear here all sorts of questions 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.630
 the author sets the author well done on the 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.460
 I will thank you very much 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.320
 that is, this map was done and by the way 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.840
 how many developers made this map 3 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.800
 then 4 5 6 7 8 9 developers did 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.370
 this card looks like 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.660
 cool cool not with it at all separately 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.700
 thank you card actually 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.850
 wonderful and main idea 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.670
 original meaningless button and all 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.550
 Five gods pass, too, was very 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.530
 even fun and on this I think we need 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.290
 finish so here is no dynamite 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.350
 no blow nothing left only 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.570
 fishing rods all inventory was gone and what does 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.070
 it we end we passed it 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.850
 pretty quick final part 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.530
 probably the shortest but most importantly 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.020
 that we passed this card and the card was on 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.630
 really interesting in general guys on 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.970
 this we will finish i hope that this 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.500
 you liked the video also hope that 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.650
 did you like this card 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.200
 well and you had a shrimp subscribe 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.620
 put the huskies on the canal 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.620
 until
