hey guys here with another tutorial this

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.600 
hey guys here with another tutorial this
one<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.049> be<00:00:07.259> over<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> make

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
one is going to be over how to make

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.970 
one is going to be over how to make
grass<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.450> blenders<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.139> let's<00:00:10.440> get<00:00:10.590> started

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
grass and blenders so let's get started

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.820 
grass and blenders so let's get started
all<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:12.080> do<00:00:13.080> away<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.530> godforsaken

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
all right do away with this godforsaken

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
all right do away with this godforsaken
brick<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:14.790> nobody<00:00:15.089> ever<00:00:15.330> needs<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.870> don't

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
brick because nobody ever needs it don't

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.630 
brick because nobody ever needs it don't
know<00:00:16.199> why<00:00:16.320> they<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.460> was<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
know why they start with that it was the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.370 
know why they start with that it was the
plain<00:00:17.850> thanks<00:00:18.390> alright<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.199> go<00:00:19.320> ahead

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
plain thanks alright so let's go ahead

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.250 
plain thanks alright so let's go ahead
scale<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> little<00:00:20.100> bit<00:00:20.279> boom<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:22.080> are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
scale it up a little bit boom now we are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.900 
scale it up a little bit boom now we are
going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> particles<00:00:25.859> add<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
going to go to the particles add a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.300 
going to go to the particles add a
particle<00:00:27.269> particle<00:00:27.900> system<00:00:28.170> down<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.160> where

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
particle particle system down here where

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.130 
particle particle system down here where
it<00:00:29.400> says<00:00:29.460> emitter<00:00:29.910> I'm<00:00:30.390> gonna<00:00:30.539> click<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it says emitter I'm gonna click that and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.659 
it says emitter I'm gonna click that and
we're<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.439> turn<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> hair

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
we're going to turn that into a hair

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.360 
we're going to turn that into a hair
alright<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> long<00:00:35.100> hair

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
alright so that's kind of long hair

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
alright so that's kind of long hair
right<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
right now what we want to do is go to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540 
right now what we want to do is go to
advanced<00:00:37.350> settings<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.219> give<00:00:38.370> us<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
advanced settings that will give us a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.299 
advanced settings that will give us a
couple<00:00:38.670> more<00:00:38.910> options<00:00:39.559> go<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
couple more options go down here to the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.569 
couple more options go down here to the
velocity<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.320> hit<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> normal<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.430> bit

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
velocity and hit the normal a little bit

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
velocity and hit the normal a little bit
that<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:44.940> shorten<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> more

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that will shorten it to a more

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
that will shorten it to a more
reasonable<00:00:46.500> height<00:00:47.570> let's<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.719> ahead<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
reasonable height let's go ahead and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.529 
reasonable height let's go ahead and
move<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> along<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.190> bit<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.090 

let's<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:55.500> ahead<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.739> randomize<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
let's see go ahead and randomize a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
let's see go ahead and randomize a
little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.239> analyze<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> too

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
little bit now if your analyze it too

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.650 
little bit now if your analyze it too
much<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.170> turns<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:59.270> I'll<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
much it turns into I'll know the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.349 
much it turns into I'll know the
internet<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:02.399> web<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> lives<00:01:03.090> or

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
internet or some web of lives or

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
internet or some web of lives or
something<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.780> though<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:03.989> anyway<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
something on though so anyway we just

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.240 
something on though so anyway we just
need<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.510> random

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
need it to be a little bit random

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
need it to be a little bit random
yeah<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.720> all<00:01:09.720> right<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> little

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
yeah there all right go down a little

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
yeah there all right go down a little
bit<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.189> physics<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.720> already<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.200> Newtonian

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
bit more physics is already on Newtonian

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.940 
bit more physics is already on Newtonian
let's<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.850> ahead<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.780> Brownian<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
let's go ahead and up the Brownian I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
let's go ahead and up the Brownian I
honestly<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.909> why<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.180> called<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
honestly don't know why it's called that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.039 
honestly don't know why it's called that
but<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.460> spins<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.180> hairs<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.840> bit

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
but it just spins the hairs a little bit

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.620 
but it just spins the hairs a little bit
more<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> grass<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
more now I know that this grass is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.490 
more now I know that this grass is
looking<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.770> weak<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> up

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
looking a little bit weak so we can up

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.840 
looking a little bit weak so we can up
the<00:01:28.680> amount<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> show<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the amount but I just want to show you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
the amount but I just want to show you
all<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.479> effects<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.860> having

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
all the effects that things are having

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.270 
all the effects that things are having
right<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.570> first<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:35.720> premier<00:01:36.720> we're<00:01:36.990> gonna

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
right now first so premier we're gonna

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
right now first so premier we're gonna
go<00:01:38.280> ahead<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.509> click<00:01:39.509> open<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> adaptive

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
go ahead and click open that adaptive

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.999 
go ahead and click open that adaptive
render<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.979> spleen<00:01:42.049> hit<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> random<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
render and be spleen hit the random a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.400 
render and be spleen hit the random a
little<00:01:44.700> bit

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.620 

yeah<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:49.040> way<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.760> give<00:01:49.880> them<00:01:50.000> random

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
yeah that way you just give them random

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.000 
yeah that way you just give them random
heights<00:01:50.810> rather<00:01:51.230> than<00:01:51.440> them<00:01:51.590> all<00:01:51.710> being<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
heights rather than them all being the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.730 
heights rather than them all being the
same<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.310> all<00:01:53.300> right<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.690> that's<00:01:54.380> essentially

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
same I all right so that's essentially

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.350 
same I all right so that's essentially
what<00:01:54.980> that<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.310> let's<00:01:55.610> go<00:01:55.730> ahead<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:58.120> hit<00:01:59.120> this

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
what that is let's go ahead and hit this

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.610 
what that is let's go ahead and hit this
um<00:02:02.470> all<00:02:03.470> right<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.840> yes<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.050> could<00:02:06.110> say<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
um all right and yes I could say the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
go here to material hidden ooh

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.250 
go here to material hidden ooh
all<00:02:18.350> right<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:20.000> gonna<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.540> material

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
all right we I'm gonna do with material

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.590 
all right we I'm gonna do with material
one<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.100> going<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.340> name<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:23.110> dirt<00:02:24.459> and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
then I'm going to make a second material

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.670 
then I'm going to make a second material
and<00:02:28.930> name<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.160> grass<00:02:31.720> okay<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:33.140> I'll<00:02:33.380> name<00:02:33.650> it

grass all right what we're gonna do with

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.610 
grass all right what we're gonna do with
material<00:02:37.580> two<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:38.060> we're<00:02:38.959> going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.260> hit<00:02:39.560> that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
material two is we're going to hit that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.890 
material two is we're going to hit that
with<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.130> little<00:02:40.310> bit<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.550> green<00:02:40.820> BAM<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.120> the

yeah there we are so alright so as you
can<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:55.209> dirt<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:57.610> there<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.390> grass

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
can see the dirt I have there the grass

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.750 
can see the dirt I have there the grass
is<00:03:00.140> green<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.680> not<00:03:00.739> showing<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.549> but

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
is green it's not showing up here but

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.039 
is green it's not showing up here but
what<00:03:01.910> I'm<00:03:02.030> going<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.330> do<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.310> grass<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:05.049> on

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
what I'm going to do is the grass is on

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.880 
what I'm going to do is the grass is on
the<00:03:06.950> second<00:03:07.370> material<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.500> now<00:03:09.709> is

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
the second material like can do now is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.960 
the second material like can do now is
go<00:03:10.100> back<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.720> particles<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.910> go<00:03:13.910> to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
go back to the particles and go to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.370 
go back to the particles and go to
render<00:03:14.650> render<00:03:15.650> material<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:18.110> turns

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
render render material to and that turns

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.979 
render render material to and that turns
that<00:03:18.470> green<00:03:18.799> now<00:03:19.640> you'll<00:03:20.060> see<00:03:20.269> when<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.480> hit<00:03:20.630> f12

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
that green now you'll see when I hit f12

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.590 
that green now you'll see when I hit f12
I<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:24.260> grown<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:25.160> pretty<00:03:26.000> decent<00:03:26.360> looking

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
I have grown a pretty decent looking

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.120 
I have grown a pretty decent looking
lawn<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.290> do<00:03:27.350> say<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:27.620> myself

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
lawn if I do say so myself

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.100 
lawn if I do say so myself
um<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.989> thing<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.380> do<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:31.600> really<00:03:32.600> with

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
um one thing you can do not really with

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.740 
um one thing you can do not really with
the<00:03:33.230> grass<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.640> with<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.090> lighting<00:03:35.540> is

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
the grass but just with the lighting is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.370 
the grass but just with the lighting is
you<00:03:36.530> can<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:36.739> ahead<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.900> change<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.080> lamps

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
you can go ahead and change the lamps

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.110 
you can go ahead and change the lamps
around<00:03:39.650> some<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.190> let's<00:03:40.370> go<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.850> lamp

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
around some so let's go to this lamp

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.979 
around some so let's go to this lamp
turn<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:41.959> into<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.230> spotlight<00:03:43.810> let's<00:03:44.810> make

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
turn this into a spotlight let's make

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.050 
turn this into a spotlight let's make
this<00:03:45.260> mimic<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.040> Sun<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.760> we're<00:03:46.880> going<00:03:47.000> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
this mimic the Sun so we're going to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.630 
this mimic the Sun so we're going to
make

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
make

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.950 
make
yellow<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.040> energy<00:03:50.400> was<00:03:51.030> bumped<00:03:51.390> up<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.600> five

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
yellow the energy was bumped up to five

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.170 
yellow the energy was bumped up to five
and<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:52.820> we<00:03:53.820> are<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.480> add<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:55.130> second<00:03:56.180> ID

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and then we are going to add a second ID

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.510 
and then we are going to add a second ID
if<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.390> learn<00:03:57.600> how<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.720> click<00:03:57.990> things<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.740> second

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
if I learn how to click things a second

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.470 
if I learn how to click things a second
lamp<00:04:00.320> another<00:04:02.300> spotlight<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:05.370> lift<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.270> up

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
lamp another spotlight and lift that up

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.130 
lamp another spotlight and lift that up
a<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:06.720> bit

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
a little bit

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.290 
a little bit
slide<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.340> aside<00:04:10.820> rotate<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> little

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
slide that aside rotate that a little

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.370 
slide that aside rotate that a little
bit<00:04:12.450> by<00:04:12.600> pressing<00:04:13.110> R<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.900> are<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.290> to

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
bit by pressing R and we are going to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.580 
bit by pressing R and we are going to
hit<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.739> one<00:04:16.980> with<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.340> bit<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.580> blue

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
hit this one with a little bit of blue

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.530 
hit this one with a little bit of blue
whereas<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.950> yellow<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.760> Sun<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.450> blue

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
whereas the yellow is the Sun the blue

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.140 
whereas the yellow is the Sun the blue
is<00:04:21.930> going<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.260> be<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.470> sky<00:04:22.710> reflector<00:04:23.430> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
is going to be the sky reflector the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
is going to be the sky reflector the
kind<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.750> refraction<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.350> light<00:04:25.410> from<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
kind of refraction of the light from the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.280 
kind of refraction of the light from the
sky<00:04:25.980> we'll<00:04:26.250> go<00:04:26.370> ahead<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:27.020> change<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.230> to

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
sky we'll go ahead and change that to

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.720 
sky we'll go ahead and change that to
energy<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:28.980> three<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.120> render<00:04:34.730> that's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
energy of three and if you render that's

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.030 
energy of three and if you render that's
a<00:04:35.910> little<00:04:36.360> bit<00:04:36.480> bright<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.930> Sun<00:04:37.140> side<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.770> I

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
a little bit bright on the Sun side so I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.470 
a little bit bright on the Sun side so I
can<00:04:38.880> lift<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.510> light<00:04:39.720> or<00:04:40.070> lower<00:04:41.330> let's<00:04:42.330> just
