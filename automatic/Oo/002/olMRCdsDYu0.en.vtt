00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
yarns the rainstick it's very damp out
here<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:53.969> rain<00:00:54.180> stick<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.480> collapsing<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
here so my rain stick is collapsing a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
here so my rain stick is collapsing a
little<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.030> follow<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.600> lines<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little or you can follow the lines that

little or you can follow the lines that
are<00:00:58.350> already<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.460> rain<00:00:59.640> stick<00:00:59.809> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
are already there on your rain stick and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
are already there on your rain stick and
take<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> yarn<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> use<00:01:04.199> two

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
take the yarn with you I like to use two

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
take the yarn with you I like to use two
different<00:01:04.589> colors<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.119> gives<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
different colors because it gives it a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
different colors because it gives it a
little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.380> appeal<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
little bit more of an appeal so you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.990 
little bit more of an appeal so you
would<00:01:09.360> want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.750> ahead<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> put<00:01:10.670> glue<00:01:11.670> on

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

would want to go ahead and put glue on
your<00:01:12.090> rain<00:01:12.540> stick

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
your rain stick

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
your rain stick
probably<00:01:13.799> craft<00:01:14.130> glue<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:15.390> have

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
probably craft glue but you don't have

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
probably craft glue but you don't have
to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> ahead<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.310> always

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to do it ahead of time you can always

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.539 
to do it ahead of time you can always
glue<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> end<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> follow<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
glue it at the end so you follow the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
glue it at the end so you follow the
line<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> spiral<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:23.960> your

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
line if you want it to spiral down your

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.300 
line if you want it to spiral down your
rain<00:01:25.200> stick<00:01:30.259> cut<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> glue<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
rain stick cut it off and glue it and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
rain stick cut it off and glue it and
then<00:01:32.880> start<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.570> again<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:34.140> another

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
then start over again with another

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.340 
then start over again with another
spiral<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.700> around

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
spiral all the way around

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.910 
spiral all the way around
my<00:01:37.350> poor<00:01:37.680> rain<00:01:37.950> stick<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.460> liking<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
my poor rain stick is not liking this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
my poor rain stick is not liking this
it's<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.040> liking<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> rain<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.329> because

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it's not liking the rain that's because

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's not liking the rain that's because
it's<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> cactus<00:01:43.640> another<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:45.119> neat

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it's not a cactus another really neat

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's not a cactus another really neat
way<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> cover<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> rain<00:01:46.590> stick<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> give<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
way to cover a rain stick and give it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
way to cover a rain stick and give it
fabric<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.630> jute

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
fabric I think is with jute

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.370 
fabric I think is with jute
because<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> natural<00:01:50.340> fabric<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:51.689> natural

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
because it is a natural fabric a natural

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
because it is a natural fabric a natural
fiber<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.399> course<00:01:53.579> rain<00:01:53.790> sticks<00:01:54.119> were

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
fiber and of course rain sticks were

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.530 
fiber and of course rain sticks were
made<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.840> cacti<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> same

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
made from cacti you can do the same

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.139 
made from cacti you can do the same
thing<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.170> follow<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.799> spiral<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.850> or

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
thing you can follow your spiral down or

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.050 
thing you can follow your spiral down or
you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.770> maybe<00:02:02.280> hold<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.820> with

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you can put it on maybe hold it on with

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.539 
you can put it on maybe hold it on with
a<00:02:03.090> pin<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.600> paper<00:02:03.869> clip<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.409> start<00:02:04.469> let's<00:02:05.340> try

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
a pin or a paper clip to start let's try

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:14.839 
a pin or a paper clip to start let's try
a<00:02:05.579> big<00:02:05.820> headed<00:02:06.090> pin<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.960> works

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.789 

and<00:02:15.849> then<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.209> can<00:02:16.390> glue<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.079> in<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.500> spy

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
and then you can glue this on in a spy

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.339 
and then you can glue this on in a spy
in<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.219> spiral<00:02:18.579> all<00:02:18.939> the<00:02:19.060> way<00:02:19.150> around<00:02:19.510> not<00:02:20.290> only

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
in a spiral all the way around not only

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.110 
in a spiral all the way around not only
does<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:20.920> give<00:02:21.099> your<00:02:21.310> rainstick<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.849> nice

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
does this give your rainstick a nice

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.869 
does this give your rainstick a nice
texture<00:02:22.719> but<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.319> also<00:02:23.530> muffles<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.219> sound<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
texture but it also muffles the sound a

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.879 
texture but it also muffles the sound a
little<00:02:24.909> bit<00:02:25.239> more<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.079> you<00:02:26.109> again<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.709> have

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:26.889 
little bit more so you again you have

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.119 
little bit more so you again you have
even<00:02:27.459> more<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.120> natural<00:02:28.389> sound<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
even more of a natural sound when you

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.890 
even more of a natural sound when you
finish<00:02:30.489> all<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.879> way<00:02:31.000> around<00:02:31.329> with<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.629> jute

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
finish all the way around with the jute

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.080 
finish all the way around with the jute
you<00:02:32.530> might<00:02:32.769> want<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.069> take<00:02:33.280> an<00:02:33.430> extra<00:02:33.760> piece

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
you might want to take an extra piece

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.530 
you might want to take an extra piece
and<00:02:34.450> tie<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.349> with<00:02:36.310> maybe<00:02:36.579> some<00:02:36.879> feathers<00:02:37.299> or

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and tie it with maybe some feathers or

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.839 
and tie it with maybe some feathers or
something<00:02:37.900> else<00:02:38.079> natural<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.980> that's<00:02:39.549> the

something else natural and that's the

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.289 
something else natural and that's the
way<00:02:39.969> you<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.389> use<00:02:40.750> yarn<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:41.859> jute<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.879> decorate
