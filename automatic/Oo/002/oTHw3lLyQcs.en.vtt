00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and that time period really fascinating

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.770 
and that time period really fascinating
so<00:03:00.840> they're<00:03:00.989> actually<00:03:01.350> nice<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:03.090> writing

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
so they're actually nice and the writing

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.110 
so they're actually nice and the writing
style<00:03:04.110> as<00:03:04.380> well<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.980> amazing<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:05.970> so

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
style as well is amazing it's so

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.199 
style as well is amazing it's so
well-written<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:08.700> interesting

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
well-written and it's really interesting

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.720 
well-written and it's really interesting
because<00:03:09.540> although<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> pros<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.250> written<00:03:11.580> in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
because although the pros are written in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.110 
because although the pros are written in
a<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.090> pure<00:03:13.549> traditional<00:03:14.549> form<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.940> English

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
a more pure traditional form of English

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.449 
a more pure traditional form of English
that<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.959> would<00:03:16.140> find<00:03:16.380> obviously<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:17.070> England

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
that you would find obviously in England

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.530 
that you would find obviously in England
and<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.320> actual<00:03:19.850> look<00:03:20.850> at<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.360> actual

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and the actual look at the actual

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.140 
and the actual look at the actual
dialogue<00:03:22.019> between<00:03:22.500> characters<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.700> scotts

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
dialogue between characters is in scotts

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.130 
dialogue between characters is in scotts
so<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.910> again<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.090> realistic<00:03:27.660> because

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
so and again that's realistic because

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.560 
so and again that's realistic because
it's<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> way<00:03:28.769> they<00:03:28.980> would<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.549> speaking<00:03:30.030> but

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
it's the way they would be speaking but

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.259 
it's the way they would be speaking but
it's<00:03:30.750> not<00:03:31.079> em<00:03:31.610> accessible<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.790> people<00:03:32.970> that

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it's not em accessible to people that

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.720 
it's not em accessible to people that
aren't<00:03:33.570> Scottish<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.220> puzzle<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
aren't Scottish because the puzzle is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.360 
aren't Scottish because the puzzle is
written<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.390> English<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:38.040> makes<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
written in English and it makes it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.160 
written in English and it makes it
accessible<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.940> everybody<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:40.019> read

the words it's hard for me to sort of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.130 
the words it's hard for me to sort of

that's<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.739> Scott<00:03:49.980> shooting<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:50.910> I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that's not Scott shooting this because I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.569 
that's not Scott shooting this because I
am<00:03:51.269> familiar<00:03:51.480> with<00:03:51.750> Scottish<00:03:52.380> language<00:03:53.280> and

am familiar with Scottish language and

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.140 
am familiar with Scottish language and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
dialect but and most of our I feel is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.140 
dialect but and most of our I feel is
quite<00:03:57.750> easy<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.079> follow<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.790> words<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.000> might

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
quite easy to follow and words you might

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.479 
quite easy to follow and words you might
not<00:04:00.299> understand<00:04:00.930> terms<00:04:01.500> better<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.370> of

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
not understand terms better the kind of

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.670 
not understand terms better the kind of
thing<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.970> could<00:04:03.450> easily<00:04:03.570> look<00:04:03.930> up<00:04:04.140> or<00:04:04.380> would

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
thing you could easily look up or would

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.120 
thing you could easily look up or would
just<00:04:05.329> figure<00:04:06.329> out<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.140> meaning<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.590> as<00:04:07.890> you're

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
just figure out the meaning of as you're

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.949 
just figure out the meaning of as you're
reading<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.180> do<00:04:09.329> with<00:04:09.600> lots<00:04:09.810> of

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
reading like you can do with lots of

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.060 
reading like you can do with lots of
books<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:11.610> think<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.989> really<00:04:13.890> like

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
books and I think that I I really like

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.860 
books and I think that I I really like
that<00:04:14.100> was<00:04:14.640> really<00:04:14.790> pleasant<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.359> think<00:04:15.660> for

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
that was really pleasant and I think for

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.900 
that was really pleasant and I think for
someone<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.410> even<00:04:16.739> isn't<00:04:17.070> familiar<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
someone that even isn't familiar and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.280 
someone that even isn't familiar and
with<00:04:18.299> Scotts<00:04:18.600> would

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
with Scotts would

period<00:05:17.820> but<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.420> also<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:19.050> used<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:20.040> reflect

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
period but that also is used to reflect

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.110 
period but that also is used to reflect
the<00:05:20.790> different<00:05:20.940> period<00:05:21.450> increases<00:05:21.900> life<00:05:22.230> and

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
the different period increases life and

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.400 
the different period increases life and
