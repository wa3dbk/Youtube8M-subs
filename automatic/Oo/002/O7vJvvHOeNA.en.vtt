00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.080
 well, it's just clear 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.180
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.309
 new tutorial on gta 5 for my 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.940
 first time I will teach you 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.000
 how to have rain is limited 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.930
 so we'll do it right now 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.590
 here you are diving into the water or all 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.880
 just to snorkel and 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.740
 in fact I wanted the bar down to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.069
 right and balmed soon weaken and 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.640
 and I would have called more in fact that's it 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:38.350
 the daphne beard you'll see that as soon 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.749
 as the bar will flash butcher ball 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.460
 we are going to tell who we should do almost 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:47.019
 tutorial goal of gta 5 6 this is then 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 the players just enough 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.010
 would make it very simple and in fact if you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.120
 want to ball so I chose frankly 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.409
 coach but you can choose 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.510
 any player 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.309
 frankly it does not matter 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.039
 but not the player who will change 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.969
 something at the third so here we go 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.070
 then attract numbers in China and there 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.930
 we resume to see so deal with him 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.790
 I was in the water I do not have any 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.040
 properties not in the water otherwise will and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.840
 forests all earlier so here he has in 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 do we will be still in the water except 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.020
 we will do our snorkeling suddenly we 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.910
 can go even further it is 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.640
 as his we'll get you a bottle 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.550
 of oxygen so I keep bent I 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 have gone several times from this tutorial for 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.670
 to go further possible we have 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.710
 could hold so that's fine it allows you 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.210
 to visit everything and then 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.950
 in the notebook charles everyone 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 it was iraq and at the next
