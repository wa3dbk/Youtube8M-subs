00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 page we have to draw a game 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.509
 gold in our public in the corner of news in 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.150
 Gauls decided I apologize where you can 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.380
 just subscribing to do through baby doll 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 repost our records and leave 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.000
 comment win its how many thousands 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.410
 up to 1000 gold for contacts in twitch and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.189
 the set is written there and see the opposite 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 so anyway gold will be yes friends 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.000
 gold storms every look for the second fight 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.769
 this map mines are nothing yet 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 Understanding unity while losing the score 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 that they made a serious mistake and here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 on the second seint card 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.079
 initially locked with scarab protection on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 the transplant will stand behind the farthest 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.719
 barn 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 spectrum along with java itself on the basin 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.850
 heavy machinery and here it is amiga along with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 democrat om and cynicism is work through 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 the island of saint is initially locked in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.750
 deaf defense and remembering here 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 match the same unity when they played 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 against month one sudden you out 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.469
 devyastika from the mountain and all this tactic 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 may know a little shake 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.109
 smoothed out the same can be said that the total 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 son afraid 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 unity and just play on hold accounts 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.619
 now yes now when they won all 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 Do the same here as we consider 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 have seen tatev breaks from the bottom base 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.790
 and something really not yet effective 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.830
 maidens tactics sometimes breaks mines 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 all sorts of situations when and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 and unity lose like that but we 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 always talked about what is not an option 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.689
 this is a bad version of what you can 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.119
 it put you give the initiative 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.820
 rival and opponent himself can decide 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.619
 probably your fate in this match in this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 fighting at least exactly how you lock 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 the rival carrier can do all that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 please you can only stand on two 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 three positions try to move 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.040
 I hope that you shouldn't 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.990
 light is some hope 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.660
 and the consolation of the team you know there somehow 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.790
 inside ourselves inside timspika we always 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.330
 we see that the tactics of the team that 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.080
 attacks 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.240
 it works very often if defense where 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.030
 you make a malish mistake you lose a tank 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 Essentially the same one loses although eat yes yes 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.270
 eat a huge amount of territory 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.979
 Opponent opponent engaged and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.930
 make them uncomfortable position for me 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.790
 that is, the panel is a slight pressure behind 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.620
 you are already working out the light from the flanks 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.690
 that you in fact can not in any way the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
 more map mines and on this base we 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.220
 constantly see that one of the teams 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.959
 prefers to play some 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.940
 defensive tactics trying 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.300
 lock yourself at your base and the other 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.450
 the team constantly goes on the attack and the team 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.410
 unity has a very serious experience at all 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.510
 games in 742 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.580
 not only on this map and they are like nobody 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 should know how these tactics break 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.739
 the more I remember the same match unity 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.810
 against the moment they themselves sat in the same 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.360
 protection in exactly the same protection sat 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.820
 unity team and they should know where u 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.160
 This tactic has weak points where you can 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.019
 break through and how can you act then 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.489
 these guys are just 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.840
 climbed on this crust for sure 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.910
 enemy home integral mayo 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.769
 the ship with the mountain and the very business is very 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.720
 effective stuff is a factor 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.570
 surprises you know and what the unity 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.850
 they themselves did not know that it was possible to climb it 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.200
 One of the options must have it here 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.790
 why the unity command made a mistake 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.100
 why could they not be the one to protect 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.959
 we continue the fight is written 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.820
 why not take a taxi why 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.380
 did not climb the mountain in any case 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.390
 here you can eat and devyasnoik 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.570
 mamba there and. pick up and three old 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.400
 plant crops give a drum and here it is 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.980
 at least some contact Achaeans saw 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 finally the 13th place in the center gave diode 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.000
 info about the fact that there is a bottom t1 and 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.120
 unity remains less and less 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.580
 less than 3 minutes 45 seconds before 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.070
 time when the timer will tell us only in 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.290
 one thing is that time is over for this 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.070
 card proceed to another countdown 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.130
 still 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.750
 10 if unity does not change anything here 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.790
 everything looks like unity is just not 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 going to do whether they have no days 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.049
 under it was ground may not think 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.940
 simple attack but those aggressive 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.590
 act means panic will 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.940
 somewhere here on the next card 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.099
 Here is the option from the object I do not understand 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.410
 unity in 2 look at the object and what it is 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:07.450
 doing this all the time that's what he does 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.280
 Cyc here it is exactly the object and that with this 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.709
 Shreds position of trying to make against 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.290
 saint who would be in defense even there 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.229
 T3 build and calmly disassemble the tower 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.449
 if it is t32 then it means its towers 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.609
 tank let's go clearance but this is an object 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.070
 he has a pretty good back tower 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.590
 precision stealth is all good 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.660
 okay but driving out on an opponent one in 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.460
 one and take into account the fact that the tower is not 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.729
 rotates around the body completely yes 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.979
 This is a noticeable cons of some 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.880
 1390 month you alone settled there 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.710
 near the stern or board can it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.600
 destroy and they do it very often 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.880
 what we see is the case with the object well here 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.190
 if resisted the beach will meet too 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.169
 wipe we build quietly in the tower 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.340
 more engine front projection of the sea 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.460
 engine in front that is it cannot 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.620
 catch fire that very often also happens 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.000
 on these tanks and here she is a team tactic 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.760
 unity will finally be revealed under 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.570
 end two 13 90 one year go through 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.700
 island at saint here only kennys can 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.139
 try to give a clearance as democritus 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.630
 now is a locked position not 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.910
 it is clear that he expects so he himself does not 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.860
 shine damage he give no one 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.680
 maybe he will wait and wait and go 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240
 team you have 0 1 so see lyceum 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.669

 Nadya fool got there understand that 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.729
 Those can not go along with Dima 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.340

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.039
 reduced when inspect the garden 69 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.780

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.919
 Irina is located 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.430

 so wrong why theodore is not 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.960
 covered up 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.090
 at unity are four tanks as well as 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.720
 and from whom they take anatolich 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:55.460
 approaching will be the protrusions of the goal and human 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:56.930
 cornea amiga no comment missing 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.810
 enough time to pick it up 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.760
 from the spectrum plus there is also a box on 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.120
 its 50100 which is simply put 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.220
 come to me because he has damage 0 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.080
 hitting and breaking damage it is nothing 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.479
 did gods for it and most importantly 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.490
 look he sat after being hacked back 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.710
 literally seconds 30 maybe 40 and 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.169
 the guys would be quiet in 4 3 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.300
