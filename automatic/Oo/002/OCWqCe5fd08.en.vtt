rocker switch and I'm assuming that this
is<00:04:17.780> our<00:04:18.739> power<00:04:19.630> one<00:04:20.630> second<00:04:20.989> yeah<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:21.410> just<00:04:21.620> a

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
is our power one second yeah so just a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.650 
is our power one second yeah so just a
little<00:04:21.859> theis<00:04:22.220> door<00:04:23.060> right<00:04:23.240> there<00:04:23.419> for<00:04:23.570> your

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
little theis door right there for your

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.740 
little theis door right there for your
power<00:04:24.460> keep<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.580> concealed<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.479> out<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
power keep it concealed and out of the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.810 
power keep it concealed and out of the
way

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
way

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.040
