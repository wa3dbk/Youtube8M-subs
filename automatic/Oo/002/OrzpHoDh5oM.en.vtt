00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.770 
out of this one we're going to discuss
this<00:01:55.260> side<00:01:55.530> cover<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:59.520> will<00:01:59.700> need<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.090> grind

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.940 

these<00:02:03.780> four<00:02:04.200> areas<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.990> room<00:02:07.260> with<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
these four areas to make room with a

these four areas to make room with a
button<00:02:08.310> heads<00:02:12.890> also<00:02:13.890> make<00:02:14.100> sure<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.430> have

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
button heads also make sure you have

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.790 
button heads also make sure you have
blue<00:02:14.880> loctite<00:02:17.570> my<00:02:18.570> stator<00:02:18.900> plate<00:02:19.110> kit<00:02:19.470> comes

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
blue loctite my stator plate kit comes

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.310 
blue loctite my stator plate kit comes
with<00:02:20.330> three<00:02:21.330> button<00:02:21.690> heads<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:23.160> plate<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
with three button heads the plate and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.830 
with three button heads the plate and
three<00:02:25.670> socket<00:02:26.670> heads<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> button<00:02:29.970> heads<00:02:30.180> will

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
three socket heads the button heads will

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.150 
three socket heads the button heads will
secure<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> cutout<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> plate<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.950> your

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
secure the cutout to the plate then your

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.910 
secure the cutout to the plate then your
stator<00:02:38.550> we're<00:02:39.270> bolt<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.380> side<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
stator we're bolt to this side of the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.650 
stator we're bolt to this side of the
cutout<00:02:41.780> using<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.470> socket<00:02:43.740> heads<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> your

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
cutout using the socket heads so your

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.390 
cutout using the socket heads so your
stator<00:02:45.990> will<00:02:46.380> be<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.800> with<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> socket

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
stator will be here with the socket

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.250 
stator will be here with the socket
heads

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.800 

and<00:02:52.830> make<00:02:53.069> sure<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.610> use<00:02:53.940> blue<00:02:54.930> loctite

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and make sure you use blue loctite

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.339 
and make sure you use blue loctite
on<00:02:57.810> all<00:02:58.019> bolts<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.390> now<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.080> cutout

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
on all bolts so now you have this cutout

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.940 
on all bolts so now you have this cutout
and<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.129> have<00:03:02.750> stator<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.110> side<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and you have stator on one side and the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.640 
and you have stator on one side and the
plate<00:03:05.220> on<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.610> other<00:03:05.760> side<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:07.230> you're<00:03:07.440> ready

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
plate on the other side now you're ready

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.619 
plate on the other side now you're ready
to<00:03:07.739> slide<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.310> back<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:12.330> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.540> be

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
to slide it back in and it's going to be

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.539 
to slide it back in and it's going to be
a<00:03:12.660> really<00:03:13.140> tight<00:03:13.470> fit<00:03:13.769> you're<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> want

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
a really tight fit you're going to want

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.970 
a really tight fit you're going to want
to<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:15.049> you're<00:03:16.049> ready<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.290> put<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:16.650> three

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
to put you're ready to put these three

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
to put you're ready to put these three
in<00:03:18.799> with<00:03:19.799> your<00:03:21.200> original<00:03:22.200> screws<00:03:23.269> now<00:03:24.269> this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
in with your original screws now this

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.789 
in with your original screws now this
isn't<00:03:24.629> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.900> fit<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.470> don't<00:03:25.650> have

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
isn't going to fit because I don't have

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.220 
isn't going to fit because I don't have
those<00:03:26.010> cut<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:27.019> but<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:29.099> will<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
those cut out but you will see that the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.390 
those cut out but you will see that the
holes<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.709> line<00:03:31.950> up<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.620> start<00:03:35.190> putting

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
holes do line up and you start putting
