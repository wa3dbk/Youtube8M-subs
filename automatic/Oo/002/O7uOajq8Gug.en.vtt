00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I'm running a program called touch OSC

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.880 
I'm running a program called touch OSC
that<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:14.360> connects<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.540> ipod<00:01:16.409> touch<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that just can connects my ipod touch to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
that just can connects my ipod touch to
the<00:01:16.979> computer<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.729> Wi-Fi<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.479> send<00:01:19.380> signals

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the computer over Wi-Fi and send signals

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.880 
the computer over Wi-Fi and send signals
using<00:01:19.950> open<00:01:20.340> sound<00:01:20.520> control<00:01:21.140> okay<00:01:22.140> um<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
using open sound control okay um it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.969 
using open sound control okay um it's
very<00:01:22.979> simple<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.850> I've<00:01:24.000> designed<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.979> took

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
very simple so I've designed this took

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.240 
very simple so I've designed this took
like<00:01:26.189> three<00:01:26.490> frets<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> guitar<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like three frets of a guitar and if you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
like three frets of a guitar and if you
push<00:01:29.540> they<00:01:30.540> respond<00:01:30.960> very<00:01:31.890> simply<00:01:32.220> um<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
push they respond very simply um so you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
push they respond very simply um so you
can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> play<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.420> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can see if I want to play something like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
can see if I want to play something like
a<00:01:36.600> C<00:01:36.840> chord<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.500> hold<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.950> fingers

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
a C chord you just hold down the fingers

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.510 
a C chord you just hold down the fingers
as<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> regular<00:01:39.240> guitar<00:01:40.520> bring

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
as you would on a regular guitar bring

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
as you would on a regular guitar bring
your<00:01:41.729> over<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> huge<00:01:42.990> pick<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.560> guess<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
your over the huge pick I guess and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.550 
your over the huge pick I guess and
strong

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.740 

and<00:01:48.560> all<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.040> actually<00:01:49.190> being<00:01:49.580> all<00:01:50.540> this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
and all this is actually being all this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.170 
and all this is actually being all this
is<00:01:50.870> generating<00:01:51.410> as<00:01:51.590> many<00:01:51.950> signals<00:01:52.370> because

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
is generating as many signals because

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.090 
is generating as many signals because
this<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.510> really<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.260> mini<00:01:54.530> instrument

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this is really just a mini instrument

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.320 
this is really just a mini instrument
and<00:01:55.460> I'm<00:01:55.580> actually<00:01:55.730> routing<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.300> through

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
and I'm actually routing it through

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.530 
and I'm actually routing it through

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
sending signals that's actually a pic

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
control object on the left you're gonna

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.930 
control object on the left you're gonna
see<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.110> heart<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.710> patch<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.340> it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
see the heart of this patch and it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.460 
see the heart of this patch and it's
very<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.480> not<00:02:26.750> very<00:02:26.990> compliment

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
very it's not very compliment

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.230 
very it's not very compliment
complicated<00:02:28.250> even<00:02:28.340> though<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.640> might<00:02:28.760> look<00:02:28.970> so

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
complicated even though it might look so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.220 
complicated even though it might look so
most<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.410> basic<00:02:30.800> algebra<00:02:31.960> so<00:02:32.960> all

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
most of it is just basic algebra so all

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.720 
most of it is just basic algebra so all
I<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.650> doing<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:33.950> sending<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.400> MIDI

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I have it doing is sending the MIDI

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
I have it doing is sending the MIDI
signals<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.420> if<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.570> take<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> look<00:02:36.020> at<00:02:36.200> those

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
signals and if you take a look at those

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.890 
signals and if you take a look at those
a<00:02:36.650> small<00:02:37.370> round<00:02:37.550> bang<00:02:37.910> object<00:02:38.480> those<00:02:38.630> small

it's going down each one of these each

that you'll see six strains six strings
five<00:02:52.370> strings<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.000> four<00:02:53.270> strings<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.860> is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
five strings and four strings this is

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.800 
five strings and four strings this is
due<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> fact<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:55.940> all<00:02:55.970> chords<00:02:56.600> use

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
due to the fact that not all chords use

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.960 
due to the fact that not all chords use
all<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.230> strings<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.400> based<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.790> which

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
all the strings and so based on which

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.020 
all the strings and so based on which
button<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.420> push<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.830> controls<00:03:01.280> how<00:03:01.580> many

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
button I push it controls how many

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.210 
button I push it controls how many
strings<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.390> play<00:03:02.630> but<00:03:03.380> on<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> far<00:03:03.830> right<00:03:04.070> you

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
strings I play but on the far right you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.120 
strings I play but on the far right you
see<00:03:04.430> roll<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.390> pitch<00:03:05.800> now<00:03:06.800> these<00:03:06.950> are<00:03:07.100> just

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
see roll and pitch now these are just

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.540 
see roll and pitch now these are just
parameters<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:07.940> Wiimote<00:03:08.360> um<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.800> remotes

ends to open sound control and so based

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.340 
ends to open sound control and so based
on<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.730> roll<00:03:13.910> in<00:03:14.120> base<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> pitch<00:03:14.870> I've

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
on the roll in base on the pitch I've

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.680 
on the roll in base on the pitch I've
created<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.100> very<00:03:16.310> simple<00:03:16.670> algorithm<00:03:16.940> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
created just a very simple algorithm to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.230 
created just a very simple algorithm to
mimic<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.740> how<00:03:19.130> someone<00:03:19.520> would<00:03:19.640> normally<00:03:20.060> play

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
mimic of how someone would normally play

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.510 
mimic of how someone would normally play
the<00:03:20.390> guitar<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.320> my<00:03:21.650> bottom<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.310> a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
the guitar and my bottom is just a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.000 
the guitar and my bottom is just a
sensitivity<00:03:23.090> measure<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.710> people<00:03:24.860> who

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
sensitivity measure so for people who

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.580 
sensitivity measure so for people who
tend<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.580> rotate<00:03:26.030> their<00:03:26.240> wrist<00:03:26.480> more<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:27.410> can

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
tend to rotate their wrist more you can

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.780 
tend to rotate their wrist more you can
increase<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.400> there

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
increase it there

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.180 
increase it there
increase<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.450> sensitivity<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.890> reverse

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
increase the sensitivity and the reverse

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.140 
increase the sensitivity and the reverse
is<00:03:31.340> true<00:03:31.490> as<00:03:31.640> well<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.370> hopefully<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
is true as well and so hopefully in the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.480 
is true as well and so hopefully in the
next<00:03:35.360> next<00:03:36.260> month<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.710> hope<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.310> actually

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
next next month I hope to actually

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.490 
next next month I hope to actually
develop<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.120> more<00:03:38.300> robust<00:03:38.810> version<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.350> this

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
develop a more robust version of this

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.230 
develop a more robust version of this
guitar<00:03:39.680> because<00:03:40.460> again<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> very

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
guitar because again this is a very

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.020 
guitar because again this is a very
simple<00:03:42.140> not<00:03:42.410> terribly<00:03:43.190> useful<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.700> terms<00:03:43.850> of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
simple not terribly useful in terms of

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.720 
simple not terribly useful in terms of
performance<00:03:44.630> version<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.230> guitar

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
performance version of the guitar

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.780 
performance version of the guitar
additionally<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.790> will<00:03:46.910> be<00:03:47.090> designing<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
additionally I will be designing the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.340 
additionally I will be designing the
redesigning<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.970> suppose<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.810> invisible

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
redesigning I suppose the invisible

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.190 
redesigning I suppose the invisible
violin<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:51.980> invisible<00:03:52.670> drums<00:03:52.940> for<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.630> few

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
violin and invisible drums for a few

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.770 
violin and invisible drums for a few
conferences<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.980> are<00:03:55.070> coming<00:03:55.340> soon<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:55.780> stay
