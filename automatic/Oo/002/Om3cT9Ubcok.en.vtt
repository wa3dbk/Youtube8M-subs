00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.900
 friends attraction 360 we are here in 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.279
 santa monica california driving east 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.810
 vehicle one of the beauties that the 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.259
 automotive industry have presented us 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.269
 recently the 8th of vw definitely 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.730
 one of the most innovative technologies 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.920
 not only because of what it represents to the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.990
 sportiness and efficiency but by the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.759
 fusion of both concepts on the one hand 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.470
 we have an electric motor that you 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.960
 allows to have a range of autonomy 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.249
 extended but not only this but also 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.919
 the power of a three engine 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.530
 cylinders 1.5 liters turbocharged that in 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.390
 together they give us more than 362 horses 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.670
 force the issue with this vehicle is not 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.410
 just driving not only the DNA to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.690
 which pain has us accustomed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.180
 but also the combination how is that 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.250
 these two cars can coexist in a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.630
 same it would be said that there are several cars in 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.790
 one today we had the opportunity to 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.400
 Drive several modes of operation mode 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.340
 comfort the mode with the sport mode that is 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
 the most aggressive and where you find 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.190
 definitely all benefits to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.930
 which we are used to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.610
 bermeo the low however also another 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.380
 kind of details that called us a lot 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.449
 attention for example the way in the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.040
 that is able to combine the attraction 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.250
 that can be front can be 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.260
 opposite back 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.120
 and the response of this car when you 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.940
 think the accelerator is definitely 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.950
 that of a catapult is a car to which 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.500
 in some way the model has put 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.540
 all the little details to which 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 he had already been used to others 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.100
 autos divisions as m are present 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.350
 in this car but also the efficiency 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.600
 if you can not see the design of this 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.010
 vehicle has an aerodynamic that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.869
 It helps a lot to make it a car more 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.729
 efficient more friendly with the medium 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.770
 environment and that's where we do not find 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.840
 a direct rival in the food we are 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.700
 talking to the managers of vm wy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.710
 they told us that at the moment 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.320
 they have a rival to make a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.940
 front or a referent they of some 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.259
 have taken great care of the consumption of 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.149
 fuel also efficiency 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.890
 energetic but also driving 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.300
 it is comfortable to be that of a 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.970
 hybrid vehicle that allows you to have 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.950
 this extended range of up to 600 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.220
 kilometers of autonomy when you have 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 a larger fuel tank or 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 440 more or less in a tank 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.470
 conventional but at the same time you have 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.500
 37 kilometers in which you can go 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.110
 up to 120 kilometers per hour only 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.490
 with the electric motor the regeneration 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.410
 of energy in the descents 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.450
 braking is something important that also 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.920
 allows you to take better advantage of the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 average fuel we have a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 discussion about what is better 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.890
 connect connect the car to the socket 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 ccoo to the outlet of your house or 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.580
 pour gasoline in this case here in 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 the united states and there in states and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.840
 in Mexico it would also be better to connect 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.520
 the car because electricity is a lot 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.970
 cheaper and yet good is your 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.250
 choice 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.990
 here we have this and 8 of which we will be 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.730
 talking about all these days 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.530
 because soon it will also reach 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.090
 our country here in mexico are here in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.220
 us sorry are 137 35,700 dollars 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.080
 that you have to pay for this beauty but 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.440
 soon our country will be many 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.440
 Thank you
