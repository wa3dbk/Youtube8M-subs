have more guns than I do and I'm just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
have more guns than I do and I'm just
stuck<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.500> three<00:00:37.770> default<00:00:38.040> classes<00:00:38.670> so

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
stuck with the three default classes so

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
stuck with the three default classes so
how<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.450> manage<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.469> well<00:00:40.649> as

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
how do I manage to do just as well as

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.030 
how do I manage to do just as well as
those<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.300> level<00:00:42.300> 50<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.860> game

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
those at level 50 well this game

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
those at level 50 well this game
basically<00:00:44.579> comes<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> fact<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
basically comes down to the fact that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
basically comes down to the fact that
some<00:00:46.140> perks<00:00:46.649> aren't<00:00:47.420> hugely<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.950> you're

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
some perks aren't hugely you know you're

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.430 
some perks aren't hugely you know you're
not<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.420> any<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.719> perk<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
not there's not any one perk that is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
not there's not any one perk that is
best<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> every<00:00:53.070> single<00:00:53.190> situation<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
best in every single situation and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
best in every single situation and
what's<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> basically<00:00:55.110> means<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
what's that what I basically means is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
what's that what I basically means is
each<00:00:55.890> perk<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.460> situational<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
each perk is situational in there if you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
each perk is situational in there if you
think<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.100> let's<00:00:59.309> think

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
think about it and it's let's think

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
think about it and it's let's think
could<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.480> green<00:01:00.690> classes<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> third

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
could be the green classes or the third

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.050 
could be the green classes or the third
classes<00:01:03.049> third<00:01:04.049> um<00:01:04.290> perks<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.400> there's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
classes third um perks way there's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
classes third um perks way there's
tactical<00:01:06.510> mask<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> rush<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
tactical mask now to get a rush that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
tactical mask now to get a rush that
could<00:01:08.460> affect<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> end<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
could affect you a bit but the end of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.640 
could affect you a bit but the end of
the<00:01:09.659> day<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.080> always<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the day you're not always going to be

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
the day you're not always going to be
running<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> let<00:01:11.159> enemy<00:01:12.090> Nova<00:01:12.930> gas<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.320> whatnot

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
running to let enemy Nova gas or whatnot

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.840 
running to let enemy Nova gas or whatnot
so<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.369> always<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so that's not always going to be

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
so that's not always going to be
effective<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> may<00:01:15.869> always<00:01:16.049> work<00:01:16.350> there's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
effective or it may always work there's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
effective or it may always work there's
math<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
math and now you're going to be a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
math and now you're going to be a
defensive<00:01:18.750> plane<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.259> gonna<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.439> running

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
defensive plane or is gonna be running

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
defensive plane or is gonna be running
so<00:01:19.890> again<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.520> ways<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.880> take

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so again that's not ways gonna take

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.899 
so again that's not ways gonna take
effect<00:01:21.530> ninja<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.520> having<00:01:23.759> a

that's<00:04:40.419> not<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.780> most<00:04:40.900> effectively<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.530> a

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
that's not the most effectively and a

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.950 
that's not the most effectively and a
close<00:04:42.160> Raylan<00:04:42.610> it's<00:04:43.030> very<00:04:43.270> hard<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.630> get<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.750> one

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
close Raylan it's very hard to get a one

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.780 
close Raylan it's very hard to get a one
burst<00:04:44.200> kill<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.040> I'd<00:04:45.130> watch<00:04:45.340> out<00:04:45.550> with

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
burst kill so I'd watch out with

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.920 
burst kill so I'd watch out with
close-range<00:04:46.150> combat<00:04:46.240> if<00:04:46.720> you're<00:04:46.810> using

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
close-range combat if you're using

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.950 
close-range combat if you're using
default<00:04:47.260> layout<00:04:47.830> then<00:04:48.600> reaction<00:04:49.600> knifing

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
default layout then reaction knifing

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.690 
default layout then reaction knifing
with<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.169> m16<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:50.710> very<00:04:50.950> useful<00:04:51.400> because<00:04:51.520> the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
with the m16 is very useful because the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.760 
with the m16 is very useful because the
m16<00:04:52.180> really<00:04:52.600> isn't<00:04:52.720> very<00:04:52.840> effective<00:04:53.200> up<00:04:53.470> close

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
m16 really isn't very effective up close

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.310 
m16 really isn't very effective up close
and<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.090> say<00:04:55.360> try<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.750> keep<00:04:55.810> your<00:04:55.930> gun<00:04:56.080> right

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
and so I say try and keep your gun right

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.050 
and so I say try and keep your gun right
there<00:04:56.350> gunfights<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.160> mid<00:04:57.340> range<00:04:57.610> which<00:04:57.880> means

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
there gunfights to mid range which means

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.200 
there gunfights to mid range which means
and<00:04:58.510> basically<00:04:59.470> taking<00:05:00.310> corners<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:00.880> using

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
and basically taking corners and using

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.030 
and basically taking corners and using
cover<00:05:01.479> where<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.380> can<00:05:02.560> get<00:05:02.650> into<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.889> position

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
cover where you can get into a position

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.170 
cover where you can get into a position
where<00:05:03.370> you're<00:05:03.460> going<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.669> be<00:05:03.729> shooting<00:05:03.910> the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
where you're going to be shooting the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.909 
where you're going to be shooting the
enemy<00:05:04.270> at<00:05:04.510> mid<00:05:04.690> range<00:05:05.020> which<00:05:05.560> means<00:05:05.710> you're

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
enemy at mid range which means you're

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.260 
enemy at mid range which means you're
going<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.070> have<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.460> some<00:05:06.669> sort<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.090> them

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
going to have to have some sort of them

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.830 
going to have to have some sort of them
idea<00:05:07.630> about<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.900> enemy<00:05:08.169> spawns<00:05:08.470> HK<00:05:09.190> 21<00:05:09.840> I'm

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
idea about the enemy spawns HK 21 I'm

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.420 
idea about the enemy spawns HK 21 I'm
just<00:05:10.990> gonna<00:05:11.080> check<00:05:11.440> quickly<00:05:11.650> now<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.160> can't

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
just gonna check quickly now I can't

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.280 
just gonna check quickly now I can't
shake<00:05:12.550> him<00:05:12.639> afraid<00:05:12.820> but<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.210> believe<00:05:13.630> is<00:05:13.720> he<00:05:13.780> 21

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
shake him afraid but I believe is he 21

then bang upper one to two bullets train
from<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.630> hip<00:05:22.780> he's<00:05:22.930> not<00:05:23.080> firing<00:05:23.320> from<00:05:23.440> the

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
from the hip he's not firing from the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.560 
from the hip he's not firing from the
hip<00:05:23.590> with<00:05:23.830> if<00:05:23.919> you<00:05:24.010> thought<00:05:24.270> that's<00:05:25.270> why<00:05:25.450> we'd

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
hip with if you thought that's why we'd

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.520 
hip with if you thought that's why we'd
ever<00:05:25.630> do<00:05:25.780> drugs<00:05:25.870> me<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:27.040> win<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.110> HK
