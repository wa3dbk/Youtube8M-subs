00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
and it actually came with

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.520

constructor<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.660> I'll<00:04:18.750> use<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.079> two<00:04:19.260> minute

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
constructor so I'll use the two minute

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.920 
constructor so I'll use the two minute
and<00:04:19.799> then<00:04:20.190> I'll<00:04:20.310> put<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.930> balancing
