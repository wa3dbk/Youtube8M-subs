00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.369
 MV Agusta gives gas on the race track 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.380
 from misano presented the italians 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.039
 with the f 3 800 her second 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.059
 three-cylinder athlete after the f3 675 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.529
 So now the f3 with 800 cubic centimeters 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.930
 like her younger sister 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.849
 one egg also owns the other 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.770
 ride by wire eight-stage 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.039
 traction control and three different ones 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.039
 driving modes 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.690
 but above all, the same ingenious 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.640
 Suspension only the spring elements 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.420
 something on the more power 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.510
 customized 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.880
 because during the 675 he two in the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.220
 but supersport region fits in as well 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.860
 a very high performance 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.280
 should own the 800s evenly 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 administered 148 ps and so 20 horses 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 own more 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.660
 in the medium speed range speaks mv 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.310
 even up to 30 more ps and that at 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.950
 unchanged low dry weight of 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.150
 173 kilograms 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.290
 well if that non-aqueous her mouth 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.640
 actually made that manifest 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.020
 Chassis after the soft 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 basic setting of the spring leg in 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.880
 The direction was trimmed in misano 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.890
 in a great mood 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.700
 paired with impeccable neutrality and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 precision 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 so were the many tricky 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.869
 curves in the nebulized the stability 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.430
 in a sloping position is always better 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.229
 the technicians seem to vote 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 the electronic throttle handle 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.500
 to get 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.290
 especially in normal mode, the f3 goes 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.270
 gentle but not sluggish ansgars athletic 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.400
 directly sometimes a bit abrupt though 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.430
 still acceptable in the gas intake 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.260
 sport mode marched evenly 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.110
 Drilling through the speed band sounds 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.880
 voluminous and full only at 7000 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.979
 turns it behaves a bit restrained and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 subjectively not after 30 more ps 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.229
 opposite the 675 yet as soon as the 8000s 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.760
 mark is exceeded sees the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.520
 three cylinder with pressure until the 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.350
 Limiter by doing this, the MV on 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 curve exit but also ever 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.280
 vigorously with the handlebar twitch 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.660
 Steering damper should be at least many 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.730
 Racetrack necessarily 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.799
 but not the be found on bike 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.070
 but only in the mv own accessories 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.260
 catalog the engines of 675 around 800 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.360
 were developed and are simultaneously 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.180
 thus identical up to the cylinder head 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.739
 with its titanium valves only one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.860
 Crankshaft with more high and something 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.230
 other pistons and 15% throughput 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.260
 happy injection nozzles provide for that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.579
 plus in capacity and performance 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 In addition, the 800 was still one 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.490
 perfectly working anti hopping 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.960
 clutch donated 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.180
 in cooperation with the new ones 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.070
 class tuned brembo monoblock 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.950
 brakes for convincing braking 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.420
 performance ensures the f3 800 possesses 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.360
 a traction control the still without 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.440
 Balance the bike path works 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.210
 improved and retuned 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.400
 prevents them slide reliable 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.710
 but does not work so perfect and yet 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.140
 sensitive as more expensive systems like 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.060
 they are from bmw ducati aprilia or 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.670
 kawasaki is the mv's 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.010
 not only stunningly beautiful her concept that 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
 handling a 600 with more power and 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.420
 namely to combine torque makes 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.720
 with fun and also to superbike 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.720
 fright
