port it's kind of a little awkward to
get<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.070> phone<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.550> at<00:02:21.150> least<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.510> my<00:02:21.540> phone<00:02:21.960> my

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
get the phone in at least on my phone my

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.950 
get the phone in at least on my phone my
husband's<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.160> at<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
husband's is not at all and then the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.800 
husband's is not at all and then the
screen<00:02:25.140> capture<00:02:25.970> was<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.270> weird<00:02:29.810> but

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
screen capture was kind of weird but

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
screen capture was kind of weird but
other<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.930> phone<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
other than that I think the phone is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.210 
other than that I think the phone is
doing<00:02:34.440> really<00:02:34.560> good<00:02:34.800> if<00:02:34.920> there's<00:02:35.070> something
