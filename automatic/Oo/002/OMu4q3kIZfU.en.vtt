we can talk about that traditional

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.779 
we can talk about that traditional
design<00:00:26.650> a<00:00:26.679> bit<00:00:26.829> later<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:27.249> go<00:00:27.369> through<00:00:27.519> some<00:00:27.699> of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
design a bit later to go through some of

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.259 
design a bit later to go through some of
the<00:00:27.849> features<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:29.849> concept<00:00:30.849> behind<00:00:30.970> the

dream smock is that you'd wear this all

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.190 
dream smock is that you'd wear this all
day<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.730> it<00:00:34.090> then<00:00:34.239> has<00:00:34.450> features<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.110> they

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
day and it then has features and they

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.990 
day and it then has features and they
will<00:00:35.380> you<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.800> fine-tune<00:00:36.129> it<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.820> amount

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
will you to fine-tune it to the amount

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.360 
will you to fine-tune it to the amount
of<00:00:37.090> insulation<00:00:37.629> you<00:00:37.750> require<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:39.010> on<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
of insulation you require so on the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.580 
of insulation you require so on the
sides<00:00:39.609> here<00:00:39.940> there<00:00:40.539> are<00:00:40.629> two<00:00:40.840> zips<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.410> both

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
sides here there are two zips that both

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.799 
sides here there are two zips that both
open<00:00:42.039> up<00:00:42.129> into<00:00:42.370> meshed<00:00:42.609> areas<00:00:43.120> on<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.420> inside

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
open up into meshed areas on the inside

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.919 
open up into meshed areas on the inside
then<00:00:44.769> also<00:00:44.949> these<00:00:45.309> zips<00:00:45.609> lower<00:00:46.090> down<00:00:46.300> here<00:00:46.660> can

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
then also these zips lower down here can

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.319 
then also these zips lower down here can
be<00:00:47.050> opened<00:00:47.469> from<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.679> top<00:00:47.949> downwards<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:49.120> with

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
be opened from the top downwards so with

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.419 
be opened from the top downwards so with
this<00:00:49.449> open<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:50.140> this<00:00:50.289> open<00:00:50.769> when<00:00:51.339> you're

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
this open and this open when you're

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.819 
this open and this open when you're
actually<00:00:51.609> active<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.390> very<00:00:52.570> warm<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:53.620> can

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
actually active and very warm you can

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.560 
actually active and very warm you can
reduce<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.670> amount<00:00:54.789> of<00:00:54.940> insulation<00:00:55.239> quite

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
reduce the amount of insulation quite

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.180 
reduce the amount of insulation quite
considerably<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.649> then<00:00:56.769> when<00:00:56.859> you<00:00:56.949> become

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
considerably and then when you become

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.950 
considerably and then when you become
stationary<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:58.239> need<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.539> make<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.719> jacket

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
stationary you need to make a jacket

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.270 
stationary you need to make a jacket
warmer<00:00:59.469> then<00:00:59.859> you<00:00:59.980> do<00:01:00.309> both<00:01:00.550> these<00:01:00.820> zips<00:01:01.089> up<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
warmer then you do both these zips up to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.390 
warmer then you do both these zips up to
respond<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.820> change<00:01:04.059> conditions<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
respond to the change conditions the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.070 
respond to the change conditions the
side<00:01:06.670> pockets<00:01:07.150> are<00:01:07.390> what<00:01:07.840> are<00:01:07.930> called

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
side pockets are what are called

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.560 
side pockets are what are called
