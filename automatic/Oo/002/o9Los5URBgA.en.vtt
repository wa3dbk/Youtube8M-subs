 new sales to envy for another game 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.660
 of preparation is that the moment always 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.910
 of the national anthem 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 Portuguese young people are 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 are certainly still more motivated 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.760
 to perform a good display and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.400

 the Polish team had 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.680
 makes the international 10 very cold 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.680
 polish in this bid 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 eight minutes later, José would 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.869
 make equality in the marker in play 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.630
 right side of the Portuguese attack and the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.350
 advanced to achieve the spearhead 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.610

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.119
 important in the game on Tuesday because 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 it was from a ladder that left the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.959
 penalty that would come the cake is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.690

 in portugal gonçalo guedes on a free 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.700
