you've<00:01:46.630> got<00:01:46.780> extreme<00:01:47.080> conditioning<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:48.220> make

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
you've got extreme conditioning to make

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.039 
you've got extreme conditioning to make
you<00:01:48.850> run<00:01:49.000> up<00:01:49.180> there<00:01:49.360> as<00:01:49.450> fast<00:01:49.600> as<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:50.020> you

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
you run up there as fast as you can you

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.420 
you run up there as fast as you can you
got<00:01:50.290> quick-draw<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> recover<00:01:51.159> from<00:01:51.340> your

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
got quick-draw to recover from your

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.870 
got quick-draw to recover from your
sprint<00:01:51.820> much<00:01:52.659> quicker<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.890> dead<00:01:54.159> silence<00:01:54.340> so

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
sprint much quicker and dead silence so

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.280 
sprint much quicker and dead silence so
if<00:01:54.909> you're<00:01:55.090> kind<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.720> like<00:01:55.869> say<00:01:56.140> you're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
if you're kind of like say you're

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.390 
if you're kind of like say you're
running<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.590> corridor<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.280> there's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
running on corridor and there's

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.289 
running on corridor and there's
something<00:01:57.670> right<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> other<00:01:58.030> side<00:01:58.210> of

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
something right on the other side of

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.640 
something right on the other side of
that<00:01:58.390> wall<00:01:58.630> they're<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.290> gonna<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.470> able<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
that wall they're not gonna be able to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.170 
that wall they're not gonna be able to
hear<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.830> come<00:02:00.009> see<00:02:00.250> you're<00:02:00.759> gonna<00:02:00.880> get<00:02:01.030> like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
hear you come see you're gonna get like

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.600 
hear you come see you're gonna get like
a<00:02:01.210> really<00:02:01.600> really<00:02:01.720> nice<00:02:01.930> flank<00:02:02.290> on<00:02:02.439> them<00:02:02.610> if

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
a really really nice flank on them if

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.969 
a really really nice flank on them if
you're<00:02:04.540> more<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.350> run<00:02:05.560> right<00:02:05.680> up<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.799> middle

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
you're more of a run right up the middle

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.660 
you're more of a run right up the middle
I<00:02:06.310> would<00:02:06.790> probably<00:02:07.060> recommend<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.540> shotgun

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I would probably recommend the shotgun

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.800 
I would probably recommend the shotgun
SMG<00:02:09.670> either<00:02:09.970> one<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.269> really<00:02:10.390> can't<00:02:10.659> go<00:02:10.780> wrong

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
SMG either one you really can't go wrong

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.050 
SMG either one you really can't go wrong
for<00:02:11.349> any<00:02:11.560> style<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.980> running<00:02:12.129> gun<00:02:12.370> class<00:02:12.639> where

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
for any style of running gun class where

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.909 
for any style of running gun class where
you<00:02:13.419> know<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.689> gonna<00:02:13.779> get<00:02:13.989> right<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.829> in

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:14.919 
you know you're gonna get right up in

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.170 
you know you're gonna get right up in
the<00:02:15.010> sick<00:02:15.219> of<00:02:15.249> it<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.669> you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the sick of it and you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.339 
the sick of it and you
to<00:02:16.239> be<00:02:16.359> as<00:02:16.540> close<00:02:16.719> to<00:02:16.780> these<00:02:17.019> people<00:02:17.260> as

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
to be as close to these people as

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.610 
to be as close to these people as
possible<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:19.180> Perks<00:02:19.540> again<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.409> would

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
possible for Perks again I would

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.550 
possible for Perks again I would
probably<00:02:20.920> stick<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:22.049> extreme<00:02:23.049> conditioning

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
probably stick with extreme conditioning

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.319 
probably stick with extreme conditioning
or<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:24.099> could<00:02:24.280> go<00:02:24.430> with<00:02:24.549> side<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.790> hand<00:02:25.090> you

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
or you could go with side a hand you

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.759 
or you could go with side a hand you
know<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.540> more<00:02:25.629> Losey<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:26.349> you're<00:02:26.530> gonna<00:02:26.620> run

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
know it's more Losey if you're gonna run

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.080 
know it's more Losey if you're gonna run
up<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.069> middle<00:02:27.159> maybe<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.549> do<00:02:27.670> one<00:02:27.849> slide

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
up the middle maybe you do one slide

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.580 
up the middle maybe you do one slide
hand<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.780> moment<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.140> come<00:02:29.349> out<00:02:29.560> of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
hand so that the moment you come out of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.459 
hand so that the moment you come out of
or<00:02:30.099> if<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.579> have<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.879> stop<00:02:31.209> instantly<00:02:31.840> from

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
or if you have to stop instantly from

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.920 
or if you have to stop instantly from
your<00:02:32.650> sprint<00:02:33.239> aim-down-sights<00:02:34.239> much<00:02:34.420> faster

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
your sprint aim-down-sights much faster

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.509 
your sprint aim-down-sights much faster
and<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.650> half<00:02:35.829> second<00:02:36.189> advantage

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
and you get that half second advantage

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.750 
and you get that half second advantage
over<00:02:36.609> other<00:02:36.819> people<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:38.519> probably<00:02:39.519> also

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
over other people I probably also

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.729 
over other people I probably also
recommend<00:02:40.269> using<00:02:40.659> assassin

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
recommend using assassin

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.369 
recommend using assassin
so<00:02:42.069> now<00:02:42.939> if<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> assassin<00:02:43.719> pro<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.079> don't<00:02:44.260> get

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
so now if you assassin pro you don't get

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.399 
so now if you assassin pro you don't get
read<00:02:44.950> name<00:02:45.159> or<00:02:45.370> read<00:02:45.609> crosshair<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.239> your<00:02:46.409> on

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
read name or read crosshair of your on

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.250 
read name or read crosshair of your on
your<00:02:48.010> body<00:02:48.280> when<00:02:48.519> enemies<00:02:49.030> look<00:02:49.419> at<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.629> so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
your body when enemies look at you so

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.690 
your body when enemies look at you so
you<00:02:50.290> they<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:50.950> split-second

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
you they have that split-second

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
you they have that split-second
hesitancy<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.269> as<00:02:52.419> an<00:02:52.689> enemy<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.169> not

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
hesitancy like as an enemy I'm not

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.839 
hesitancy like as an enemy I'm not
entirely<00:02:53.560> sure<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.579> beginning<00:02:54.760> of

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
entirely sure what in the beginning of

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.460 
entirely sure what in the beginning of
the<00:02:54.909> game<00:02:55.030> now<00:02:55.419> obviously<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:56.019> you're

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the game now obviously gonna know you're

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.759 
the game now obviously gonna know you're
an<00:02:56.560> enemy<00:02:56.680> because<00:02:57.269> you're<00:02:58.500> there's<00:02:59.500> no<00:02:59.650> way

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
an enemy because you're there's no way

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.720 
an enemy because you're there's no way
about<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.099> but<00:03:00.189> you<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.400> couple<00:03:00.579> minutes

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
about it but you know a couple minutes

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.610 
about it but you know a couple minutes
into<00:03:00.939> the<00:03:01.030> game<00:03:01.060> they<00:03:02.019> got<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.290> stop<00:03:02.439> and<00:03:02.560> think

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
into the game they got to stop and think

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.899 
into the game they got to stop and think
like<00:03:02.889> okay<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.159> could<00:03:03.370> potentially<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.879> a

and<00:04:58.920> work<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.250> flank<00:04:59.580> as<00:04:59.790> well<00:05:00.000> especially

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
and work that flank as well especially

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.480 
and work that flank as well especially
working<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.200> outside<00:05:01.560> edges<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.070> map

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
working the outside edges in the map

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.130 
working the outside edges in the map
so<00:05:03.000> what's<00:05:03.180> sitrep<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.600> know<00:05:03.690> obviously

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
so what's sitrep you know obviously

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.390 
so what's sitrep you know obviously
you'd<00:05:04.290> be<00:05:04.380> able<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> claymores<00:05:05.220> and

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
you'd be able to see the claymores and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.010 
you'd be able to see the claymores and
whatnot<00:05:05.640> so<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:05.970> don't<00:05:06.390> walk<00:05:06.570> right<00:05:06.810> into<00:05:06.960> a

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
whatnot so you don't walk right into a

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.140 
whatnot so you don't walk right into a
booby<00:05:07.320> trap<00:05:07.350> like<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.800> always<00:05:07.980> do<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:09.120> then

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
booby trap like I always do and then

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.660 
booby trap like I always do and then
marksman<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:10.470> allows<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.950> to<00:05:10.980> see<00:05:11.250> enemy's

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
marksman it allows you to see enemy's

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.820 
marksman it allows you to see enemy's
names<00:05:12.000> pop<00:05:12.300> up<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.690> know<00:05:12.780> as<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.080> red<00:05:13.290> from<00:05:13.740> a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
names pop up you know as the red from a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.260 
names pop up you know as the red from a
much<00:05:13.980> farther<00:05:14.280> distance<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:14.940> normally

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
much farther distance and you normally

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.020 
much farther distance and you normally
would<00:05:15.390> without<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.950> that's<00:05:17.160> definitely<00:05:17.730> a

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
would without it so that's definitely a
