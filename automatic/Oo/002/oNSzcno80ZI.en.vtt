 - We congratulate you on silver medals. What are your impressions of this World Cup? 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 - It really was a very good World Championship. We prepared a lot for him. When we came here - we were actually amazed by the hall and the number of spectators - it was full. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Three thousand spectators watched and shouted along with the music and it was very loud! There was a warm atmosphere. So we felt very good. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 In fact, everyone will feel good if they support him like us. And everything went as we planned. Annette: Yes. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 - I want to ask about your choreography and tango dance. Who creates a variation for you? 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 - This is a mix, some bundles, of course, from our teachers William Pinot and Alessandra Bucharelli, we change some things ourselves. I think this is the best option. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 We made a new beginning, in fact, we discovered it two, even three days ago. We took this idea from our teacher Alessandra Bucharelli, who simply reminded us why not to insert something from our show. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And we thought about it. Why not? and we will do it in the final round. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 - Do you mean some jumping and slipping in tango? 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 - Yes. She loves jumping, which we usually do in our show, and asked why we should not put it in. Of course, we jump not as high as during the show. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 We still do it in such a way that it is still competitive in the tournament. She likes it and we did it four times. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 - You are not afraid that young dancers will try to do the same and it will look funny to them? 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 - Of course, we did not jump so high, it was not the goal. And we would not want young dancers to see exactly that. Annette: That's right. We would just like to show that it is possible to do something else, but we still adhere to the norms. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 It seems to me that it is very important to maintain the character of the dance. We try to do not just jumps and slides, but also to show their rhythm. One time they may be less, another time - to increase, and so each time with some changes. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.500
 Today it is still difficult to find a pair that does not add shows. And of course we have to be careful, we have a certain responsibility of the top couple - to guide the younger generation in the right direction. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.500
 And I hope that this was acceptable and very good, and that everyone enjoyed it. And we enjoyed it. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 - What do you think, which of your dances was the best today? 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 - In fact, I can not say. Everyone was pretty good, more or less. In any case, I like the foxtrot, which has become one of our most powerful dances. Quickstep was very good, although he is not our favorite, but our teachers said so. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:15.000
 - We are now in Kiev, in Ukraine. And this is not your first visit to this country. Have you tried any Ukrainian dishes? Maybe borscht, lard, something else? 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 - I do not know whether this is only a Ukrainian dish or a Russian one too. But today we tried pancakes with sour cream and caviar, and we really liked them. 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 I also tried Italian cuisine in Ukraine, and it was pretty good. Very good food. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.000
 - When will your wedding? We know that something in your life will change soon. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:55.000
 - I will try to postpone as much as I can. This is a very big step that has ever been in our life. Yes Yes. First of all, we want to complement and concentrate on our dance. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 We got engaged, we have been together for nine years and this is a very long time. Deadline - this will happen in early 2015. 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500
 - We wish you all the best. Thank you very much! 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000
 - Thank!
