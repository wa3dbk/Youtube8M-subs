00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.770 
forces up there in seven alpha and alpha
eventually<00:01:52.410> we<00:01:52.980> will<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.730> deployment<00:01:54.450> for

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
eventually we will make a deployment for

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.290 
eventually we will make a deployment for
the<00:01:54.840> second<00:01:55.260> point<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.430> looks<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.120> we're

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
the second point if it looks like we're

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.730 
the second point if it looks like we're
going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.600> able<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.850> which<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> nova<00:02:00.330> sod

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
going to be able to which is a nova sod

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.010 
going to be able to which is a nova sod
by<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.760> three<00:02:03.240> bridges<00:02:03.510> will<00:02:03.840> have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
by that time all three bridges will have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.859 
by that time all three bridges will have
been<00:02:04.170> occupied<00:02:04.470> by<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> enemy<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.940> fast<00:02:06.510> camp

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
been occupied by the enemy in fast camp

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.150 
been occupied by the enemy in fast camp
so<00:02:07.410> we're<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:07.890> able<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.070> use

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
so we're not going to be able to use

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
so we're not going to be able to use
those<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.820> look<00:02:09.030> above<00:02:09.630> Novus<00:02:10.320> sad<00:02:10.679> the

those if you look above Novus sad the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.170 
ultimately I believe that we're only
going<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:13.990> able<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.220> rescue<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.459> forces<00:04:15.940> up

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
going to be able to rescue the forces up

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.560 
going to be able to rescue the forces up
in<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.510> area<00:04:16.660> 42<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> north<00:04:18.390> it'll<00:04:19.390> be<00:04:19.540> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
in the area 42 to the north it'll be a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.080 
in the area 42 to the north it'll be a
miracle<00:04:19.810> if<00:04:20.140> we<00:04:20.200> even<00:04:20.530> attack<00:04:20.950> 41<00:04:21.549> that's<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
miracle if we even attack 41 that's the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.830 
miracle if we even attack 41 that's the
plan<00:04:22.210> right<00:04:22.330> now<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.290> force<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.650> be<00:04:23.770> out

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
plan right now is the force to be out

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.420 
plan right now is the force to be out
and<00:04:25.840> again<00:04:26.140> high-priority<00:04:27.040> US<00:04:27.640> base<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and again high-priority US base if the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.260 
and again high-priority US base if the
quarter<00:04:30.430> comes<00:04:30.640> down<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.060> it's<00:04:31.150> being

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
quarter comes down and it's being

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.590 
quarter comes down and it's being
attacked<00:04:31.630> we're<00:04:31.930> falling<00:04:32.320> back<00:04:33.300> do<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.480> as

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
attacked we're falling back do that as

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.580 
attacked we're falling back do that as
quick<00:04:34.780> as<00:04:34.870> we<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.580> understood
