wins the round robin then essentially

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.010 
wins the round robin then essentially
are<00:00:34.530> our<00:00:34.770> leaders<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.399> wiped<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.180> we'll

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
are our leaders was wiped out so we'll

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
are our leaders was wiped out so we'll
try<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.200> win<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:38.300> there's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> long<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> go

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
try and win it there's a long way to go

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
try and win it there's a long way to go
we've<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.649> races<00:00:40.800> he's<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.700> four

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
we've got two more races he's got four

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
we've got two more races he's got four
and<00:00:42.300> Phil<00:00:42.840> Robertson's<00:00:43.320> also<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> mix<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and Phil Robertson's also in the mix to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
and Phil Robertson's also in the mix to
win<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> round<00:00:44.789> robin<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.270> well<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.710> think

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
win the round robin as well so I think

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
win the round robin as well so I think
we<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:48.239> things<00:00:48.480> shape<00:00:48.719> up

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
we just have to see how things shape up

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.709 
we just have to see how things shape up
and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.469> shakeout<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.239> yeah<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and I think shakeout and yeah what the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.910 
and I think shakeout and yeah what the
picks<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> quarterfinals<00:00:52.800> come

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
picks are when the quarterfinals come

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
picks are when the quarterfinals come
round<00:00:53.070> he's<00:00:53.550> gonna<00:00:53.699> try<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> avoid<00:00:54.180> us<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.660> all

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
round he's gonna try to avoid us at all

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
round he's gonna try to avoid us at all
costs<00:00:55.170> anyways<00:00:55.469> cuz<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.100> he<00:00:56.280> might<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
costs anyways cuz I think he might be a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
costs anyways cuz I think he might be a
little<00:00:56.850> bit<00:00:57.030> afraid<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> us<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.780> whether<00:00:58.350> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
little bit afraid of us but whether we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
little bit afraid of us but whether we
race<00:00:58.710> him<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.129> we're<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.609> keep

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
race him or not we're just gonna keep

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.580 
race him or not we're just gonna keep
keep<00:01:00.270> fighting<00:01:00.570> hard<00:01:00.719> till<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> end<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
keep fighting hard till the end and you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
keep fighting hard till the end and you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Williams in a bit of trouble windward

Williams in a bit of trouble windward
boat<00:01:23.700> Willie<00:01:29.960> Williams<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.259> trying<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> get

through<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> tack<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:32.909> gonna<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> split

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
through the tack we're gonna see a split

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.149 
through the tack we're gonna see a split
tack<00:01:33.780> star<00:01:34.079> Taylor<00:01:34.439> Canfield<00:01:34.860> off<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
tack star Taylor Canfield off to the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
tack star Taylor Canfield off to the

left-hand side Williams off towards the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
left-hand side Williams off towards the
boat<00:01:38.180> come<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
boat come on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.660 
boat come on
and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> penalty<00:01:41.640> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and I think that's the penalty on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.219 
and I think that's the penalty on
Williams<00:01:43.970> all<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> green<00:01:45.420> flag<00:01:45.689> we're<00:01:46.110> gonna

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
Williams all the green flag we're gonna

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.940 
Williams all the green flag we're gonna
be<00:01:46.380> strong

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
be strong

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.179 
be strong
I<00:01:48.049> think<00:01:49.049> Williams<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.409> lucky<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.009> honest

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
I think Williams was lucky to be honest

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800 
I think Williams was lucky to be honest
to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.430> away<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> penalty

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to get away with that not a penalty

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
to get away with that not a penalty
though<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.619> decision<00:01:52.799> from

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
though I think that right decision from

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
though I think that right decision from
the<00:01:53.280> umpires<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.790> green<00:01:54.000> flag<00:01:54.270> we've<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the umpires the green flag we've got a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
the umpires the green flag we've got a
dog<00:01:55.079> Willets<00:01:55.409> bring<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> bow<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.369> Taylor

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
