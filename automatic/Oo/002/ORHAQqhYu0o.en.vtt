00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.830 

one<00:00:01.439> thing<00:00:01.770> about<00:00:02.040> it<00:00:02.429> against<00:00:03.120> allure<00:00:03.570> is

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
one thing about it against allure is

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.080 
one thing about it against allure is
that<00:00:04.170> 90%<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:05.220> them<00:00:05.400> are<00:00:06.089> hand<00:00:06.600> dipped<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
that 90% of them are hand dipped and

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.999 
that 90% of them are hand dipped and
hand<00:00:09.090> split<00:00:10.250> now<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.700> means<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
hand split now what that means to you is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.609 
hand split now what that means to you is
that<00:00:14.210> when<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.570> something<00:00:16.109> that's<00:00:16.350> made

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that when you get something that's made

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.970 
that when you get something that's made
by<00:00:16.890> hand<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> lot<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.600> skirts<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
by hand you get a lot more skirts are a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
by hand you get a lot more skirts are a
lot<00:00:20.250> more<00:00:20.279> strands<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.390> skirt<00:00:21.810> than<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
lot more strands in your skirt than you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.029 
lot more strands in your skirt than you
would<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.920> injected<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:25.039> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
would if it was injected you you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
would if it was injected you you
probably<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:26.880> six<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.599> strands<00:00:28.050> in

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
probably get about six more strands in

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.120 
probably get about six more strands in
here<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.730> drawback<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
here the drawback on that is that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
here the drawback on that is that
sometimes<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:33.059> we're<00:00:33.329> hand<00:00:33.660> splitting<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
sometimes when we're hand splitting a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.819 
sometimes when we're hand splitting a
million<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.950> million<00:00:35.700> jigs<00:00:36.500> sometimes<00:00:37.500> they'll

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
million a million jigs sometimes they'll

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.130 
million a million jigs sometimes they'll
they'll<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> hang<00:00:39.390> together<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.960> little

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
they'll kind of hang together a little

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.310 
they'll kind of hang together a little
bit<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.149> some<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> better<00:00:42.629> fishermen

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
bit so some of the better fishermen

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.529 
bit so some of the better fishermen
before<00:00:43.860> they'll<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.280> fishing<00:00:44.910> bill<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
before they'll go out fishing bill and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.590 
before they'll go out fishing bill and
they'll<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> few<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> these<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> they'll

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
they'll take a few of these and they'll

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380 
they'll take a few of these and they'll
and<00:00:48.960> they'll<00:00:49.739> finish<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.340> splitting<00:00:50.700> process

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and they'll finish the splitting process

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
and they'll finish the splitting process
on<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> doesn't<00:00:52.230> take<00:00:52.559> very<00:00:52.590> much<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
on them it doesn't take very much but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900 
on them it doesn't take very much but
it's<00:00:54.180> important<00:00:55.430> another<00:00:56.430> thing<00:00:56.789> that's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's important another thing that's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.959 
it's important another thing that's
important<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.780> skirt<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.969> there's

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
important about a skirt is that there's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.990 
important about a skirt is that there's
a<00:01:00.030> lot<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> salt<00:01:00.690> added<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> these<00:01:01.500> lures<00:01:02.000> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
a lot of salt added to these lures and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.590 
a lot of salt added to these lures and
when<00:01:03.210> there's<00:01:03.710> if<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> lure<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.549> plastic<00:01:06.330> lure

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
when there's if the lure a plastic lure

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
when there's if the lure a plastic lure
has<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.530> salt<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> an

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
has a lot of salt in it which is an

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.649 
has a lot of salt in it which is an
excellent<00:01:10.020> fish<00:01:10.409> attractant<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.420> it's<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
excellent fish attractant and it's not

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.219 
excellent fish attractant and it's not
split<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:14.760> salt<00:01:15.210> doesn't<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
split that salt doesn't get out in the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.230 
split that salt doesn't get out in the
water<00:01:17.150> when<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.810> put<00:01:19.229> flavors<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
water when we when we put flavors and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.810 
water when we when we put flavors and
attractants<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:22.409> tubes<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.610> we

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
attractants in these tubes and then we

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
attractants in these tubes and then we
split<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> skirts<00:01:26.000> all<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
split the skirts all of that all of that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.950 
split the skirts all of that all of that
dissipates<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> water<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:31.229> good

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
dissipates in the water really good

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
dissipates in the water really good
being<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.380> thin<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:36.140> troupe<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.409> even<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.950> sit

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
being so thin a troupe can even just sit

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.870 
being so thin a troupe can even just sit
on<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.520> bottom<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> skirts<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.579> fine

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
on the bottom and if the skirts are fine

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.230 
on the bottom and if the skirts are fine
like<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:42.840> they're<00:01:42.960> hand<00:01:43.259> split

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
like they are when they're hand split

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.899 
like they are when they're hand split
they'll<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.770> they'll<00:01:46.770> they'll<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
they'll do this they'll they'll just

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.819 
they'll do this they'll they'll just
have<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> slight<00:01:48.540> motion<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> water<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
have a slight motion in the water and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.609 
have a slight motion in the water and
then<00:01:49.979> suddenly<00:01:50.750> official<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.899> watching<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
then suddenly official be watching that

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
then suddenly official be watching that
and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:53.970> twitch

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then if you do put a little twitch

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
and then if you do put a little twitch
on<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.869> something<00:01:55.700> he<00:01:56.700> interprets<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.390> as

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
on it or something he interprets that as

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.709 
on it or something he interprets that as
being<00:01:57.930> something<00:01:58.049> alive<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.149> he'll<00:02:00.479> come

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
being something alive and and he'll come

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.319 
being something alive and and he'll come
for<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.369> usually<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.700> come<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.180> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
for it usually when they come for this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.780 
for it usually when they come for this
compared<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> crankbait

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
compared to a crankbait

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.690 
compared to a crankbait
they<00:02:06.380> they'll<00:02:07.380> hit<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.069> they'll<00:02:08.489> come

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
they they'll hit it and they'll come

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.330 
they they'll hit it and they'll come
back<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:08.940> they'll<00:02:09.270> hit<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.539> again

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
back and they'll hit it again

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.820 
back and they'll hit it again
and<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.599> almost<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:15.080> almost<00:02:15.349> as<00:02:15.650> if

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and it's almost as if it's almost as if

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
and it's almost as if it's almost as if
you<00:02:15.950> are<00:02:15.980> using<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.520> live<00:02:16.730> room<00:02:17.000> or<00:02:17.300> something

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you are using a live room or something

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.290 
you are using a live room or something
because<00:02:18.440> you'll<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.610> more<00:02:19.849> more

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
because you'll just get more more

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.239 
because you'll just get more more
