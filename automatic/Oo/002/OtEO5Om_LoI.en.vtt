00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.830 
cherry blossom and now having issues I
think<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.790> boots<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.600> bit<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
think with the boots going a bit of a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.370 
think with the boots going a bit of a
weird<00:02:38.080> color<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.770> purpley<00:02:39.520> color<00:02:39.790> if<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.019> use

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
weird color a purpley color if you use

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.040 
weird color a purpley color if you use
the<00:02:41.680> leather<00:02:42.069> grits

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
the leather grits

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.900 
the leather grits
this<00:02:44.050> will<00:02:44.290> feed<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.220> leathers<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.819> are

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
this will feed the leathers that are

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.600 
this will feed the leathers that are
used<00:02:46.180> by<00:02:46.540> Alberg<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.980> will<00:02:48.160> look<00:02:48.430> after

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
used by Alberg and it will look after

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.540 
used by Alberg and it will look after
and<00:02:48.910> protect<00:02:48.970> your<00:02:49.360> boots
