00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.069
 sa and maribel rivas and starts this precept of furniture more kids already makes 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.170
 several years and by this means I would like to share with you some 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.409
 tips that you hope will be useful 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.859
 when we went out to look for a piece of furniture we found different proposals 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.460
 and there are no doubts as to which will be the best option in 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 relation to materials and paintings 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.909
 it is then likely that it will cost us to distinguish between quality and prices 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.230
 it seems that the idea 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.450
 I would like to help you make the best decision when buying the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.980
 furniture for your girls 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.460
 as we know well 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.680
 we can meet 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 the web is made by one side in masisa wood 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.600
 and when we talk about massif it is important to highlight the nobility and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.430
 rigidity in a well-stacked manner of poor availability in these 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.250
 time 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
 in front of what we find in the scoreboard 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.850
 a way that is not parked 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 look to breathe work and consequently it is going to twist 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 On the other hand are the murals made on plates 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.300
 one of those is the agglomerate that are minutes in lines 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.369
 The difficulty with this product is that it tends to shed 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.420
 therefore it can not be given again 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.230
 nor land 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.500
 although presented in some equal parts as interiors of drawers or 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.340
 doors 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 the first premise completions 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.600
 It is economical and light 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
 the other material that is presented in plates is the nds 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 acronym in English means medium density quality 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.310
 this product this high cost 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 It contains a homogeneous and compact structure that allows to manipulate it 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.450
 without you being thyssen and deformen they went of echo in the step of the time 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 It should be noted that the use of air conditioning and heating does not alter 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 the joints and does not produce cracks in the lacquer 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.799
 this material so dian 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.610
 for being 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.799
 ec have a very fine texture and a perfect finish 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.229
 it is the ideal material for which it burns 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.709
 both in plenums and songs 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.810
 by iso furniture more guys uses mdf in all their furniture 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.639
 Regarding final finishes I want to tell you about the lacap forget so 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.289
 icahn 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.399
 a finish for furniture of frequent use that I demand these to the daily use 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
 It is high strength and excellent termination 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.509
 to get an idea is the same product that is used in ee the 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.639
 plasticizing of floors although in other proportions for furniture 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.519
 its application is expensive given the number of steps incorporating 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.810
 products that are required claimed to achieve a soft touch 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.589
 the steps of the one that suffers are three 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:57.429
 First 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:58.769
 the sealer 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.239
 second is the anchorage because look tannic 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.849
 and finally the layers of the can 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:12.329
 also between each of these pasts will be a craft sanding work 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.969
 to end 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.839
 in its maintenance it is not necessary to apply any type of cleaner 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.239
 abrasive I know that cleaning my surface skill prevents the entry of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.049
 external agents will simply suffice to wipe a damp cloth
