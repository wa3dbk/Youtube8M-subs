Hi, my name is Milos, also known as Melon

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.073
We are here to show you the organisation of Dota 2 Serbia.

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:16.153
Lets check what is our team working!

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880
This is our work atmosphere.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.200
This is our designer which is working on development of "User profiles"

00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:32.254
This is our team of programmers.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.060
The forum is being worked here, as you can see, it is finally done. 

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:44.493
This is our young pair of programmers which are programming something on our site. (Hye people)

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.700
We use our free time here after we finish the job for our community.

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:08.913
These are our guys that keep our social networks work and write news for our site.

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.475
Here we play a bit of Fifa, PES and have fun

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:17.853
I want to use this chance to thank all the people that are not here and they work with us.

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:20.893
Actually, we are here in a different reason.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:24.293
That reason is Balkan Challenger project that i will present you here.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.060
As i said, the thing is about Balkan Challenger tournament 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.920
Where teams from whole Europe can participate.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.460
This tournament will start 25th of June and will last for a month.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.200
As you can see yourself, we provided you 512 slots for teams.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.540
Now, I want to thank Computerland and Logitech which provided us with these prizes.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.720

00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:23.433
As you know, this tournament will have a Dota 2 Ticket that has a Slark set going with it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.180
And the part of the fond from tickets will raise the prize pool

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.740
Our organisation has decided to bring the prize pool to a higher level

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.120
So we decided to make a participation fond of 5 euros per team or 1 euro per player

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:43.335

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.900
