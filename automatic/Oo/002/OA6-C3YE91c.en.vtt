the cool thing about these thunder

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.169 
the cool thing about these thunder
enclosures<00:00:01.620> as<00:00:01.800> well<00:00:02.010> they're<00:00:02.909> pretty<00:00:03.000> much

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
enclosures as well they're pretty much

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.210 
enclosures as well they're pretty much
pre-wired<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.770> way<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:04.950> you're<00:00:05.100> using

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
pre-wired so that way if you're using

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.730 
pre-wired so that way if you're using
two<00:00:05.520> single<00:00:05.879> form<00:00:06.210> woofers<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:07.440> got<00:00:07.529> one

around the lip of the wolf or that way

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.660 
around the lip of the wolf or that way
you<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.960> any<00:00:28.170> air<00:00:28.289> leakage<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> you

you don't have any air leakage and you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
you don't have any air leakage and you
know<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> best<00:00:30.390> sound<00:00:30.570> quality<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
possible all the wolf is that you're me
and<00:00:32.430> putting<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.910> enclosure<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.989> I'm

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and putting in this enclosure so I'm

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.090 
and putting in this enclosure so I'm
gonna<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.230> ahead<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> start<00:00:34.770> putting<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
gonna go ahead and start putting this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
gonna go ahead and start putting this
all<00:00:35.250> around<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> board<00:00:35.930> another<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
all around the board another thing is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.979 
all around the board another thing is
when<00:00:37.380> you're<00:00:37.469> drilling<00:00:38.899> mounting<00:00:39.899> your

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
when you're drilling mounting your

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
when you're drilling mounting your
woofer<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.820> usually<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> use<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.210> screw

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
woofer I usually like to use a screw

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.639 
woofer I usually like to use a screw
that's<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> penetrate<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> way

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's going to penetrate all the way

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.580 
that's going to penetrate all the way
through<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.550> actual<00:00:44.850> box<00:00:45.059> itself<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:46.379> half

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
through the actual box itself not half

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
through the actual box itself not half
way<00:00:46.770> through<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.370> through<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.210> if

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
way through all the way through so if

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
way through all the way through so if
you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> long<00:00:48.840> screw<00:00:49.200> don't<00:00:49.770> worry

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you have to use a long screw don't worry

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.299 
you have to use a long screw don't worry
about<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
about it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.410 
about it
another<00:00:50.879> thing<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> be

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
another thing you would want to be

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
another thing you would want to be
careful<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:53.030> slipping<00:00:54.030> off<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.180> screw<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
careful of is slipping off the screw and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.060 
careful of is slipping off the screw and
going<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.469> surround<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> your

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
going through your surround of your

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.529 
going through your surround of your
woofer<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.610> usually<00:00:57.199> take<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.230> hand<00:00:59.539> start

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
woofer so I usually take my hand start

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.580 
woofer so I usually take my hand start
to<00:01:00.629> drill<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> put<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.230> hand<00:01:01.410> there

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to drill and I put my hand there

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.930 
to drill and I put my hand there
I<00:01:01.649> rather<00:01:01.829> hurt<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.160> hand<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> wolf<00:01:02.820> air

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I rather hurt my hand and the wolf air

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170 
I rather hurt my hand and the wolf air
itself<00:01:03.229> tell<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> truth<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
itself tell you the truth because I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
itself tell you the truth because I
really<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.659> replacing<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.590> right

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
really don't like replacing them right

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.800 
really don't like replacing them right
now<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.790> trying<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.240> wire<00:01:09.510> through

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
now I'm trying to get my wire through

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
now I'm trying to get my wire through
here<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.140> wire<00:01:10.320> feeder<00:01:10.590> trying<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> shoot

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here with my wire feeder trying to shoot

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
here with my wire feeder trying to shoot
it<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.740> where<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> enclosure

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it up and over to where the enclosure

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.899 
it up and over to where the enclosure
will<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:15.990> difficult<00:01:16.500> than

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
will be a little bit more difficult than

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
will be a little bit more difficult than
I<00:01:17.909> expected<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> get

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I expected right now see if we can get

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.110 
I expected right now see if we can get
it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.640 
it
so<00:01:23.120> this<00:01:23.270> particular<00:01:23.420> 12-gauge<00:01:24.110> wire<00:01:24.320> from

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
so this particular 12-gauge wire from

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.690 
so this particular 12-gauge wire from
Street<00:01:24.950> wires<00:01:25.240> it's<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> pretty<00:01:26.450> thick<00:01:26.540> loom<00:01:27.700> as

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
Street wires it's a pretty thick loom as

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.250 
Street wires it's a pretty thick loom as
well<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:28.970> protect<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.360> wire<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.840> actually

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
well to protect the wire and actually

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.290 
well to protect the wire and actually
makes<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.500> little<00:01:30.650> bit<00:01:30.770> easier<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.100> run<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.700> in

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
makes a little bit easier to run and in

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.090 
makes a little bit easier to run and in
some<00:01:32.600> cases<00:01:32.869> especially<00:01:33.440> like<00:01:33.740> through<00:01:33.890> door

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
some cases especially like through door
