00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
top right so that you can pry it apart

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.350 
top right so that you can pry it apart
I<00:02:07.689> would<00:02:08.289> recommend<00:02:08.560> using<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.310> coin<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.700> kind

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
I would recommend using a coin and kind

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.960 
I would recommend using a coin and kind
of<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:10.660> pried<00:02:11.200> apart<00:02:11.410> but<00:02:12.069> for

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
of just pried apart but for

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.520 
of just pried apart but for
demonstration<00:02:13.090> purposes<00:02:13.959> I'm<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.470> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.370 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to
use<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.709> nails<00:02:15.100> dig<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.380> just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
use my nails dig it in there and just

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.920 
use my nails dig it in there and just
pry<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.709> apart<00:02:18.120> once<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.239> get<00:02:19.330> going<00:02:19.630> it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
pry it apart once you get going it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.110 
pry it apart once you get going it's
quite<00:02:20.140> easy<00:02:20.380> there's<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.280> six<00:02:21.580> tabs<00:02:21.880> that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
quite easy there's just six tabs that

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.870 
quite easy there's just six tabs that
you<00:02:22.300> need<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> pull<00:02:22.690> apart<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.670> that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
you need to pull apart and this is that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.960 
you need to pull apart and this is that
ever<00:02:25.180> foam<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.170> you're<00:02:26.350> talking<00:02:26.530> about

ever foam that you're talking about

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.870 
ever foam that you're talking about
pretty<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.980> soft<00:02:29.980> rubber<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.730> help
