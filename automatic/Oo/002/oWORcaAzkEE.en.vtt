00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.110
 Radio control helicopter introduction practice method 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:12.480
 Number 7 ladder turn 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:17.510
 As the practice of face-to-face hovering meeting in practice method number 6 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.700
 I practiced the 180 degree rotation by the ladder 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:29.270
 This time we go one step ahead and add elevator operation 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.290
 180 rotations at the position where the radio controlled helicopter was moved back and forth and hovered 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.820
 I do 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.820
 Practice Ladder Turn 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:45.460
 When to advance the radio-controlled helicopter through before the elevator stick a little 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.920
 The rotation surface of the main rotor is inclined forward 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:57.219
 In order to stop the progress of the radio control helicopter for that purpose elevator stick 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:01.450
 Radio control helicopter by pulling back and tilting the rotation plane of the main rotor back 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 Pull up the model of and stop it 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:12.030
 This operation is called flare 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 And in the neutral the elevator stick just before the whole body of the radio-controlled helicopter is stopped 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.190
 Return and return the main rotor's plane of rotation to horizontal 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.870
 Go into hovering playback 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:30.980
 This operation can be done either in the normal forward state or in the face- to- face state where the direction is changed 180 degrees 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.980
 To practice 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:42.040
 In the video, flare from level flight and stop and hover once 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.160
 I have a 180 degree turn using a ladder 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 If you can get hold of this, from the same movement 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:55.850
 Skipping hovering and using the lever just before the radio control helicopter stops due to flare 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 Make the turn of 180 degrees 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:09.739
 Direction of 180 degrees with backward inclination due to flare remaining on the rotation surface of the main rotor 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.700
 Since the conversion is performed, the rotating surface of the main rotor is inclined forward when the direction change is finished 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.280
 It will be 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:22.660
 The whole body starts right after the turn 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:28.520
 It leads to further promote and stall turn this in Naa turn When you put the flare 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.790
 Please be careful not to become too fast helicopter speed during practice 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.680
 Continue to practice unreasonable practice 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.680
 Please aim for steady level up
