00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
Nissan Altima video I'll show that was a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.779 
Nissan Altima video I'll show that was a
harsh<00:00:12.300> shift<00:00:15.980> what<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> problem<00:00:17.430> with<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
harsh shift what was the problem with it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
harsh shift what was the problem with it
was<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> fact<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.230> engine<00:00:19.890> wasn't

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
was was the fact that the engine wasn't

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.950 
was was the fact that the engine wasn't
getting<00:00:20.310> enough<00:00:20.369> fuel<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.630> fuel

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
getting enough fuel because the fuel

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
getting enough fuel because the fuel
hose<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.350> leaking<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> also<00:00:23.010> had<00:00:23.250> about

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
hose was leaking and I also had about

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.859 
hose was leaking and I also had about
four<00:00:23.699> other<00:00:23.820> vacuum<00:00:24.240> leaks<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
four other vacuum leaks or I think it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.820 
four other vacuum leaks or I think it
was<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.080> three<00:00:25.289> leaks<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.590> something<00:00:25.769> like

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
was like three leaks or something like

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
was like three leaks or something like

Henderson area it started snowing or

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.960 
Henderson area it started snowing or
just<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.300> little<00:02:44.480> bit<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.430> Summerlin

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
just a little bit and in the Summerlin

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
just a little bit and in the Summerlin
area<00:02:47.090> probably<00:02:47.480> snowed<00:02:47.960> a<00:02:47.990> lot<00:02:48.200> because<00:02:48.410> in

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
area probably snowed a lot because in

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.440 
area probably snowed a lot because in
Summerlin<00:02:49.490> it's<00:02:49.730> generally<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> higher

Summerlin it's generally a higher

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.480 
Summerlin it's generally a higher
elevation<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.350> there's<00:02:51.530> always<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.860> lot<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:54.490> it

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
elevation so there's always a lot of it

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.770 
elevation so there's always a lot of it
gets<00:02:55.670> colder<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.150> than<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.630> down

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
until it gets like 40 then that's where

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.720 
until it gets like 40 then that's where
it's<00:03:05.870> supposed<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.200> bounce

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
it's supposed to bounce

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.220 
it's supposed to bounce
that's<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:07.940> family<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.450> engine<00:03:08.720> recovering

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
that's just family the engine recovering

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.610

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.580 
they're very smart as well I must say
but<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.910> main<00:03:29.090> thing<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.840> sometimes

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
but the main thing is is that sometimes

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.320 
but the main thing is is that sometimes
women<00:03:30.980> require<00:03:31.220> maintenance<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.090> car

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
women require maintenance and this car

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.520 
women require maintenance and this car
definitely<00:03:32.570> requires<00:03:33.140> maintenance

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
definitely requires maintenance

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.020 
definitely requires maintenance
considering<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.340> fact<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.670> his<00:03:34.760> name<00:03:34.790> is

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
considering the fact that his name is

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.250 
considering the fact that his name is
Joan<00:03:35.239> B<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.690> girl<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:37.959> mainly<00:03:38.959> though

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
Joan B and it's a girl so mainly though

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.380 
Joan B and it's a girl so mainly though
is<00:03:39.560> if<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.400> see<00:03:40.640> your<00:03:40.730> engine<00:03:40.940> kind<00:03:41.300> of

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
is if you do and see your engine kind of

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.180 
is if you do and see your engine kind of
kicking<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:41.930> out<00:03:42.080> sometimes<00:03:42.620> check<00:03:43.040> your

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
kicking in and out sometimes check your

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.220 
kicking in and out sometimes check your
fuel<00:03:43.459> because<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.269> fuel<00:03:44.540> has<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> lot<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.019> do

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
fuel because the fuel has a lot to do

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.590 
fuel because the fuel has a lot to do
with<00:03:45.350> how<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.530> car<00:03:45.769> drives<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.489> if<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.150> you

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
with how the car drives and if it you

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.180 
with how the car drives and if it you
know<00:03:47.720> if<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:47.959> doesn't<00:03:48.260> drive<00:03:48.440> well<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.100> you're

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
know if it doesn't drive well and you're

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.890 
know if it doesn't drive well and you're
constantly<00:03:49.730> having<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.209> floor<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.480> pedal

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
constantly having to floor the pedal

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.259 
constantly having to floor the pedal
just<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.140> get<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.380> going<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.860> probably<00:03:52.640> have<00:03:52.910> a

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
just to get it going you probably have a

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.990 
just to get it going you probably have a
fuel<00:03:53.720> problem<00:03:53.930> or<00:03:54.410> your<00:03:55.130> engine<00:03:55.580> has<00:03:55.790> just

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
fuel problem or your engine has just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.680 
fuel problem or your engine has just
worn<00:03:56.209> down<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:57.500> no<00:03:57.709> longer<00:03:58.040> useful<00:03:58.690> so

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
worn down and it's no longer useful so

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.010

like<00:04:37.150> complex<00:04:37.540> equations<00:04:38.080> although<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.380> hate

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
like complex equations although I hate

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.050 
like complex equations although I hate
relationships<00:04:38.800> cuz<00:04:39.460> those<00:04:39.580> are<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:39.820> way<00:04:40.000> too

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
I just was just not equations and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.420 
I just was just not equations and
they're<00:04:41.920> just<00:04:42.040> very<00:04:42.130> imbalanced<00:04:44.430> anyway

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
they're just very imbalanced anyway
