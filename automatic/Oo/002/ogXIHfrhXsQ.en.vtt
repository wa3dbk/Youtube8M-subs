00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
boosters and these tests are all

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.930 
boosters and these tests are all

one two three and four on the fourth
petal<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.850> don't<00:00:36.570> release<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.290> keep

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
petal you don't release it you keep

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.400 
petal you don't release it you keep
holding<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.399> start<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> car<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:43.079> pedal

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
should sink and if it does your brake

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
should sink and if it does your brake
booster<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.590> good<00:00:46.980> working<00:00:47.160> condition

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
booster is in good working condition

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.580 
booster is in good working condition
okay<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.450> test<00:00:48.690> two<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.680> start<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> car

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
okay so for test two you start the car

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
okay so for test two you start the car
and<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.879> let<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.180> idle<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.870> minutes<00:00:56.750> say

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and you let it idle for two minutes say

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.400 
and you let it idle for two minutes say
two<00:00:58.020> minutes<00:00:58.170> passed<00:00:58.530> already<00:00:59.210> you<00:01:00.410> apply

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
two minutes passed already you apply

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.850 
two minutes passed already you apply
pressure<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> brake<00:01:02.219> pedal<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> hold<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
pressure to the brake pedal and hold it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.300 
pressure to the brake pedal and hold it
turn<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> vehicle<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> pedal

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
turn off the vehicle and the pedal

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.800 
turn off the vehicle and the pedal
shouldn't<00:01:08.700> rise<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.720> least<00:01:09.869> 30<00:01:10.170> seconds

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
shouldn't rise for at least 30 seconds

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
shouldn't rise for at least 30 seconds
if<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.229> doesn't<00:01:13.619> rise<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.580> check<00:01:14.790> valve

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
if it doesn't rise then your check valve

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320 
if it doesn't rise then your check valve
is<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.710> does<00:01:16.920> rise<00:01:17.189> within<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.180> know

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is good if it does rise within you know

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.710 
is good if it does rise within you know
say<00:01:19.049> 10<00:01:19.290> seconds<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> sooner<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.630> know

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
say 10 seconds or is sooner or you know

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
say 10 seconds or is sooner or you know
before<00:01:22.110> 30<00:01:22.350> seconds<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:24.119> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
before 30 seconds is up then you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.450 
before 30 seconds is up then you
probably<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> problem<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.740> okay<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.040> for

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
probably have a problem with okay so for

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.569 
probably have a problem with okay so for
the<00:01:26.549> third<00:01:26.759> test<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> last<00:01:27.540> test<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.579> start

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the third test the last test you start

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.120 
the third test the last test you start
the<00:01:29.700> car

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the car

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.999 
the car
let<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.970> idle<00:01:32.090> for<00:01:32.420> two<00:01:32.570> minutes<00:01:32.950> say<00:01:33.950> two

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
let it idle for two minutes say two

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.700 
let it idle for two minutes say two
minutes<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.610> up<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.810> turn<00:01:36.020> off<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.290> vehicle

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
minutes is up you turn off the vehicle

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.270 
minutes is up you turn off the vehicle
and<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:38.689> pump<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.170> brake<00:01:39.440> pedal<00:01:39.770> three<00:01:40.009> times

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
and you pump the brake pedal three times

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.249 
and you pump the brake pedal three times
so<00:01:40.940> one<00:01:41.200> two<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.500> three<00:01:43.659> pay<00:01:44.659> attention<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
so one two and three pay attention to

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.219 
so one two and three pay attention to
your<00:01:45.350> brake<00:01:45.590> pedal<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.399> should<00:01:46.670> rise<00:01:47.229> every

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
your brake pedal it should rise every

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.100 
your brake pedal it should rise every
time<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.560> press<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.159> if<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.090> does<00:01:50.270> your

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
time you press it and if it does your

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.810 
time you press it and if it does your
brake<00:01:51.320> booster<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.740> check<00:01:51.950> valve<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.670> good

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
brake booster and check valve is in good

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.070 
brake booster and check valve is in good
working<00:01:52.880> condition<00:01:53.180> all<00:01:53.659> right<00:01:53.780> those<00:01:54.049> are

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
working condition all right those are

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.279 
working condition all right those are
three<00:01:54.440> easy<00:01:54.560> steps<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.750> they're<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:56.960> easy<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
three easy steps and they're so easy a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.940 
three easy steps and they're so easy a
caveman<00:01:57.470> could<00:01:57.890> do<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.110> before<00:02:00.110> going<00:02:00.530> you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
caveman could do it so before going you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.529 
caveman could do it so before going you
know<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.229> diagnosis<00:02:03.229> or<00:02:03.530> technician<00:02:04.130> if<00:02:04.700> you

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
know to a diagnosis or technician if you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.630 
know to a diagnosis or technician if you
have<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.720> brake<00:02:06.020> light<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.500> or<00:02:07.130> you're<00:02:07.610> just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
have a brake light on or you're just

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.070 
have a brake light on or you're just
having<00:02:08.030> problem<00:02:08.360> with<00:02:08.479> your<00:02:08.600> brakes<00:02:08.810> you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
having problem with your brakes you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.059 
having problem with your brakes you
could<00:02:09.800> simply<00:02:10.130> do<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.459> test<00:02:10.700> yourself<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
could simply do this test yourself and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.710 
could simply do this test yourself and
just<00:02:13.069> test<00:02:13.459> these<00:02:13.700> tests<00:02:14.000> should<00:02:14.239> give<00:02:14.540> you

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
just test these tests should give you
