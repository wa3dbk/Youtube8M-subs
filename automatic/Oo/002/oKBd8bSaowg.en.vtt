 put the eggs oil and sugar and beat 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.140
 this mix 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.140
 [Music] 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 We'll open that cover later. 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.280
 I do not know if all the liquids 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 blenders without that we'll go 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.979
 leave like this and go putting phatic 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.789

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.009
 he knows 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.619
 So you but you can leave it open 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.020
 Also care for the mouse in your night. 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 house and such by placing one by one and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.899
 It's very cool. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 now I've put all the carrots there 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.909
 inside then I'll leave knocking 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.849
 while I go back to my form but 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.349
 You can po 'stop beating you put 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.840
 Look again, what you see. 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.700
 there you can hope we can go wrong and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.509
 do it melek then put in field of 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.780
 Ok it's good 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.060
 before closing and the texture in this mixture 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.039
 stay like this, it looks good, ball 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.310
 You see, it looks good there, but yes. 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.500
 so softly not that the ball is not 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 and we're going to focus that mix on a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.409
 canister 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.840
 Or you can hit the mixer right there. 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.849
 good not just for fun or that I 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.000
 I'm going to hit the wheat flour now. 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.920
 knock a spoon wooden stick 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.660
 I find it much easier because it is very 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.389
 Difficult to have there, I prefer to wash 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.920
 a void so let's hit two 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.299
 We put people half after 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940
 put another part does not stay that 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.380
 very much everything at once looks good 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.980
 It then lasts vocally slowly to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.109
 hit 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 let's now also to warm the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.639
 180 degree oven 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.260
 good now let's put the yeast as 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.989
 I already told you in another video that the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.930
 cake denies crazy there I told you 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.040
 which beats the yeast very slowly 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.470
 gm is a good tip to mix well in 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.720
 yeast can show all the mass 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.299
 We're going to put people in the oven now. 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.530
 We'll leave it there for 40 to 45 minutes. 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.739
 in 180 degrees 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.620
 Then folks, it's just you take it out of the oven. 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.690
 and allow to cool and remove and place in a 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.150
 cute cup and she is afraid that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.950
 You want I know, I made chocolate 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.569

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.609

 You check that mouth too. 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.740
 only after that is the whole process the goal 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.100

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.980
 small knife with a blunt cut gives to 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.540
