00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.530
 happy welcome to the secondary channel 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:16.129
 dj prieto ginetta today I have to 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.440
 tell two important news two 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.170
 news that I did not want to do well 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.840
 a video for each news but they are 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.470
 important the two are worth with him about 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.449
 bungee and the other on the coral warcraft 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 there are people who are very interested in 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.460
 this game the most important to me is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.489
 bungee and that this company has 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.769
 completely abandoned the halo you know 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.929
 that bungee was the developer until 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.530
 the halo date and has been unlinked 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:48.829
 full of this the decision figure 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.659
 as a definitive and forever by 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.699
 what 343 industries immediately assume 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:59.329
 the command who we already knew would be 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.570
 commission and now it will be 100% of the saga 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.260
 and everything that comes with it is to say 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.290
 all the halo development of now in 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.470
 ahead will be borne by 343 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.470
 industries 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.920
 boom that bungee bungee like jumanji like 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 you want no part and no more 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.160
 developer is not delivered 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 unpublished statistics in your game 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.650
 about halo but as for example that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.759
 They have played more than 20 billion 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:36.080
 items that accumulate 3 235 thousand years of 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.930
 eyehole game 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.060
 In addition, more than 2600 have been used 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.090
 million hours of play with halo 2 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.950
 as to the title with the most deaths achieved 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.950
 76 million deaths 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.320
 by ebay and 'jumanji' we are leaving is a 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.060
 worth a great developer but good 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 343 industries does not have to be 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.939
 bad influence let's go and other news is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 that blizzard closes world servers 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.430
 of warcraft is forced to close 10 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.739
 servers in korea where the world of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.050
 warcraft has been losing followers month 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.489
 a month for quite some time neither 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.650
 even the new spell of 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.280
 resurrection that allowed to obtain 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.050
 directly a level 80 character has 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440
 Served for Korean users 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.690
 play the world of warcraft 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.700
 I had to explain a little about the flight 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.700
 warcraft because I do not have any sun 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.230
 I will continue 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.850
 the situation in with was quite 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 unsustainable since in the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.010
 servers there were so few people that neither 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.110
 it was even possible to do raid or groups 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.920
 great to undertake the great deeds 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.290
 something that indirectly still made 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.080
 there would be less desire to play for 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 course so hurry has had to 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.970
 make the decision to close these ten 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.350
 servers and relocate users of 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
 the same ones of the new saves for 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.390
 compensate for the lack of bad population 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 times for world of warcraft in korea 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.000
 where the game is ranked 9 out of 10 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.700
 of online titles played and not only that 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.730
 but that is fighting for the new 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.150
 left was for the moment in Korea still 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 dominating without problems to jon where is 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.390
 very, very popular this game you 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.650
 I leave with these two news are quite 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.840
 interesting the 2 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.430
 vance and it is dismissed totally leaves what 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.069
 leave everything in control in 343 industries and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.200
 blizzard had to close 10 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.610
 servers in Korea for lack of 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.670
 population and the lack of play 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.500
 bibles in this game in this country I think 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.849
 that I have nothing more to say the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.390
 entity if you have been interested in these 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.069
 news 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.650
 please comment and we love that 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.420
 tell a kiss to everyone and happy day 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.420
