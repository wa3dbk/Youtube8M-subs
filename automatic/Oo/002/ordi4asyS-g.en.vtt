00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
basically the gel on the light sphere

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
basically the gel on the light sphere
like<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.700> pointing<00:00:38.910> it

like that right and I'm pointing it
toward<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.780> model<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> cover

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
toward my model now I have the cover

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.889 
toward my model now I have the cover
here<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.920> light<00:00:44.100> sphere<00:00:44.250> dome<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
here the light sphere dome I'm going to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.080 
here the light sphere dome I'm going to
put<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.410> lens<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.789> lens

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
put it over my lens and have the lens

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
put it over my lens and have the lens
pretty<00:00:48.480> much<00:00:48.629> D<00:00:48.930> focused<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> make

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pretty much D focused I want to make

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
pretty much D focused I want to make
sure<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.969> focusing<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
sure it's not focusing because I want to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
sure it's not focusing because I want to
make<00:00:52.199> sure<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> nice<00:00:52.739> blurry<00:00:53.100> image

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
make sure that it's a nice blurry image

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.279 
make sure that it's a nice blurry image
so<00:00:54.180> I'll<00:00:54.270> put<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> lens<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
so I'll put this over the lens like that

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.869 
so I'll put this over the lens like that
right<00:00:58.289> next<00:00:58.440> face<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.399> we're<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.670> go

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
right next face and then we're gonna go

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.920 
right next face and then we're gonna go
take<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.780> shot<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> we're<00:01:03.840> gonna

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
take one shot like this and we're gonna

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
take one shot like this and we're gonna
do<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> custom<00:01:04.530> white<00:01:04.680> balance<00:01:04.710> off<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
do a custom white balance off that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
do a custom white balance off that
so<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.119> basically<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so we're basically here like this and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
so we're basically here like this and
you'll<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> histograms<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:09.030> in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you'll see that the histograms right in

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
you'll see that the histograms right in
the<00:01:09.180> middle<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.810> I've<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the middle and I've got kind of a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.460 
the middle and I've got kind of a
blueish<00:01:10.920> image<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.909> luge<00:01:12.299> blue<00:01:12.810> image<00:01:13.260> I'm

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
blueish image this luge blue image I'm

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
blueish image this luge blue image I'm
going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> color<00:01:14.610> balance<00:01:14.820> which

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to use to do a color balance which

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
going to use to do a color balance which
will<00:01:15.360> make<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> sky<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> opposite<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> blue

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
will make the sky the opposite of blue

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.940 
will make the sky the opposite of blue
so<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> custom<00:01:18.180> white<00:01:18.330> balance<00:01:18.360> now

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.510
