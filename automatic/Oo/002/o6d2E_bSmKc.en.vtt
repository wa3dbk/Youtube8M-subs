00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
well they're back into it now because

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.050 
well they're back into it now because
even<00:04:49.620> if<00:04:49.680> i<00:04:49.770> make<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:49.979> 3-1<00:04:50.370> that's<00:04:50.699> not<00:04:50.849> really

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
even if i make it 3-1 that's not really

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.580 
even if i make it 3-1 that's not really
dominating<00:04:51.569> in<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.960> same<00:04:52.110> way<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:52.409> it's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
dominating in the same way that it's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.779 
dominating in the same way that it's
2-nil<00:04:52.919> is<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:55.400> yeah<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.550> kind<00:04:56.639> of<00:04:56.729> thinking

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
2-nil is and yeah I was kind of thinking

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.760 
2-nil is and yeah I was kind of thinking
like<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.509> really<00:04:58.169> didn't<00:04:58.319> want<00:04:58.379> them<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.590> get

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
like I really didn't want them to get

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.969 
like I really didn't want them to get
another<00:04:58.979> goal<00:04:59.159> because<00:04:59.490> then<00:05:00.419> it's<00:05:00.810> gonna

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
another goal because then it's gonna

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.809 
another goal because then it's gonna
vastly<00:05:01.979> swing<00:05:02.159> their<00:05:02.340> way<00:05:02.460> but<00:05:02.520> they<00:05:02.759> actually

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
vastly swing their way but they actually

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.850 
vastly swing their way but they actually
did<00:05:03.150> again<00:05:03.780> on<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.020> stroke<00:05:04.199> of<00:05:04.229> half-time<00:05:04.349> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
did again on the stroke of half-time and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.529 
did again on the stroke of half-time and
I<00:05:05.099> know<00:05:05.159> they<00:05:05.310> say<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> lot<00:05:05.639> but<00:05:05.819> she<00:05:06.449> was

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
I know they say a lot but she was

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.790 
I know they say a lot but she was
actually<00:05:06.629> do<00:05:06.840> score<00:05:07.080> against<00:05:07.259> me<00:05:07.409> a<00:05:07.440> lot<00:05:07.500> on

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
actually do score against me a lot on

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.680 
actually do score against me a lot on
stroke<00:05:08.039> of<00:05:08.190> half-time<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:09.569> made

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
stroke of half-time and that made

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.050 
stroke of half-time and that made
actually<00:05:09.870> t<00:05:10.169> walk<00:05:10.349> to<00:05:10.650> all<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.759> I<00:05:11.879> was

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
actually t walk to all and I was

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.149 
actually t walk to all and I was
thinking<00:05:12.360> oh<00:05:12.599> she's<00:05:13.110> gonna<00:05:13.229> be<00:05:13.319> along<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> game

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
thinking oh she's gonna be along a game

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.740 
thinking oh she's gonna be along a game
if<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.400> don't<00:05:14.580> win<00:05:14.699> this<00:05:14.909> but<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.210> thought<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:15.539> do

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
if I don't win this but I thought I do

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.059 
if I don't win this but I thought I do
chance<00:05:16.020> of<00:05:16.139> winning<00:05:16.349> it<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.680> honest<00:05:16.919> like

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
chance of winning it to be honest like

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.070 
chance of winning it to be honest like
