00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 very good we are all going well here 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.670
 mysterium today we are irun book or 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.170
 pokemon insurgents but the chapter of 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.269
 today is not a normal chapter today I'm going 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.980
 to teach how to get the coffin tag 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 the alternative way to cooking people 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.810
 genetically modified and for that what 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
 what do we have to do if you remember being 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.230
 in a house here look here we have a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 paper toss jingle and pulled out the repellent 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 you remember in a house here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 they said that if we taught him a pokémon 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.060
 pseudo legendary 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.970
 do not exchange it you do not want it and what 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.739
 I searched and they are basically 7 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.510
 pokemon I will say your last blues 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 things are not 7 pokemon are those 7 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.200
 pokemon with their pro evolution is that I'm going 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 to say the latest evolution are if not 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 I remember evil dragon there throw 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.480
 intensely bildung archon haider 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 iconic dra 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 then for that what we have to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.519
 to do is to bring one of those pseudo 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 legendary or their revolutions and I'm going 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.010
 to teach how to get for that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 we have to come here we are here in mining 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.129
 town where the islands swirl to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 use the taxi pike which is what they have 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.170
 put to replace the voted rocket 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 that were like flight and for that we have 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 that come here we have that I came to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.980
 lane town because the only one that can 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.710
 get now good is 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.050
 it is the hermitage no no orbit similar 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.910
 guitar then for that what we have 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.430
 what to do is come here, the others do not know 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.470
 they could be liable before and I think that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.570
 is already on the friendship safari but the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840
 server is not going so we have to come 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.180
 here and look for the the samsara cave is us 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.430
 you remember her the samsara Cuba that is 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.950
 is here and here in theory the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 life at twentieth level so what 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.130
 Let's do it, it's going to be good, I'm going to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.800
 look for the orbit until I get out 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.580
 see if this is 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.610
 if the first host bitches you of a 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.190
 support to see let's land an ultra 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.990
 bol directly because basically 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.120
 because I'm going to kill him with any 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.760
 attack then to see if we capture the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 first or 112 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.530
 it was clear that he was not going to catch the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.149
 first of masses being a vital lahar 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.690
 Well, of course you can not attack with 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.700
 nothing 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.050
 because I'm going to kill him good maybe with 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.000
 fast chevy attack could could 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.910
 take away some life but not if 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.910
 I am to see 1 2 3 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.260
 so it would be worth the last but I will 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.490
 a little cut in the voice I'll make a 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.490
 small cut is already capturing it 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.710
 12 36 there we are to the third goes the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 expired and today has been true already 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.280
 we have the vital so what are we going 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.830
 to do is going to be 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.090
 not by any means because I do not 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.890
 I'm going to stay because we're going to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.920
 to exchange 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.140
 the girl was a little righteously 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.020
 removed the reference now you have already 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 seen right at the beginning of the road and no longer 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.470
 it's so much when the groups the because 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.930
 normal let's go back we have to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.959
 I will return to the city from the PC 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.700
 in this city because there is something that 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.170
 I want not to come to the center because 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.900
 where the other city ​​because there is something that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.600
 you'll see but well let's come here 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.590
 here is not good that taxi it is this 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.810
 in all cities but here 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.880
 I really do not know where it is so good 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.140
 first let's come here to the center 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.620
 Pokemon 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.620
 Y 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.650
 let's move a pokemon 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.900
 and as you can see, this one does not work 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.000
 this one does not work is not pseudo legendary 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.600
 Horus fucks alone would serve us in this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.790
 case then this one let's get it out 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.950
 As you can see, I do not have many pokemon because 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.110
 I just like to train the pokemon 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.370
 I will use we will leave out 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.069
 fly moon 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.360
 and we leave it here on the pc with the others 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.599
 because when you are alone my ancients 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.610
 pokemon or good if you remember coconut 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.680
 that I wanted to be the only one yes and the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.650
 High delta are that the one that teaches you 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.209
 it is this type in poison or fire that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.709
 the truth that does not have very good 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.390
 features but it's a delta because 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.890
 things a little happy and good is good 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.260
 but I do not want to change for example sion 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.139
 because it's worse so well I do not know where 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.120
 is the taxi pike in this city so 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.120
 I do not know if I do not really do not know if there 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.480
 guys here is this 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.420
 if not 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.020
 fuck it's worth here all of the pokemon center 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.370
 and what we have to do now is 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.180
 come here we enter this house that already 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.490
 we came and talked with this I have a 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.800
 pokémon that delta is the end I do not know what 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.460
 will be generous evolutions and as you see 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.069
 vital larve is something is 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.289
 is allowed or is it useful and well 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:05.930
 we are going to exchange the vitals for 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.930
 for culture and in my case it gives us 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.560
 delta racing there we have neither music nor 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.480
 It bothered as well as a lot of good flow 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.540
 here we have the end goal that they give us 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.620
 Same level as arbitrating kilos 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.330
 delivered so I recommend that you 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.520
 You take the vital nar because from the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.870
 level of more level the servers do not 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.280
 they work to cheat friendship but not like that 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.990
 that whatever is of less level so that you 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.550
 I recommend that you read by orbital and how 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.250
 you see is electric flying type or is it 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.110
 very curious to see has certain certain 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.550
 logic not because it 's avoiding in air 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.050
 that is flying have some logic 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.850
 that they can not have nothing but good 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.830
 the electric power at best 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.760
 because I already have the weak crazy and if not 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.660
 had weak that is not even 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.490
 electric the truth that I would like 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.470
 quite put it in the team because 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.900
 as you see acrobatics thunderball and hyper 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.360
 I'm very good attacks for a 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.650
 pokémon and it was not bad 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.690
 features has very good defense 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.580
 and he has the same is that I think 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.660
 special and is not bad so 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.610
 good 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.760
 because you can evolve it I do not know 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.320
 well look at one thing I think I have 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.140
 rare candies 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.190
 to see if I have I remember that yes 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.800
 that had rare candies where they are 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.180
 here we have three faces we are going to use 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.820
 one and see if the 78 evolves and there 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.220
 is evolving we are going to have 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.140
 let's see the end of the taco we did not take 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.840
 withing the cushion we already have it that is 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:33.840
 this one is worth ai ai ai ai ai we have 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.150
 delta wifi I do not know here it's really very 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.099
 very handsome because I do not know the symbols 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.289
 these cool many like kind 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.360
 electric or like the symbol I do not know 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.499
 electric I have the pokemon dead 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.900

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:52.569
 served and what good then that it serves you 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.740
 wifi more than me because the truth is not 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.060
 I think it's going to change because I do not want 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.159
 two electric pokemon although they have 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.139
 people that are flying type but good 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:01.180
 for now I 'm going to leave the pc so 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.550
