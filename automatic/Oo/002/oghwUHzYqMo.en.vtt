else you can forward the actual domain
itself<00:01:03.920> by<00:01:04.220> editing<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.180> existing<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.409> record

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:15.370 
here so for that you would just need to
change<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.020> IP<00:01:12.560> address<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.429> for<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.659> IP

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
change the IP address here for the IP

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.980 
change the IP address here for the IP
address<00:01:15.920> for<00:01:16.130> your<00:01:16.189> server<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.780> would

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
address for your server so you would

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.139 
address for your server so you would
just<00:01:18.020> change<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.770> like<00:01:19.579> this<00:01:21.399> but<00:01:22.399> if<00:01:22.700> like

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
just change that like this but if like

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.620 
just change that like this but if like
