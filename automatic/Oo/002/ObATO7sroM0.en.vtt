00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 impeccable as always we receive ariel s 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 80 per dollar design decoration in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.630
 function of various crazy things and the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.630
 restoration of restored furniture 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.630
 recycled 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.210
 let's see some things that can be 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.789
 do with materials that are not there 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 normally do not use to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.669
 to make furniture yes but that always 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.489
 there is somewhere in the house that comes to us 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.960
 well to condition it in a way 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.390
 different if these are going to see some 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.590
 pictures of furniture armed with 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.090
 wooden crates type of fruit in this 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.829
 you have to look for the quality of the product 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.699
 that we are going to use to make the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.050
 furniture if you use a lot this is better 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.199
 voucher voucher 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.650
 what are the elements that are used 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.250
 for the base where other houses go what 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.150
 is what only engages the cost 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.140
 explanations 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.880
 that hooks things but there are so many 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.869
 furniture possibilities that we can 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 do with the pallets 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.660
 Notice that there are chairs so and more for 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 outside that treatment must be given 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.550
 there are several qualities also like everything 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.009
 it's like all the main work that 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.050
 has all this is first of all the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.509
 list because actually all the wood 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.300
 that is used without all the wood that is 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 used to do this kind of 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.490
 Elements are worked in the rough then 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.810
 come with a termination let's say that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.560
 It is not related with 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.299
 for manual use very well there are people 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 that specializes in this by gomes and 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.360
 hold on a father makes your furniture and I 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.159
 I will not go out a bit let's say I think 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.450
 that is not that difficult either, there are things that 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.820
 they are quite simple to be able to achieve 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.179
 if there are people who use them and that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.560
 they make furniture and a carpenter offers them 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.930
 an architect and well I want 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.150
 take advantage of resigning something if in reality 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.630
 to see, I think this has to do more 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.060
 with more with a personal intention of 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.440
 one of wanting to arm something a 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.500
 shelving 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.739
 fruit fruit drawers good 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.099
 quality that stacked can work for you 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.760
 well as a library there are very nice 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.959
 water paintings to be able to do that 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.340
 for example there you have a backup of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.340
 cam has done with two positives 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.800
 There is like 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.070
 and a use of mobile old furniture 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.920
 that are reused for other things like 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.670
 that table for example for a monitor and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.340
 if today furniture is used well spent 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.950
 also there you have a pair of roses 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.570
 roll of cable cable if well painted 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.570
 neat with a glass lid 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.070
 a very modern architecture 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.440
 look at everything in its just measure 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.820
 let's say if you're going to have a modern house 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.440
 and you're going to have all the furniture made 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.270
 of pallets will not look good but if 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.510
 that's a detail he's going to give you 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.120
 give a touch of wave if you notice that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.660
 there are many external images this is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.020
 Can easily use to assemble 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.480
 some some armchair outside a table 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.120
 outside some times in a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 terrace this is very well offer the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.100
 interperie you put some cushions 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
 made on nautical hill and you can 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.210
 let live outside that you will not have 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680
 no problem later if they give you more 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.100
 hand you can make a bar of 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.530
 double kitchen if all this has to do 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:00.350
 also with dexterity and skill 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.270
 that everyone has if you have a warehouse 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.600
 out this would have very well but this 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.580
 to put some wine to invite 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.580
 your friends choice with the glasses 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.190
 a small shelf over the kitchen 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.840
 there are a lot of variables in this what 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.019
 important is to give it a good 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.699
 termination let's say this has a 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.870
 good finish for this I tell you to the 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:34.100
 machine you choose not necessarily a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.930
 sander paint and already leave it in good 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.870
 conditions so that you do not 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.720
 has in manual use exactly one 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.090
 cute painting a color and it is a detail 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.479
 that later will give your house with some 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.539
 element that will normally feel me 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:57.860
 like to recycle to seek to generate 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:01.460
 ideas a little the idea of this is to show 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.550
 things that one imagines and that suddenly 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.740
 he does not see and he realizes that I liked it 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.910
 I'm going to try and I have more 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.740
 project at home today I'm doing 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.979
 photos so you see the evolution very well 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.979
 we go
