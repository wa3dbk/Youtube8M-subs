when you think of the show now because

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.479 
when you think of the show now because
it<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> last<00:00:44.010> couple<00:00:44.070> seasons<00:00:44.250> they've

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it for the last couple seasons they've

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
definitely does manipulate the vote a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
definitely does manipulate the vote a
little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> help<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.020> people<00:01:25.290> on

the better you do is right and you're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.039 
the better you do is right and you're
meet<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> top<00:01:30.420> 20<00:01:30.689> routine<00:01:30.900> was

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
meet the top 20 routine was

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.810 
meet the top 20 routine was
choreographed<00:01:31.470> by<00:01:31.560> Travis<00:01:31.890> Wall<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
choreographed by Travis Wall right and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
choreographed by Travis Wall right and
it<00:01:33.060> talked<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it talked a little bit about that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.270 
it talked a little bit about that
because<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.680> always<00:01:34.860> find<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because I always find that that's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
because I always find that that's
interesting<00:01:35.880> sort<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> setting<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
interesting sort of setting it up in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.469 
interesting sort of setting it up in
your<00:01:36.990> style<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.460> slowly<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.210> into

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
your style and then slowly going into

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
a really good opportunity for us to show

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
America what our specialty is because we

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
America what our specialty is because we
don't<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> could<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> gone

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
don't really you know you could be gone

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.469 
don't really you know you could be gone
the<00:01:52.920> next<00:01:53.040> week<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> one

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the next week but if you have that one

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
the next week but if you have that one
week<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.930> least<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.350> show<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.159> I

week at least to show what you can do I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
think it really helps people get on your

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
think it really helps people get on your
side<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.680> team<00:01:58.890> yeah<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> especially

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
side and your team yeah and especially
in<00:02:00.390> my<00:02:00.479> case<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.960> no<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.619> knew<00:02:01.710> who

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
in my case like I no one really knew who

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
in my case like I no one really knew who
I<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.890> before<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.460> show<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.909> wasn't

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
I was before the show because I wasn't

showing ever into the live show so it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.560 
showing ever into the live show so it
was<00:02:05.340> crucial<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.119> week<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.329> think<00:02:06.390> was

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
i don't think that i think i think it's

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.150 
i don't think that i think i think it's
mainly<00:02:37.030> based<00:02:37.269> on<00:02:37.450> talent<00:02:37.629> but<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.860> story

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
a little bit more relatable I think this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.050 
a little bit more relatable I think this
season<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.920> think<00:03:06.099> also<00:03:06.250> was<00:03:06.519> different<00:03:06.879> in<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
season I think also was different in the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.850 
season I think also was different in the
sense<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.329> like<00:03:07.540> all<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.170> previous<00:03:08.349> seasons

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
sense that like all the previous seasons

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.080 
sense that like all the previous seasons
so<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.129> think<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.400> dance<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.940> never

say<00:03:47.230> what<00:03:47.349> do<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.470> think<00:03:47.590> about<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.829> 11th

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.360 
season I'm just like man it's just so
different<00:03:50.079> it's<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.530> technical<00:03:50.799> it's<00:03:51.190> all

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
different it's so technical it's all

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.220 
different it's so technical it's all
about<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.639> purity<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:52.000> dance<00:03:52.299> whereas<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.109> feel

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
bit more this season was total dance I I

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.360 
bit more this season was total dance I I
agree<00:04:02.079> with<00:04:02.109> that<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.889> actually<00:04:03.099> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
agree with that and this is actually the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.309 
agree with that and this is actually the
first<00:04:03.400> time<00:04:03.639> I'm<00:04:03.970> realizing<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:05.139> that

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
first time I'm realizing that now that

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.440 
first time I'm realizing that now that
he<00:04:05.410> pointed<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.859> out<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.160> does<00:04:06.310> seem<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.849> little

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
he pointed it out it does seem a little

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.819 
he pointed it out it does seem a little
bit<00:04:07.540> more<00:04:07.780> about<00:04:08.370> dance<00:04:09.370> rather<00:04:09.790> than<00:04:10.829> just

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
bit more about dance rather than just

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.620 
bit more about dance rather than just
playing<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> crowd<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.849> it's<00:04:13.269> more

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
playing to the crowd and it's more

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.629 
playing to the crowd and it's more
technique<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.410> rather<00:04:15.010> than<00:04:15.160> only

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
technique and rather than only

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.120 
technique and rather than only
performance<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.989> did<00:04:17.470> yeah<00:04:17.620> busy<00:04:17.919> because

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
performance and I did yeah busy because

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.289
