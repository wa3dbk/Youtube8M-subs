 Sunday m 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.620
 and it's a little overview in June June June June June June Cork 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.250
 in the nike 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.920
 order 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.730
 in that direction 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.010
 the 32 year old man in front of me 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.070
 in fact in order to save one of his sons from over 60% 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.800
 we knew we could hear the sound for nothing we have to follow a 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.460
 diet 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.729
 facing the critics the world of the 100 m freestyle favors too strong 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 French mutuality 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.580
 going 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.730
 however, the moment 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
 And it's not nothing 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.580
 next she the score 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 May 16 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 I am writing to you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 tahar 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 I guess it's because I thought further 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 still 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.429
 m 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.939
 it is obvious that even proposed an extreme plan b the extended group 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.949
 in Athens 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.919
 world 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.319
 to have 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 she will then have the choice between selling their well being 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.059
 Say the opposite 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 for the youngest 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 I'll be glad 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.929
 barroso without real trend 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.019
 more than 50 years of experience 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.989
 fillon 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.069
 Why 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 Yes and 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.379
 according to 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.379
 m 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.839
 Single 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.089
 the trimester 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.389
 m there again i'm going to see what i'm proposing so changes 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 this 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.979
 but a fifth run 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.039
 my husband 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.569
 30% 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.389
 I think that in fact to take his repertoire
