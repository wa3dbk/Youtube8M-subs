disposable<00:01:28.220> piping<00:01:28.579> bag<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.030> I've<00:01:29.180> just

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
disposable piping bag and I've just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.289 
disposable piping bag and I've just

paired that with just a round tipped
piping<00:01:32.960> nozzle<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.560> doesn't<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:33.920> be

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
piping nozzle so it doesn't have to be

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.219 
piping nozzle so it doesn't have to be
any<00:01:34.219> particular<00:01:34.340> size<00:01:34.880> any<00:01:35.210> round<00:01:35.600> tip<00:01:35.869> piping

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
any particular size any round tip piping

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.350 
any particular size any round tip piping
nozzle<00:01:36.350> will<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> first<00:01:38.030> thing<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
nozzle will do so the first thing that

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.120 
nozzle will do so the first thing that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.030 
want to stick them all to the board so
I've<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:41.990> used<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.469> little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.950> that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
I've just used a little bit of that

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560 
I've just used a little bit of that
frosting<00:01:43.460> kind<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.850> like<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.030> little<00:01:44.240> bit<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.479> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
frosting kind of like a little bit of a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.690 
frosting kind of like a little bit of a
glue<00:01:44.750> I've<00:01:45.290> positioned<00:01:45.680> all<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.159> my<00:01:46.280> cupcakes

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
glue I've positioned all of my cupcakes

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.399 
glue I've positioned all of my cupcakes
and<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.119> was<00:01:47.360> harder<00:01:47.689> than<00:01:47.719> it<00:01:47.899> looks<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.320> I'm

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
and this was harder than it looks so I'm

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.899 
and this was harder than it looks so I'm
also<00:01:48.560> going<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.920> link<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.430> bit<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.820> a

if you want to make this ghost a glowing

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.800 
if you want to make this ghost a glowing
ghost<00:03:17.770> or<00:03:18.070> just<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.670> regular<00:03:18.820> but<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.570> still

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
ghost or just a regular but I still

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.630 
ghost or just a regular but I still
recommend<00:03:20.140> using<00:03:20.500> our<00:03:20.710> glowing<00:03:20.980> frosting

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
recommend using our glowing frosting

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.490 
recommend using our glowing frosting
just<00:03:21.790> because<00:03:22.030> it's<00:03:22.180> really<00:03:22.480> really<00:03:22.690> nice<00:03:23.140> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
just because it's really really nice and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.950 
just because it's really really nice and
what<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.490> really<00:03:24.730> ghosty<00:03:25.300> white<00:03:25.510> kind<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
what is that really ghosty white kind of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.630 
what is that really ghosty white kind of
a<00:03:26.050> coloring<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:26.830> don't<00:03:27.100> want<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.370> use<00:03:27.490> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
a coloring if you don't want to use the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.400 
a coloring if you don't want to use the
tonic<00:03:27.970> water<00:03:28.150> for<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.450> quitting<00:03:28.750> effect<00:03:29.170> can

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
tonic water for that quitting effect can

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.500 
tonic water for that quitting effect can
just<00:03:29.620> replace<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.130> tonic<00:03:30.460> corner<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:31.150> milk

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
just replace the tonic corner with milk

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.270 
just replace the tonic corner with milk
all<00:03:31.810> right<00:03:31.990> so<00:03:32.200> you're<00:03:32.320> guys<00:03:32.530> should<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:33.100> be
