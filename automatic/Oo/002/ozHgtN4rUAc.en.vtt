that are laying down so this is like a
little<00:01:49.350> C<00:01:49.619> shape<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> backwards<00:01:51.000> C

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
little C shape and this is a backwards C

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
little C shape and this is a backwards C
shape<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.079> they're<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.799> taking<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
shape right here they're just taking a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.149 
shape right here they're just taking a
little<00:01:53.549> rest<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.659> our<00:01:54.810> basic<00:01:55.049> shapes<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.920> all
