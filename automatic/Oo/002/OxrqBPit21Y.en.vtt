is<00:01:16.140> no<00:01:16.500> buzzing<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:22.380> holds<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.939> unlike<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is no buzzing just holds so unlike the

when<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.200> holding<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.570> does

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
when it was holding with this one does

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.620 
when it was holding with this one does
not<00:01:30.600> buzz<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.710> fully<00:01:31.890> stalled<00:01:32.630> alright

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
not buzz when it's fully stalled alright

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.460 
not buzz when it's fully stalled alright
now<00:01:33.810> I've<00:01:34.020> disconnected<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.829> scale<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.470> my

first off going to the monitor mode on
the<00:01:53.159> radio<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:55.670> activate<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.110> automatic

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
the radio and activate the automatic

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.330

serve will sleep and with the throttle

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.330 
serve will sleep and with the throttle
stick<00:02:02.579> I'll<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.079> gradually<00:02:04.079> increase<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
stick I'll just gradually increase it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:19.479 
stick I'll just gradually increase it
and<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:07.039> kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> resolution

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.290 

go<00:02:20.489> up<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> screen<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.330> bit

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
go up on the screen a little bit

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:53.170 
go up on the screen a little bit
not<00:02:23.960> too<00:02:24.170> bad

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.380 

okay

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
okay

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.960 
okay
and<00:02:55.730> I'll<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:57.860> manually<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.820> see

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
and I'll just manually do it you can see

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:10.580 
and I'll just manually do it you can see
the<00:03:00.090> centering<00:03:07.880> kind<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.080> fluttering<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.260> over

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the centering kind of fluttering it over

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:21.200 
the centering kind of fluttering it over
there<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.810> well<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.850> that's<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
there but it's in as well and that's the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.330 
there but it's in as well and that's the
speed<00:03:21.540> at<00:03:21.750> 6.6<00:03:22.320> volts

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.729 

20<00:03:26.340> fast

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.130 

okay<00:03:33.739> okay<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:34.640> I'll<00:03:34.849> just<00:03:34.880> wiggle<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.510> servo

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
okay okay now I'll just wiggle the servo

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.600 
okay okay now I'll just wiggle the servo
um<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> little<00:03:36.530> bit<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.890> show<00:03:37.130> how<00:03:37.400> much

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
um a little bit and show how much

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:49.210 
um a little bit and show how much
servile<00:03:38.920> slop<00:03:39.920> our<00:03:40.840> gear<00:03:41.840> play<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:42.230> has<00:03:48.220> it's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
servile slop our gear play it has it's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.380 
servile slop our gear play it has it's
not<00:03:49.430> dead<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.010> best<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.720> could<00:03:53.720> be<00:03:53.870> worse
