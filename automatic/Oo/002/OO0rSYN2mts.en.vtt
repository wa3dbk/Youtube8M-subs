your<00:00:52.220> takeaway<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.879> wasn't<00:00:53.180> spectacular<00:00:53.390> but

your takeaway it wasn't spectacular but

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.689

you<00:00:53.900> never<00:00:54.110> look<00:00:54.290> down<00:00:54.470> on<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.680> win<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:55.100> did<00:00:55.460> think

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
you never look down on a win I did think

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.790 
you never look down on a win I did think
the<00:00:55.879> team<00:00:56.150> looked<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.600> little<00:00:56.839> bit<00:00:57.050> tired<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.620> I

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
the team looked a little bit tired and I

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.960 
the team looked a little bit tired and I
don't<00:00:57.830> think<00:00:58.040> they<00:00:58.220> control<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.790> line<00:00:58.940> of

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
don't think they control the line of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.399 
don't think they control the line of
scrimmage<00:00:59.089> like<00:00:59.540> I<00:00:59.750> thought<00:01:00.019> they<00:01:00.199> would

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
scrimmage like I thought they would

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.689 
scrimmage like I thought they would
against<00:01:00.680> Youngstown<00:01:01.100> State<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:01.489> think

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
against Youngstown State I think

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.130 
against Youngstown State I think
ultimately<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.239> comes<00:01:02.390> down<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.809> being<00:01:02.839> able

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
ultimately it comes down to being able

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.049 
ultimately it comes down to being able
to<00:01:03.260> execute<00:01:03.589> your<00:01:03.860> game<00:01:04.100> plan<00:01:04.339> on<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.670> offense

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
to execute your game plan on the offense

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.600 
to execute your game plan on the offense
defense<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.870> I<00:01:06.110> include<00:01:06.470> special<00:01:06.950> teams<00:01:07.159> it's

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
defense and I include special teams it's

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
defense and I include special teams it's
difficult<00:01:08.150> in<00:01:08.300> these<00:01:08.450> games<00:01:08.780> after<00:01:09.260> coming

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
difficult in these games after coming

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.320 
difficult in these games after coming
out<00:01:09.650> of<00:01:09.710> training<00:01:10.070> camp<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.760> really<00:01:11.060> don't
