original project e86 folder like get it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
original project e86 folder like get it
out<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> cars

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
out of there because some of the cars

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.459 
out of there because some of the cars
won't<00:00:45.149> work<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> them<00:00:46.050> oh<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
won't work or a lot of them oh if you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
won't work or a lot of them oh if you
don't<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> lot<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> engine

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
don't do that you get a lot of engine

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
don't do that you get a lot of engine
upgrades<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.350> great<00:00:49.620> because<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.460> like

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
upgrades which is great because I like

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
upgrades which is great because I like
that's<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.210> 20<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> sounds<00:00:52.440> cool<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that's our 20 and it sounds cool and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.459 
that's our 20 and it sounds cool and
stuff<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> upgrades<00:00:55.140> like

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
stuff and I think a lot of upgrades like

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
stuff and I think a lot of upgrades like
clutch<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.070> stuff<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:57.059> make<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> difference

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
clutch and stuff don't make a difference

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
clutch and stuff don't make a difference
but<00:00:57.989> maybe<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.039> don't<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.520> know

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
but maybe they do I don't I don't know

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.200 
but maybe they do I don't I don't know
again<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> use<00:01:00.960> ryans<00:01:01.410> sim<00:01:01.739> tires<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
again I use ryans sim tires there and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.219 
again I use ryans sim tires there and
you<00:01:03.329> push<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> whole<00:01:03.930> bunch<00:01:04.080> other

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you push you to the whole bunch other

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
you push you to the whole bunch other
options<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.769> stuff<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> use<00:01:05.909> blood<00:01:06.150> lock

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
options and stuff and I use blood lock

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.590 
options and stuff and I use blood lock
because<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.830> welded<00:01:08.400> diff<00:01:08.600> so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
because it's basically a welded diff so

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560 
because it's basically a welded diff so
100<00:01:10.409> hundred<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.090> tennis<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
100 hundred there you go the tennis and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050 
100 hundred there you go the tennis and
then<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> nismo<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.490> 46<00:01:14.880> feet

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
then i use the nismo we have 46 feet

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.679 
then i use the nismo we have 46 feet
crossed<00:01:15.890> mission<00:01:16.890> yeah<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.000> i<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> one

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
crossed mission yeah that i use that one

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
crossed mission yeah that i use that one
for<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> transmission<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> weight

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
for the transmission you can do a weight

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.190 
for the transmission you can do a weight
reduction<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> cool<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.049> make<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
reduction which is cool you can make a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
reduction which is cool you can make a
lighter<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.530> heavier<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
lighter or heavier and you get the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350 
lighter or heavier and you get the
lights<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> options<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> stuff<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> it's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
lights and options and stuff and it's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
lights and options and stuff and it's
just<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.600> good<00:01:27.780> card<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> physics<00:01:28.680> are

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
just a really good card the physics are

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.630 
just a really good card the physics are
great<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> drifting

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
great but i will say that drifting

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
great but i will say that drifting
wasn't<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> great<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.170> mainly<00:01:35.070> because

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
wasn't that great from me mainly because

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.330 
wasn't that great from me mainly because
the<00:01:35.820> track<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.689> drifted<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> who<00:01:38.009> gave<00:01:38.189> me

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the track that I drifted on who gave me

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
the track that I drifted on who gave me
a<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.640> frame<00:01:38.880> rate<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.110> jumping<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
a bit of frame rate so it was jumping I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.649 
a bit of frame rate so it was jumping I
don't<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.220> dress<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> frame<00:01:42.420> rate<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
don't I don't dress for the frame rate I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.679 
don't I don't dress for the frame rate I
never<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.259> had<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.180> but<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.299> i<00:01:45.360> record

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
never have had to and but when i record

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
never have had to and but when i record
i<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.899> frame<00:01:46.049> rate<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:47.520> wasn't<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> good

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
i get frame rate so it wasn't that good

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.920 
i get frame rate so it wasn't that good
and<00:01:49.909> something<00:01:50.909> weird<00:01:51.210> happened<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and something weird happened in the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
so I don't know if it really makes a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.960 
so I don't know if it really makes a
difference<00:02:35.170> or<00:02:35.470> not<00:02:35.500> Oh<00:02:35.770> auto<00:02:36.310> clutch<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.820> see

physics<00:04:45.010> are<00:04:45.159> wonderful<00:04:45.909> and<00:04:46.199> very<00:04:47.400> realistic

physics are wonderful and very realistic
so<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:49.750> think<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.110> might<00:04:50.199> be<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.320> bug<00:04:50.620> oh<00:04:50.860> here

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
so I think it might be a bug oh here

confused why does it you wanted to come
off<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.490> ground<00:05:00.760> like<00:05:00.909> that<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.659> when<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.810> did

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
off the ground like that and when I did

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.589 
off the ground like that and when I did
my<00:05:02.050> will<00:05:02.470> twitch<00:05:02.860> really<00:05:03.310> hard<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.449> was

fine like it was easy and then the
frankness<00:06:40.830> comes<00:06:41.830> that<00:06:42.069> when<00:06:42.159> I<00:06:42.219> start

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
frankness comes that when I start
