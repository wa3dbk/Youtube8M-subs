00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.049
 good afternoon friends on this occasion 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'm going to prepare some delicious on 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 purple with a little rice 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.100
 you knew it comes from the Aztecs but 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.320
 they called him die and later 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.480
 you are going to see a fact about it 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.990
 well, we go in parts to prepare the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 mole let's use 200 grams 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.340
 of mole that here we are going to use 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.850
 also 50 grams of peanut paste 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.540
 and 20 grams of chocolate preferable than 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 uses is chocolate granny 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 we are also going to use half a liter of 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.340
 chicken broth and half a liter of water 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 we're going to expect this to fall apart 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.170
 to see if it stays a little too 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.699
 very thick in thick because 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.699
 we reduce with a little water 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.750
 Here I already have the chicken ready for 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.210
 pillows 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.640
 and here is the mole already more or less 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.550
 dissolved but if you realize it has a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.280
 lots of lumps to remove from these 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.290
 groups let's do the following 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.630
 space nothing else we're going to use a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.689
 balloon 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.039
 and then do so and return alone the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.039
 eggs are going to fall apart 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.930
 as the lumps are falling apart 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.289
 the consistency becomes thicker 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.829
 of the mole so that's why it's 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:54.030
 important that 2 of 250 grams of mole 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.909
 you are a liter of water 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.460
 and hopefully the rest of the water is not going to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.150
 to be perfect this is the measure 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.080
 perfect now that if you want to double 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.360
 that amount 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.869
 nothing more to throw double the mole and the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.869
 double water 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.660
 and it looked good 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.080
 because the mole has already been good, it does not have 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.950
 lumps and has to be left with this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.950
 consistency 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.580
 although aguadito immediately we are going to 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.710
 sancochar three tortillas depending on 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.710
 how many berries 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.400
 well, here we have the tortillas 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.900
 sancochadas remember that oil is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.470
 only to make the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.810
 the tortilla and do not fall apart 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.900
 it's a good idea to put a little bit of mole 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.300
 inside so they are juicy to the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.740
 time of 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.170
 to bite the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.040
 also another important fact we are going to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.310
 put a mold mirror on those 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.120
 tell us gastronomic to be 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.450
 Well well distributed mold 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.680
 Here are the bolts ready 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.160
 I put rice as a garnish and now we're going 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.160
 to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.319
 when you're brown 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.410
 Lets put 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.410
 minced onion 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.910
 and almost everything 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.420
 you can also put cream for that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.349
 optionality depends on how you like it 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.690
 and that's how good friends are, because I hope that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.290
 have you liked this recipe share 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.920
 the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.189
 and then later I'll put more 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.030
 recipes for your taste until then friends 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.030
 bless you
