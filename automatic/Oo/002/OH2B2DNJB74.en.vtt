At Kimball Midwest we consider it part of
our mission to educate our customers on

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.130
the proper use of our products. Today
we're going to be covering the proper

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.500
use of spray paints. Let's start with the
basics, surface prep. To get a good paint

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
adhesion you want to make sure you have
a clean, grease free surface.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.359
You got glossy or hard surfaces you'll
want to sand those down a little bit.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.410
Second the paint, the pigments, resins,
and solvents, well they can tend to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
separate over time. To have an excellent
quality paint job you want to ensure

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
that all are mixed properly. You want to
start by swirling the can till you hear

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.579
the metal on metal contact of the ball
bearing. Now shake the can for at least

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.050
one minute. Now you'll want to use a
watch when timing this out, a minute will

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.649
take a lot longer than you think it will.
Now third, when you lay down your first

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.980
coat you want to take a look at the
instructions on the back of the can. It's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.609
going to tell you how far away from your
project you need to hold your can when

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.140
you're painting. In this case, Ultra Pro
Max Paint specifies a spray distance

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.980
of eight to ten inches which is just a
little bit smaller than the size of the can.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.440
Hold the can on the surface,
rotate the can ninety degrees, and you're

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.939
ready to paint. And fourth, when you start
painting, start and finish off the edge

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.720
of your project. If you have gunk or air
in the spray can this will keep it off

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.650
of your project when you start spraying.
When you finish it will help avoid any

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.049
uneven spots. Now fifth, you don't want to
over spray, now if you do feel the need

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.600
for multiple coats you want to provide a
thin tack adhesion first before coming

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.740
back over with your final coat. Start
with a thin tack layer to promote good

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.509
adhesion give it a few minutes for the
solvent to evaporate, then follow up with

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.630
the finish coat. Using multiple finish
coats without a tack coat and waiting

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
for the paint to dry in between each
pass well that's just going to waste a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.390
lot of paint and a lot of time. Sixth
when you're done painting turn your can

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
over and spray till clear, now that will
keep the paint from clogging up in the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.710
paint nozzle and also ruining a good can
of paint. Let's do a quick review

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.260
prep your surface, make sure it's clean,
and scuff up glossy or hard surfaces.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.190
Swirl till you hear metal then shake for
at least a minute. Look at the paint can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.700
instructions and paint from the
recommended distance. Start and stop

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
painting off the edge of your project.
Don't over spray, lay down a tack coat

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.120
wait a few minutes then paint your final
coat. And when you're done turn the can

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.160
over and spray till clear. Now if you use
these recommendations you'll get a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.940
smooth, long-lasting finish from your
Kimball Midwest paints.
