cast in this image I've added a blue

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.210 
cast in this image I've added a blue
cast<00:00:26.600> to<00:00:26.870> make<00:00:27.050> this<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.289> little<00:00:27.500> more<00:00:27.620> obvious

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220

cast to make this a little more obvious
in<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.490> video<00:00:29.619> I'll<00:00:30.619> choose<00:00:30.980> remove<00:00:31.280> color

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
in the video I'll choose remove color

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.760 
in the video I'll choose remove color
cast<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.300> click<00:00:32.539> on<00:00:32.570> an<00:00:32.809> area<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.410> cloud

cast and click on an area of this cloud

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.760 
cast and click on an area of this cloud
it<00:00:34.250> should<00:00:34.550> be<00:00:34.579> gray

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.780 

that<00:00:39.770> one<00:00:40.070> click<00:00:40.400> removes<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.060> blue<00:00:41.240> cast

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790

this<00:00:43.790> isn't<00:00:44.090> a<00:00:44.180> tool<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.420> use<00:00:44.630> very<00:00:45.050> often<00:00:45.320> but

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
this isn't a tool I use very often but

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.830 
this isn't a tool I use very often but
if<00:00:46.400> you<00:00:46.520> have<00:00:46.670> an<00:00:46.820> image<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:47.300> an<00:00:47.390> obvious

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
if you have an image with an obvious

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.290 
if you have an image with an obvious
color<00:00:48.080> cast<00:00:48.430> this<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.670> fix<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.090> quickly<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
color cast this can fix it quickly the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.360 
color cast this can fix it quickly the
next<00:00:53.600> command<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.080> one<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.530> I<00:00:54.590> use<00:00:54.620> very

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
next command is one that I use very

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.310 
next command is one that I use very
often<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:55.910> elements<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.020> hue

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
often in elements and that is hue

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.100 
often in elements and that is hue
saturation<00:00:58.390> I've<00:00:59.390> already<00:00:59.570> used<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.080> couple

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
saturation I've already used it a couple

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.260 
saturation I've already used it a couple
times<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.129> course<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.550> demonstrate<00:01:02.120> other

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
times in the course to demonstrate other

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.530 
times in the course to demonstrate other
functions<00:01:02.809> in<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:04.540> hue/saturation

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540

adjustment<00:01:06.160> window<00:01:07.160> we<00:01:07.910> have<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.060> menu<00:01:08.330> at<00:01:08.540> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
adjustment window we have a menu at the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.100 
adjustment window we have a menu at the
top<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.140> includes<00:01:09.560> master<00:01:10.570> which<00:01:11.570> means<00:01:11.840> all

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
top that includes master which means all

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.460 
top that includes master which means all
colors<00:01:12.619> are<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.950> full<00:01:13.160> image<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.470> then

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
colors are the full image and then

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.120 
colors are the full image and then
there's<00:01:15.740> individual<00:01:16.310> colors<00:01:16.729> under<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:18.130> I'm

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
there's individual colors under that I'm

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.109 
there's individual colors under that I'm
going<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.400> keep<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.670> set<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:19.970> master<00:01:20.540> right<00:01:20.750> now

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
going to keep it set on master right now

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.090 
going to keep it set on master right now
when<00:01:23.119> i<00:01:23.149> move<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.570> hue<00:01:23.810> slider<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.770> colors

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100

for the entire image shift this is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.800 
for the entire image shift this is
essentially<00:01:29.810> like<00:01:29.840> turning<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.470> color<00:01:30.649> wheel

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810

the colorize checkbox makes the image

the colorize checkbox makes the image
monotone<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:19.850> set<00:02:20.300> what<00:02:20.510> color<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
monotone I can then set what color and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.050 
monotone I can then set what color and
how<00:02:21.380> saturated<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.220> color<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.550> with<00:02:22.940> the

how saturated that color is with the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.910 
how saturated that color is with the
sliders<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> highly<00:02:27.650> saturated

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
sliders so this is a highly saturated

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.600 
sliders so this is a highly saturated
