00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.929
 hello and welcome I'm jeans 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
 francois bonnet professor of drums 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 at carp sharp today we're going 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 to approach the techniques of ben ali 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.880
 so the balls and it's really 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 something it's a universe it's 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 really there are plenty of techniques 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.119
 different 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 then we will immediately start 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 by the first sailing technique then 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.000
 this first technique so she 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 actually is to make a circle with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 the left hand and we will actually fight 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.850
 each every circle goes this pace and in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.140
 a function of time whose ca makes 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.380
 crash 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.930
 2 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.160
 and the right hand ll will sweep the top 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.090
 of the crate of that so both 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 combined it gives that 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.730
 so that's what these are techniques that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.460
 are used mainly in the 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.280
 jazz then also we can add the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.280
 ternary feeling in this sweeping 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 so that's adding that little bit 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.470
 we will give the ternary feeling 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.210
 so now we'll see another 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.500
 technique where this time we will not 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 do circles but robin all 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.620
 simply cross your hands doing 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.620
 back and forth 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.409
 so here we can add some 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.840
 little feeling of grandson 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.840
 small emphasis like this 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.540
 so that's how I come from 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.000
 do and well actually we can always 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.130
 add this tata and that gives the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.080
 thread the ternary feeling we will see a 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.970
 yet another technique where this time 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 we always go with the hand 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.140
 left 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.360
 circles and on the right hand by 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.630
 against we will draw neighborhoods of 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.550
 Moon 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.550
 that's how it works 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.160
 then there is also a technique that we 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 uses particularly on 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.300
 ballads and which consists in making 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.830
 circles simply with the two 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.540
 hands like these and we will make a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.540
 accent each at each turn 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.829
 we will illustrate her with music 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.829
 now we are 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.510
 all 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.510
 trivago 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.640
 rabies 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.940
 that's actually in terms of 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.440
 techniques we will use 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.910
 well we get different sounds 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.590
 that's what's interesting it's 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.180
 see know a little bit different 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.090
 techniques and that we will be able to adapt 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.560
 to the context of the piece then the balls 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.510
 and well we can use them as well 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.830
 in jazz but also in different 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.620
 styles and that's what we will have 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.090
 So now then when in the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.549
 use in jazz and well we will 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.730
 rather used so the techniques that 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.470
 just seen previously 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.060
 when used in other 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.360
 styles we may be rather trendy 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.620
 to play by placing using the all 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.000
 simply bullets and valleys 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.000
 as if they were chopsticks 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.830
 here you have tried on your side 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.870
 different techniques do not hesitate to 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.729
 play this video and then 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.650
 work at the same time and I tell you 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.650
 See you soon on Quartier Diez
