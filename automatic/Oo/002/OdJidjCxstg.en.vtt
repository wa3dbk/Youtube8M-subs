00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.110
 Maybe in the meeting 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.879
 show even more uphill trend 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 At first, however, the first was outside 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.099
 precisely also very freely shown then but 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 showed the horse galloping in the second outside 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.379
 and also after the explained wanted at k 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 that is able to assemble 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.880
 to leave 80 the impression as to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.170
 the permeability becomes positive 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 influenced by the uniform 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 following the obedience of the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 Looseness of the field 8,0 and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.239
 Overall, the horse seems to us on the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 Right way of education 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.899
 Regarding the criteria of the scale of the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.660
 training 82 for a total value of 7.92 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 just another Dutch couple 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 the stallion expression my son is like 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.700
 continued to miss out on a tiny long 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.629
 but that's really uplifting 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.190
 words and yes you ever on the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.379
 right way is it is actually 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 you can look good in the future and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.060
 here the next gallops in the galloping 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 train it is expression a kwp n stallion 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 from vivaldi to a vincent mother 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 he was pulled by gw van hove it is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.619
 also the owner is stallion and im 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 saddle sits title track of silk road 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.970
 from the Netherlands 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 he is already very expressive 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 long 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.619
 So all in all it is a stallion and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.969
 I think he is not so im 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.640
 hang streep standing as first very much 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.960
 very bad and will certainly be so 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.879
 a bit in his body pure 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.790
 to grow 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.790
 there are already so pretty teen 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.790
 find 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.019
 yesterday the two were in 29th place 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.830
 What's with a truck now ? 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.049
 we see here 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.790
 he was rated with a 8.0 but 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.410
 rather, on the step so he was already 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.299
 quite hesitant and excited 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.099
 Did not really want the last one 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.180
 go step 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.500
 this is what he calls here already 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.480
 bit through the square seasonally 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.799
 curious who is still such a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.150
 a bit to rest one finds very 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.150
 expressive drives 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.250
 very elastic 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:49.190
 the first students in front at that time in front of him 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:51.460
 so happens when you step backwards in 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.100
 that really occurred 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.700
 I hope he has not done anything 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.290
 here comes to falling and because he plant the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.610
 Of course, leaving is also over 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.050
 with the exam I hope he has 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.150
 nothing more than watching everyone 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.830
 in any case, after that he completely 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.280
 normal on so now would not be in the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.280
 foot up or something like that 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.590
 obviously more scary than that 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.590
 really what happens
