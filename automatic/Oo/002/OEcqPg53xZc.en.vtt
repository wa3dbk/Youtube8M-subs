00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 so I present you my girard 50 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 so that's not the copy but basically 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 it's the same as the derbi drd xtreme of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.969
 at derbi 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.350
 so to tell you airbus general 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.100
 are associated they made the same bike 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.960
 up to the colomb there that actually changes 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.240
 simply 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.050
 so I'm going to take black 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 it's the opponent because on the screen t 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 I do not show you my plate 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 registration draws here I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.380
 cut the bib to that because 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.940
 it's like that maybe it will change 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.809
 also the retro them the declinatory I 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 to say since finally in the future has rained 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 all access to do any time yeah 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 still all of Persian origin to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 stickers I love you so that's it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 may not change there instead she 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 not too dirty it's a karcher 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 day before yesterday but good as I do 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 a lot of cross end it's not about 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 crop a web we can say that like that I 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.939
 make a promise a lot the impediment 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 euros with a mehdi italy after retro 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.759
 that still a little bit all round be a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:32.930
 problem it does not bother that's so done 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:32.930
 just listen to the noise we put the ignition 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.610
 just go first in fact I'm 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.610
 a bit on a slope 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.479
 that's the sound of action 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.729
 still bridled unfair like that again 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.070
 bridled because that's a thousand seven hundred 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.930
 thirty kilometers but but good the game 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.890
 reduced to unleash before but the guy who 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.369
 makes me go on vacation so we 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 will talk about that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.620
 I'm not disappointed with the noise since the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.240
 makes a rather quiet noise actually it's 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.770
 not too much noise I like it I do not 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.950
 want to make a hell of a racket actually 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.950
 tech 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:43.090
 here is to be able to apply horn 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.550
 so the goods actually because lula 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 was of course well 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.200
 in the ribs and or motor it is 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.830
 good everything is good so the projects that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.410
 i have that i actually i'm going 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.820
 certainly certainly before Cecile 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.420
 hÃ©neault sure change this pole so has the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.960
 original pot 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.600
 we will remove it we will keep it we will 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.390
 to put a pot yasuni the racing I think 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.780
 too much koala that tells me so this morning 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 for yasuni it is in my opinion a good pot 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.410
 I drink too much what was a story 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.430
 crossing to both bands also from 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.170
 curvature and it's for the rains 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.210
 do not really touch what apparently 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.510
 it was pulling well he told me I would double 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.240
 the speed by two finally I'm my 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.090
 speed up a street roughly at this 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:42.450
 jewel if I go up to 55 on the flat so 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:45.170
 actual speed 50 that where it gets 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.170
 see everywhere 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.810
 so here and then apparently with the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.480
 pouilly and sony i was showing to without a 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.150
 priori something in there then 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.140
 unchanged sprinklers and then the sprocket 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.959
 I do not think I change because 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.840
 apparently the opinion if we changed 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.000
 after to do for the cross serra 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.350
 if not it's not terrible so we 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.550
 a small chest I do not say feet 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.680
 in and then and so here is so is 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.070
 brand new I bought them a month ago a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.350
 month and a half earlier so here is a 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.669
 little customization canada it's 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.350
 like that I have family at 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.780
 Canada 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.640
 short so that will be all for this video 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.480
 therefore also had to go and serious 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.980
 not want too much my little helmet glas 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.440
 especially also I'm not even that the 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.930
 equipment 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.780
 they adapted since I'm with a 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.610
 phone yeah good camera what 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.350
 is subject to pros but remains at the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.450
 House 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.800

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.500
