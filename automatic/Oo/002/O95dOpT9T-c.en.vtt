a test ride although it costs a little
bit<00:05:08.560> more<00:05:08.650> we<00:05:09.029> definitely<00:05:10.029> think<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.539> the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
bit more we definitely think that the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.749 
bit more we definitely think that the
performance<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.710> worth<00:05:12.039> it<00:05:12.219> especially<00:05:12.310> when

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
performance is worth it especially when

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.760 
performance is worth it especially when
you<00:05:12.879> consider<00:05:12.969> how<00:05:13.330> lights<00:05:13.629> bike<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.199> and<00:05:14.379> just

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you consider how lights bike is and just

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:26.300 
you consider how lights bike is and just
the<00:05:14.919> added<00:05:15.219> versatility<00:05:15.699> that<00:05:16.300> brings<00:05:16.599> tire

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310
