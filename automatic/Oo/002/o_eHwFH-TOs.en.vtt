00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
not something that you would have to do

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450

I<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.320> skip<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.980> step<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> feel

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
I would skip this step because I feel

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.760 
I would skip this step because I feel
like<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.690> need<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
with some powder because if I do not do

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.470 
with some powder because if I do not do
this<00:01:50.350> step<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.340> will<00:01:51.610> not<00:01:51.790> believe<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
this step you will not believe I
