00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.270
 serious 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.270
 Hello 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.450
 one arrives late one day and also came to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.580
 to be invented a baby shower 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
 I had thought of giving them a little 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 I review because there are still mares and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.280
 donkeys writing Congo people are 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 writing badly and there and there and there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.260
 putting the h where he gives them his damn 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.510
 Earn like that pod here did not come out 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.370
 while I wanted to give them a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.039
 feedback on the topics already 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.129
 mentioned I have found actions 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.070
 specific mares and donkeys have 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.969
 evolved to devil animal mega and 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 has damn imbecile animal look at this 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 Photo 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 you believe that this is possible my 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.080
 angel comforts angel why there is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.420
 people dying from hypertension 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.060
 animals that want like that you think it's 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 impossible and look at this other image 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.630
 she is glad that she fell 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 of the engine and one leg was disrupted and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 hey what she says and I want my engine to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.280
 despite the path that there had to be water 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.310
 and that's really because I know her 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 and I know where he lives and not like you who 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.430
 they catch and they make nonsense and writing 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.310
 and what about the program is not going to be 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 the next photo 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.370
 Oh no 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.250
 Oh 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.250
 and that what I what distinguishes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.119
 efe 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.179
 that takes many turns to leave 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.880
 and open that but what about the people 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.319
 but I said that is world gives many 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.050
 turns and better 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.040
 and what he says 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.590
 they think I'm eating it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 it's better to let the world take you 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.650
 as it must be, she must come 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.250
 devil and his father eyes and cut him the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.530
 loteta and what the devil takes 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.360
 cursed will carries devil but 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.360
 because you are animals 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.780
 I am going to take my dog easy 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.290
