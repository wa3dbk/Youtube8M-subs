actually water that flows over a glass

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.460 
actually water that flows over a glass
window<00:03:18.670> basically<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.200> sight

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
window basically so you get the sight

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.100 
and the sound of a gently flowing water
and<00:03:23.740> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.670> adds<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.930> whole

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
and I think that just adds to the whole

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.740 
and I think that just adds to the whole
pampering<00:03:27.070> experience<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.910> taking<00:03:28.510> about

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
pampering experience of taking about

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.220
