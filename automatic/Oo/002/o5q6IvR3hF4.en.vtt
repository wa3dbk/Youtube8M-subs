00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the small winners who could 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
 after being the future of the existing one is 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.880
 because not a small Magellanic the month 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 Magellanic that surprise networks 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 social when this video was recorded this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.059
 boy was 8 years old is playing against 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 children that evidently several of them 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.250
 they are bigger than him and it surprises the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.830
 ball's handling of its age is 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 very skillful particularly skillful but 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 also note that the ball takes her 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 always stuck to the foot does not escape 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 this is never slow in that it is pure 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.489
 talent being viewed such 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 of turns at that age and that domain of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.710
 ball is not normal as logical good what 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.969
 remove the incredibly technical player 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.969
 for your for your age 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.250
 really this looks like it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.290
 reinstalled after a while look at it 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.300
 play and incredible how you play you know 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.730
 which is because they made a note in a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.340
 diary of espaÃ±a.el daily corts that is 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.900
 a newspaper dedicated to sports were 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.239
 they who started calling it that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.490
 like the 'messi chileno or the month and the month 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.500
 and d 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.920
 of magallanes the sporty sokol of the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 city of mind is 8 years old so there 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.760
 we see it 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 let's remember him because the next few years 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.440
 we could see it on the court maybe 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.150
 wearing the 'red' shirt you will see 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.760
 how to lift the ball and that is very 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.530
 well really very good besides that is 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.630
 as brave as he dares to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.710
 good balls the recovered 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.240
 He was very, very good at good passes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.860
 I'm really surprised that you have that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 example that intelligence to give passes 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.700
 because at that age children try to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.860
 pass it on to everyone and do it with them 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.470
 only at 8 years old and that set the mood 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.479
 children nephews are going to know that this way 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.420
 there is the ability for example give a pass 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.180
 of a partner converts to 8 years 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.610
 well fine well weird 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.050
 there is another great pass looks left left alone 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.090
 a companion 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 now really go very well look what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 good 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.600
 it accelerates
