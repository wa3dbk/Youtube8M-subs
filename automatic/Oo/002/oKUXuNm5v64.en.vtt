00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
has a few h of things thrown in there

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
has a few h of things thrown in there
like<00:01:50.960> alpha<00:01:51.380> para<00:01:51.619> casi<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.220> oestrogen<00:01:52.850> as

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
like alpha para casi and oestrogen as

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240 
like alpha para casi and oestrogen as
well<00:01:53.210> for<00:01:54.170> those<00:01:54.260> who<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.619> are<00:01:54.860> familiar<00:01:55.070> with

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
well for those who you are familiar with

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.990 
well for those who you are familiar with
it<00:01:55.670> basically<00:01:56.030> helps<00:01:56.420> with<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.869> absorption

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
it basically helps with the absorption

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.999 
it basically helps with the absorption
process<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.509> nutrients<00:02:00.380> into<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.680> cells

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
process of the nutrients into the cells

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.249 
process of the nutrients into the cells
and<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.520> basically<00:02:02.090> through<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.600> intestines

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
and and basically through the intestines

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.710 
and and basically through the intestines
as<00:02:03.439> well<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.490> very<00:02:04.729> solid<00:02:05.090> supplement

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
as well so it's a very solid supplement

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.570 
as well so it's a very solid supplement

all know that creatine helps build
muscle<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.030> said<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.960> something

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
muscle so with that said it's something

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.440 
muscle so with that said it's something
you<00:02:42.410> need<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.460> your<00:02:43.640> diet<00:02:43.790> plan<00:02:43.970> in

you need to have in your diet plan in

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.630 
you need to have in your diet plan in
your<00:02:44.480> supplement<00:02:45.140> stack<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.370> looking

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
your supplement stack if you're looking

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640 
your supplement stack if you're looking
to<00:02:46.790> increase<00:02:47.090> lean<00:02:47.660> muscle<00:02:47.990> tissue<00:02:48.020> properly

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
to increase lean muscle tissue properly

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.770 
to increase lean muscle tissue properly
increase<00:02:49.100> strength<00:02:49.430> increase<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.300> covering

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
increase strength increase your covering

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.230 
increase strength increase your covering
and<00:02:51.020> basically<00:02:51.590> take<00:02:52.580> yourself<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.120> next

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
and basically take yourself to the next

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.930 
and basically take yourself to the next
step<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.990> creatine<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.890> not<00:02:55.310> something<00:02:55.760> that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
step so creatine is not something that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.390 
step so creatine is not something that
you<00:02:56.060> don't<00:02:56.330> want<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:56.870> use<00:02:56.930> it's<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.740> bad

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
you don't want to not use it's got bad

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.250 
you don't want to not use it's got bad
reviews<00:02:58.520> you're<00:02:59.180> blowing<00:02:59.570> noise<00:02:59.810> or<00:03:00.050> stuff
