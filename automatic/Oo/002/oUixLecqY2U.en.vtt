position was where she was going to be
comfortable<00:00:32.090> we<00:00:33.090> relax<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> muscles<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.350> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
comfortable we relax the muscles then we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
comfortable we relax the muscles then we
took<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> bite<00:00:34.860> registration<00:00:35.059> we<00:00:36.059> waxed<00:00:36.480> her

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
took a bite registration we waxed her

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
took a bite registration we waxed her
whole<00:00:36.750> case<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.340> put<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
whole case up and then we put all the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
whole case up and then we put all the
parts<00:00:39.390> together<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.800> have

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
quite ill six months into it I could not
stand<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.630> even<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> work<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.829> was

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
stand to even go to work because I was

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.030 
stand to even go to work because I was
having<00:01:59.189> real<00:01:59.969> severe<00:02:00.719> bad<00:02:00.990> headache<00:02:01.469> any<00:02:01.680> time

having real severe bad headache any time

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.920 
having real severe bad headache any time
that<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.729> walk<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.390> dentist's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that I would walk into a dentist's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.449 
that I would walk into a dentist's
office<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.549> cringe

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
office I would really cringe

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
office I would really cringe
hyperventilate<00:02:08.899> press<00:02:09.899> spire<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> first

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
hyperventilate press spire when I first

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970 
hyperventilate press spire when I first
walked<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.239> i<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.690> filling<00:02:13.260> all<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
walked in i was filling all of the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.640 
walked in i was filling all of the
that<00:02:14.099> when<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> walked<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.989> got<00:02:16.170> into<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that when I walked into it got into the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.770 
that when I walked into it got into the
chair<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> told<00:02:17.459> him<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.790> cannot<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.629> my

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
chair I told him you cannot go in my

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.289 
chair I told him you cannot go in my
mouth<00:02:18.989> at<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.799> cannot<00:02:20.129> at<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.640> point<00:02:21.000> he

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
mouth at all you cannot at that point he

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.170 
mouth at all you cannot at that point he
built<00:02:21.989> up<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> relationship<00:02:22.650> where<00:02:23.640> he<00:02:23.849> said

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
built up the relationship where he said

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
built up the relationship where he said
I<00:02:24.360> don't<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> go<00:02:25.049> in<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.319> mouth<00:02:25.500> right

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I don't have to go in your mouth right

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.250 
I don't have to go in your mouth right
now<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.239> pretty<00:02:27.510> good<00:02:27.629> because<00:02:27.930> he

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
now so that was pretty good because he

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
now so that was pretty good because he
didn't<00:02:28.530> push<00:02:28.709> himself<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.640> me<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.599> say<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.260> have

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
didn't push himself on me to say we have

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.430 
didn't push himself on me to say we have
to<00:02:31.709> do<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.940> able<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.269> correct<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.930> he

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
to do this to be able to correct it he

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
to do this to be able to correct it he
at<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.040> point<00:02:35.549> let<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.940> feel<00:02:36.180> comfortable

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
at that point let me feel comfortable

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.479 
at that point let me feel comfortable
with<00:02:37.170> him<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.129> are<00:02:38.190> several<00:02:38.310> reasons

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
with him well there are several reasons

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.430 
with him well there are several reasons
when<00:02:39.030> she<00:02:39.269> did<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.569> an<00:02:39.690> infection<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.319> her

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
when she did have an infection in her

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.750 
when she did have an infection in her
sinus<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.310> could<00:02:41.579> have<00:02:41.670> been

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
sinus and that could have been

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.100 
sinus and that could have been
contributing<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> headache<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:42.989> we

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
contributing to the headache so we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.960 
contributing to the headache so we
cleared<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.430> think<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.849> more

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
cleared that up but I think the more

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.430 
cleared that up but I think the more
important<00:02:45.420> thing<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:46.049> use<00:02:46.230> some

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
important thing was we use some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.380 
important thing was we use some
neuromuscular<00:02:47.220> techniques<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.879> her<00:02:48.030> well<00:02:48.269> we

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
neuromuscular techniques out her well we

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.720 
neuromuscular techniques out her well we
relax<00:02:48.989> your<00:02:49.200> jaw<00:02:49.349> muscles<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.310> found<00:02:50.579> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
relax your jaw muscles and found the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.150 
relax your jaw muscles and found the
correct<00:02:51.060> position<00:02:51.269> for<00:02:51.959> her<00:02:52.109> jaws<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:53.010> other

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
correct position for her jaws in other

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190 
correct position for her jaws in other
words<00:02:53.400> her<00:02:53.519> muscles<00:02:53.940> are<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.390> more<00:02:54.660> relaxed

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
words her muscles are in a more relaxed

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.979 
words her muscles are in a more relaxed
position<00:02:55.349> now<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.670> ends<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.690> whole

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
position now and that ends that whole

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.770 
position now and that ends that whole
cycle<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.730> muscle<00:02:59.730> tension<00:02:59.940> headache<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.480> think

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
cycle of muscle tension headache I think

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780 
cycle of muscle tension headache I think
most<00:03:01.079> headaches<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.920> muscle<00:03:02.549> tension

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
most headaches are muscle tension

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.839 
most headaches are muscle tension
headaches<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.900> has<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.680> with<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.190> job

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
headaches and it has to do with the job

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.910 
headaches and it has to do with the job
being<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.359> wrong<00:03:06.480> position<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.709> put

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
being in the wrong position so we put

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.680 
being in the wrong position so we put
the<00:03:08.099> John<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.790> correct<00:03:09.030> position<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.510> more

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the John the correct position or more

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.210 
the John the correct position or more
importantly<00:03:10.410> where<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> muscles<00:03:11.099> are

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
importantly where the muscles are

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.940 
importantly where the muscles are
relaxed<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.970> therefore<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.930> lot<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.590> things

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
relaxed and therefore a lot of things

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.619 
relaxed and therefore a lot of things
just<00:03:14.310> eliminate<00:03:14.849> things<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.299> we<00:03:15.420> don't<00:03:15.480> even

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
just eliminate things that we don't even

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.080 
just eliminate things that we don't even
know<00:03:15.900> about<00:03:15.930> sometimes<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.519> people

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
know about sometimes like this people

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.180 
know about sometimes like this people
come<00:03:18.389> back<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:19.200> what<00:03:19.410> she<00:03:19.560> first<00:03:19.769> came<00:03:19.950> in

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
come back that's what she first came in

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.979 
come back that's what she first came in
we<00:03:20.340> were<00:03:20.489> talking<00:03:21.060> about<00:03:21.180> headaches<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.870> would

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
we were talking about headaches we would

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.690 
we were talking about headaches we would
not<00:03:22.109> get<00:03:22.290> about<00:03:22.410> other<00:03:22.680> issues<00:03:22.709> these<00:03:23.489> are

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
not get about other issues these are

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.059 
not get about other issues these are
side<00:03:23.970> things<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.510> people<00:03:24.750> tell<00:03:25.019> me<00:03:25.069> they

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
side things that people tell me they

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.890 
side things that people tell me they
come<00:03:26.280> back<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.609> they<00:03:26.700> say<00:03:26.880> wow<00:03:27.269> my<00:03:27.540> headaches

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
come back and they say wow my headaches

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.050 
come back and they say wow my headaches
are<00:03:28.049> gone<00:03:28.230> right<00:03:29.010> my<00:03:29.250> neck<00:03:29.459> aches<00:03:29.700> are<00:03:29.880> gone

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
are gone right my neck aches are gone

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.879 
are gone right my neck aches are gone
and<00:03:30.510> they<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.959> feel<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.440> much<00:03:31.560> better<00:03:31.829> about

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
and they just feel so much better about

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.030 
and they just feel so much better about
I<00:03:32.190> would<00:03:32.250> say<00:03:32.599> less<00:03:33.599> than<00:03:33.630> 1%<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.530> dentists<00:03:34.980> are

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
I would say less than 1% of dentists are

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.069 
I would say less than 1% of dentists are
trained<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.730> neuromuscular<00:03:36.630> techniques

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
trained to do neuromuscular techniques

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.849 
trained to do neuromuscular techniques
most<00:03:37.590> dentists<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.130> even<00:03:38.459> know<00:03:38.669> about<00:03:38.700> it

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
most dentists don't even know about it

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.409
