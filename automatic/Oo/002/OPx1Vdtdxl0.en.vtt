available<00:00:22.170> because<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> noticed<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
available because I noticed that the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.390 
available because I noticed that the
branding<00:00:23.789> agency<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.750> picardy<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> don't

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
branding agency is picardy so I don't

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
branding agency is picardy so I don't
know<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.519> they're<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:27.000> own<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.390> brand<00:00:27.599> if

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
know if they're they own the brand if

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
know if they're they own the brand if
they<00:00:28.199> are<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.619> brand<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.429> got<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
they are the brand it's just got it a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
they are the brand it's just got it a
different<00:00:30.539> name<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.470> kind<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
different name on it so you kind of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
different name on it so you kind of
don't<00:00:32.460> associate<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.329> since<00:00:33.600> picardie<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
don't associate them since picardie is

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.139 
don't associate them since picardie is
more<00:00:35.130> associated<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.790> wrong<00:00:37.219> whatever<00:00:38.219> it's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
more associated with wrong whatever it's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
more associated with wrong whatever it's
clear<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> silver<00:00:40.620> tequila<00:00:42.770> it's
