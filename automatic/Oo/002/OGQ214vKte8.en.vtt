00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.030 
to read and discover you know in each
poet<00:00:46.180> leads<00:00:46.360> you<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.629> another<00:00:46.870> one<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:47.649> think

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
poet leads you to another one so I think

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.440 
poet leads you to another one so I think

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
growing old and and growing up which are

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190 
growing old and and growing up which are
sometimes<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.180> same<00:01:16.390> sometimes<00:01:16.689> different

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
sometimes the same sometimes different

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.740 
sometimes the same sometimes different
and<00:01:17.439> being<00:01:18.189> alone<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.939> sort<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.270> enjoying

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
and being alone and sort of enjoying

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
and being alone and sort of enjoying
being<00:01:20.080> alone<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.680> also<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.670> sadness<00:01:21.939> that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
being alone and also the sadness that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.450 
being alone and also the sadness that
comes<00:01:22.450> with<00:01:22.630> losing<00:01:23.470> people<00:01:23.830> so<00:01:24.009> I<00:01:24.040> think<00:01:24.159> that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
comes with losing people so I think that

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.850 
comes with losing people so I think that
there<00:01:24.640> was<00:01:24.759> there's<00:01:25.180> really<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.450> sense<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:26.020> a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
there was there's really a sense of a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.609 
there was there's really a sense of a
lifespan<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.270> one<00:01:28.509> people<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:29.170> lifespan

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
lifespan in this one people a lifespan

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.920 
lifespan in this one people a lifespan
of<00:01:29.890> my<00:01:30.220> own<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.610> also<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.509> I've<00:01:31.630> watched

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
of my own but also that I've watched

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.870 
of my own but also that I've watched
people<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.860> know<00:01:32.979> as<00:01:33.100> I've<00:01:33.280> been<00:01:33.460> growing<00:01:33.759> up

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
people you know as I've been growing up

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.539 
people you know as I've been growing up
what<00:01:34.780> women<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:35.500> stages<00:01:35.829> women<00:01:36.189> go<00:01:36.310> through

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
what women what stages women go through

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.740 
what women what stages women go through
so<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.729> think<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.060> was<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.180> way<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.540> really

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so I think it was a way of really

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.590 
so I think it was a way of really
marking<00:01:38.259> marking<00:01:38.829> those<00:01:39.070> moments<00:01:39.390> well<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.450> was

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
marking marking those moments well I was

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.120 
marking marking those moments well I was
lucky<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:40.960> both<00:01:41.290> my<00:01:41.470> parents<00:01:41.829> loved<00:01:41.979> to

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
lucky because both my parents loved to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.010 
lucky because both my parents loved to
read<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.579> had<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> love<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.150> words<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.810> really

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
read and had a love of words and really

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.359 
read and had a love of words and really
believed<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.350> words<00:01:44.680> could<00:01:44.890> change<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
believed that words could change the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.039 
believed that words could change the
world<00:01:45.549> could<00:01:45.970> change<00:01:46.180> your<00:01:46.360> life<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.020> I

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
world could change your life and so I

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.889 
world could change your life and so I
really<00:01:47.409> grew<00:01:47.560> up<00:01:47.590> believing<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.780> I

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
really grew up believing that and and I

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.719 
really grew up believing that and and I
was<00:01:50.079> always<00:01:50.590> enjoyed<00:01:51.009> reading<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.490> used<00:01:51.640> to

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
was always enjoyed reading I used to

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.160 
was always enjoyed reading I used to
read<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.939> my<00:01:52.060> stuffed<00:01:52.329> animals<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:52.990> was<00:01:53.140> a

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
read to my stuffed animals when I was a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.800 
read to my stuffed animals when I was a
little<00:01:53.259> one<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.610> think<00:01:54.820> my<00:01:54.939> mother<00:01:55.180> knew<00:01:55.780> a

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
little one and I think my mother knew a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.780 
little one and I think my mother knew a
lot<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.079> poetry<00:01:56.500> when<00:01:56.649> she<00:01:56.799> was<00:01:56.920> growing<00:01:57.070> up<00:01:57.399> it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
lot of poetry when she was growing up it

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.700 
lot of poetry when she was growing up it
was<00:01:57.939> something<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.299> people<00:01:58.659> memorized<00:01:59.530> in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
was something that people memorized in

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.459 
was something that people memorized in
school<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.430> had<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> little<00:02:01.469> anthology

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
school and so you had a little anthology

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.740 
school and so you had a little anthology
of<00:02:02.500> your<00:02:02.710> own<00:02:02.860> with<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:03.430> all<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.939> time<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.479> I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
of your own with you all the time and I

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.709 
of your own with you all the time and I
think<00:02:04.810> for<00:02:05.259> me<00:02:05.409> she<00:02:06.369> encouraged<00:02:07.149> us<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.570> do

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
think for me she encouraged us to do

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.749 
think for me she encouraged us to do
that<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.259> we<00:02:08.619> were<00:02:08.979> encouraged<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.519> give

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
that in that we were encouraged to give

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.060 
that in that we were encouraged to give
her<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> poem<00:02:10.329> to<00:02:10.600> choose<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> poem<00:02:11.290> for<00:02:11.500> holidays

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
her a poem to choose a poem for holidays

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.030 
her a poem to choose a poem for holidays
or<00:02:12.100> birthdays<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.849> Mother's<00:02:13.150> Day<00:02:13.360> or

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
or birthdays or Mother's Day or

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.270 
or birthdays or Mother's Day or
and<00:02:14.159> memorize<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.939> or<00:02:15.030> copy<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and memorize it or copy it over and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.259 
and memorize it or copy it over and
decorated<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.849> that's<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.120> wonderful

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
decorated and I think that's a wonderful

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.020 
decorated and I think that's a wonderful
way<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.719> encourage<00:02:19.379> kids<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.859> explore<00:02:20.189> poetry

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
way to encourage kids to explore poetry

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.390 
way to encourage kids to explore poetry
or<00:02:21.150> reading<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.569> their<00:02:21.689> own<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.400> anything

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
or reading on their own because anything

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.709 
or reading on their own because anything
that<00:02:23.519> we<00:02:23.640> chose<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:24.090> great<00:02:24.329> didn't<00:02:24.629> matter

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
that we chose was great didn't matter

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.140 
that we chose was great didn't matter
what<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.019> was<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.379> long<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:25.799> chose<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.549> so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
what it was as long as we chose it so so

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.300 
what it was as long as we chose it so so
I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.930> got<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.469> that<00:02:28.590> habit<00:02:29.129> of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
I think that I I got into that habit of

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.619 
I think that I I got into that habit of
looking<00:02:29.790> at<00:02:30.599> poems<00:02:31.340> for<00:02:32.340> big<00:02:32.819> occasions<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
looking at poems for big occasions and

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.030 
looking at poems for big occasions and
so<00:02:33.810> when<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.049> turned<00:02:34.230> fifty<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.859> know<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

course everybody talks to you about oh
my<00:02:37.200> gosh<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.590> know<00:02:37.799> this<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.129> such<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> big<00:02:38.579> one

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
my gosh you know this is such a big one

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.119 
my gosh you know this is such a big one
this<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> big<00:02:39.359> one<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:40.650> course<00:02:40.950> it's

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
this is the big one and of course it's

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.339 
this is the big one and of course it's
not<00:02:41.280> once<00:02:41.579> it's<00:02:41.760> over<00:02:41.939> but<00:02:42.299> leading<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.049> it

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
not once it's over but leading up to it

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.250 
not once it's over but leading up to it
there's<00:02:44.069> lots<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.459> preparation<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.510> thought

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
there's lots of preparation and thought

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.050 
there's lots of preparation and thought
and<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:46.889> poetry<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.579> good<00:02:47.849> way<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and so I think poetry is a good way of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.110 
and so I think poetry is a good way of
getting<00:02:48.720> ready<00:02:49.430> I've<00:02:50.430> encouraged<00:02:50.849> my<00:02:50.970> own

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
that you've made because they really

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.740 
that you've made because they really
want<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.489> shopping<00:03:02.939> and<00:03:03.090> hopefully<00:03:03.599> you'll

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
want to go shopping and hopefully you'll

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.970 
want to go shopping and hopefully you'll
buy<00:03:03.870> them<00:03:04.079> something<00:03:04.290> while<00:03:04.680> you're<00:03:04.799> at<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
buy them something while you're at it

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.479 
buy them something while you're at it
but<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.669> think<00:03:06.359> my<00:03:06.510> children<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:07.169> have<00:03:07.980> grown

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
but I think my children have have grown

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.199 
but I think my children have have grown
up<00:03:09.590> being<00:03:10.590> exposed<00:03:10.919> to<00:03:11.159> words<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.819> reading

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
up being exposed to words and reading

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.839 
up being exposed to words and reading
and<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.409> they've<00:03:13.650> gotten<00:03:14.310> into<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> habit<00:03:14.790> of

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
and and they've gotten into the habit of

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.879 
and and they've gotten into the habit of
choosing<00:03:15.239> poems<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:15.720> us<00:03:15.870> for<00:03:16.230> Christmas<00:03:16.439> or

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
choosing poems for us for Christmas or

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.129 
choosing poems for us for Christmas or
for<00:03:17.030> birthdays<00:03:18.030> or<00:03:18.180> holidays<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:18.989> it's

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
for birthdays or holidays and so it's

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.839 
for birthdays or holidays and so it's
something<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:19.889> they've<00:03:20.069> come<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
something that I think they've come to

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.270 
something that I think they've come to
enjoy<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.419> at<00:03:21.540> least<00:03:21.690> humor<00:03:22.079> us<00:03:22.199> with<00:03:22.949> the<00:03:23.129> same

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
enjoy or at least humor us with the same

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819 
enjoy or at least humor us with the same
activity<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.060> grew<00:03:24.359> up<00:03:24.389> with<00:03:24.629> many<00:03:25.379> people

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
activity that I grew up with many people

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.530 
activity that I grew up with many people
think<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.159> poetry<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.790> isolated<00:03:27.449> in

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
think that poetry is isolated in

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.839 
think that poetry is isolated in
solitary<00:03:28.169> and<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.620> poets<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.159> isolated<00:03:29.729> in

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
solitary and that poets are isolated in

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.869 
solitary and that poets are isolated in
solitary<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.769> really<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:32.010> think<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.519> poetry

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
solitary and really I think that poetry

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.729 
solitary and really I think that poetry
is<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.090> conversation<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.229> it's<00:03:34.409> just<00:03:34.560> like

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
is a conversation and so it's just like

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.619 
is a conversation and so it's just like
talking<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> friend<00:03:35.519> or<00:03:35.879> having<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.359> friend

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
talking to a friend or having a friend

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.530 
talking to a friend or having a friend
talk<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.319> us<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:38.159> think<00:03:38.669> that's<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.359> part

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
talk to us and I think that's the part

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.330 
talk to us and I think that's the part
of<00:03:39.870> poetry<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.319> sometimes<00:03:40.859> people<00:03:41.129> miss

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
of poetry that sometimes people miss

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.240 
of poetry that sometimes people miss
it's<00:03:41.669> a<00:03:41.790> wonderful<00:03:42.299> way<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:42.979> sharing<00:03:43.979> emotions

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
it's a wonderful way of sharing emotions

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.390 
it's a wonderful way of sharing emotions
or<00:03:45.019> reflecting<00:03:46.019> on<00:03:46.139> moments<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.889> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
or reflecting on moments it's like you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.250 
or reflecting on moments it's like you
never<00:03:47.519> really<00:03:47.639> feel<00:03:48.000> alone<00:03:48.329> if<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:49.079> have

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
never really feel alone if you can have

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.809 
never really feel alone if you can have
a<00:03:49.290> conversation<00:03:49.650> with<00:03:50.129> someone<00:03:50.370> who's<00:03:50.609> been

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
a conversation with someone who's been

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.039 
a conversation with someone who's been
through<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> same<00:03:51.150> thing<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.629> you've<00:03:51.810> been

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
through the same thing that you've been

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.259 
through the same thing that you've been
through<00:03:52.169> so<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> think<00:03:52.669> often<00:03:53.669> we<00:03:53.790> feel<00:03:53.970> alone

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
through so I think often we feel alone

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.849 
through so I think often we feel alone
at<00:03:54.479> various<00:03:54.810> difficult<00:03:55.229> times<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.560> our<00:03:55.680> lives

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
at various difficult times in our lives

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.259 
at various difficult times in our lives
and<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.190> think<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.639> read<00:03:56.790> poems<00:03:57.060> about

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and I think if you read poems about

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.520 
and I think if you read poems about
people<00:03:57.599> who<00:03:57.689> have<00:03:57.780> struggled<00:03:57.989> with<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.349> same

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
people who have struggled with the same

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.920 
people who have struggled with the same
emotions<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.189> felt<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.609> same<00:03:59.790> thing<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.810> know

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
emotions or felt the same thing you know

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.839 
emotions or felt the same thing you know
you<00:04:00.989> realize<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.560> these<00:04:01.919> are<00:04:01.979> common

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
you realize that these are common

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.089 
you realize that these are common
challenges<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.419> universal<00:04:04.139> experiences<00:04:04.829> and

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
challenges and universal experiences and

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.789 
challenges and universal experiences and
reading<00:04:06.030> poems<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.479> sometimes<00:04:07.290> give<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.739> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
reading poems can sometimes give you a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.399 
reading poems can sometimes give you a
kind<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.250> new<00:04:08.370> take<00:04:08.609> on<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.879> or<00:04:09.299> make<00:04:10.259> you

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
kind of a new take on it or make you

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.479 
kind of a new take on it or make you
realize<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.739> you're<00:04:10.979> going<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.159> get<00:04:11.280> through

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
realize that you're going to get through

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.610 
realize that you're going to get through
just<00:04:11.759> like<00:04:11.819> they<00:04:12.060> did<00:04:12.299> or<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.139> gives<00:04:13.530> you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
just like they did or you know gives you

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.740 
just like they did or you know gives you
the<00:04:13.709> same<00:04:13.949> kind<00:04:14.129> of<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.879> know<00:04:14.970> sense<00:04:15.479> that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
the same kind of you know sense that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.469 
the same kind of you know sense that
other<00:04:16.019> people<00:04:16.349> enjoy<00:04:16.909> you<00:04:17.909> know<00:04:17.940> something

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
other people enjoy you know something

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.509 
other people enjoy you know something
that's<00:04:18.599> same<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.259> you<00:04:19.560> do<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.159> really<00:04:20.280> a

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
that's same as you do so it's really a

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.099 
that's same as you do so it's really a
wonderful<00:04:20.970> way<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.090> think<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.630> connecting<00:04:22.079> with

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
wonderful way I think of connecting with

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.899 
wonderful way I think of connecting with
people<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.740> being<00:04:23.190> able<00:04:23.279> to<00:04:23.430> share<00:04:23.700> things

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
people and being able to share things

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.040 
people and being able to share things
across<00:04:24.270> time

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
across time

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.980 
across time
just<00:04:25.909> you<00:04:26.909> know<00:04:27.030> with<00:04:27.270> people<00:04:27.629> who<00:04:27.720> are<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:27.930> the

same<00:04:28.169> room<00:04:28.349> as<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.680> mean<00:04:28.889> there's<00:04:29.099> poems

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.809 
I hope readers will take away from this
book<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.470> sense<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.949> women<00:04:38.129> are<00:04:38.370> awesome

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
book the sense that women are awesome

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.869 
book the sense that women are awesome
and<00:04:38.940> fantastic<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.979> that<00:04:40.979> life<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.639> keeps

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
and fantastic and that life just keeps

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.330 
and fantastic and that life just keeps
getting<00:04:42.360> better<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.690> more<00:04:43.139> varied<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.800> rich

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
getting better and more varied and rich

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.550 
getting better and more varied and rich
even<00:04:44.699> when<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.060> difficult<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.629> I<00:04:46.319> think

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
even when it's difficult and I think

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.140 
even when it's difficult and I think
it's<00:04:46.740> hopefully<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.220> book<00:04:47.460> not<00:04:47.639> just<00:04:47.699> for<00:04:48.030> women

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
it's hopefully a book not just for women

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.719 
it's hopefully a book not just for women
but<00:04:48.389> for<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.740> men<00:04:49.949> in<00:04:50.159> their<00:04:50.250> lives<00:04:50.430> as<00:04:50.699> well

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
but for the men in their lives as well

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.029 
but for the men in their lives as well
who<00:04:51.300> who<00:04:51.900> appreciate<00:04:52.409> how<00:04:52.500> awesome<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.009> are

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
who who appreciate how awesome they are

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.640 
who who appreciate how awesome they are
but<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.639> think<00:04:53.729> for<00:04:54.330> women<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.259> really<00:04:55.590> a

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
but I think for women it's really a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.709 
but I think for women it's really a
chance<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.159> realize<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:57.270> know<00:04:57.389> even<00:04:57.629> the

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
chance to realize that you know even the

chance to realize that you know even the
ordinary<00:04:57.930> moments<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:59.090> extraordinary

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
ordinary moments can be extraordinary

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.119 
ordinary moments can be extraordinary
and<00:05:00.599> I<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:00.900> by<00:05:01.050> looking<00:05:01.199> closely<00:05:01.650> at<00:05:01.860> those

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129

and I think by looking closely at those
it<00:05:02.460> gives<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:02.789> a<00:05:02.849> greater<00:05:03.270> sense<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.810> how<00:05:04.050> to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it gives you a greater sense of how to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.860 
it gives you a greater sense of how to
enjoy<00:05:04.440> your<00:05:04.710> life
