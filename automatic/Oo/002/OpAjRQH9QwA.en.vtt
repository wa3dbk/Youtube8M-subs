we're learning through 2012 right now is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.189 
we're learning through 2012 right now is
if<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.620> sensitive<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.449> energy<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> we

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if you're sensitive to the energy and we

if you're sensitive to the energy and we
all<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.910> watch<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.050> aware<00:01:01.379> of

all are to really watch and be aware of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
all are to really watch and be aware of
where<00:01:01.829> your<00:01:01.859> attentions<00:01:02.520> point<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
where your attentions point what are you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.730 
where your attentions point what are you
thinking<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.460> creating<00:01:06.240> our

Tibetan books of the Dead it talks about
this<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.909> well<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.479> we're<00:01:15.659> creating<00:01:16.200> our

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
this as well how we're creating our

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.179 
this as well how we're creating our
reality<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.900> underneath<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.009> back

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
reality and underneath just to go back

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
reality and underneath just to go back
to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.369> Carl<00:01:20.700> Jung's<00:01:21.140> underneath<00:01:22.140> the

if<00:01:28.240> we<00:01:28.420> look<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.530> course<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:30.040> miracles<00:01:30.250> or

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
if we look to the course in miracles or

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.960 
if we look to the course in miracles or
look<00:01:31.540> to<00:01:31.840> other<00:01:32.140> deeper<00:01:32.979> spiritual<00:01:33.490> channels

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
look to other deeper spiritual channels

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.950 
look to other deeper spiritual channels
at<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:35.140> Abraham<00:01:35.770> Hicks<00:01:36.100> movement<00:01:36.880> things<00:01:37.600> of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
at the Abraham Hicks movement things of

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.580 
at the Abraham Hicks movement things of
that<00:01:38.200> nature<00:01:38.229> saying<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.940> are<00:01:40.149> all<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:41.140> one

that nature saying we are all just one
the<00:01:42.399> collective<00:01:43.060> experience<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:44.290> you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
the collective experience and when you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.430 
the collective experience and when you
were<00:01:44.500> sharing<00:01:44.830> your<00:01:45.610> experience<00:01:46.270> only<00:01:47.259> in

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
were sharing your experience only in

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.469 
were sharing your experience only in
Italy<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.640> feeling<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.450> blue<00:01:51.030> cord<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.330> was

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
Italy of feeling that blue cord that was

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.539 
Italy of feeling that blue cord that was
connecting<00:01:53.140> everyone<00:01:53.470> okay<00:01:54.220> that's

connecting everyone okay that's

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.430 
connecting everyone okay that's
