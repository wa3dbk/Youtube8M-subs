00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.050
 from 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.110
 what I just did that was 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.000
 pretty similar to the original one starts 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.000
 with onlive-pulled town 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 then has 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 loud 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 When you realize I have them 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.130
 pretty long this pot 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:23.760
 that was pretty long this was that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:25.800
 variation of this for eckhard witte it 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.480
 only three goals but you can also only be 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.790
 you can not find a new day you can do this 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.450
 small elements brutally new 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.310
 compound change can suspect 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.580
 you are the ones that are all that little 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.860
 Lions are as standard as they can be 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.020
 like butter from pozzo in the picture you get 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.150
 always reassembled 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.780
 the long since a small part of the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.700
 main zone and builds on that sets 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.910
 especially if you can do that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.910
 can you ? 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.600
 Thousands of user options are available 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.210
 you only need a few paddling 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.520
 few small riffs and you can do something completely 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.560
 to improvise that again 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.090
 that's the charm of greeting that's that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.090
 koran on blues
