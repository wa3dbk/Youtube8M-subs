 if you like those videos like that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.879

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 and the questions most in demand 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 White has been the most in demand 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 I'll just answer you 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 general questions personal questions 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 or how things look like what a custom 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.500
 that and the video that I carried that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 just answered the general 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.330
 ask or ask the personal 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 For example, what is your job or profession 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.689
 I'll be a bit like that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.850
 to answer the questions in more detail 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 which nail polish will be applied then 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.329
 Of course, I'm just the only one 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.850
 say names and then we start now 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 not long to talk like that around us 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.360
 do not start scratching us now 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 long around that actually you 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.850
 is thus say the first question you have 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.590
 So I have a second name 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 my first name is make that know 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.290
 her yes or with my family and mine 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.470

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.939
 channel is written rebecca c and me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.280
 the name is actually okay but 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.040
 I'm glad that Martin 's first name 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
 is and yes it's the name 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 I use actually just about even 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 not rebecca so has my 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.330
 identity card passport blablabla though 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.810
 So far , of course , now know 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.330
 many that rebecca got him full 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.280
 for a minute knew that not so many 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.430
 what second question is what are you doing 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.070
 professional what is my dream job 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.840
 I have been asking this question for years 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.580
 I have been doing this for three years 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 youtube videos and thats my biggest one 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.350
 Passion and passion there 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.090
 I just had the luck and could 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.350
 That's what I see as a profession 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.180
 think that's the best thing one 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.100
 can happen if one hobby be their 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.720
 make his passion a career 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.060
 it's just amazing when 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.310
 someone is gifted and likes 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.810
 Screwing cars or something like that 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
 but it is still mechanic 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.490
 wonderful if someone likes to paint or 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.980
 something or joy has it with colors 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.080
 to experiment then one should 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.640
 cavern artist or whatever I am 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.160
 just think it's so nice if you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 easy to turn your hobby into a profession 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.450
 and I did that with youtube 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.370
 and yes that's my view too 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.860
 I dream job would also like the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.080
 Maybe someday maybe yes 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.269
 behind the camera or in front of the camera too 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.269
 So I like to experiment 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.739
 and I like to be creative and find 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.230
 so do not make up artist if he does 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.080
 that does not go away a bit but that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 Sun now together as a winner 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.690
 So I am very creative and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.600
 would like to be either mega parties 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.239
 or even a moderator, which I like very much 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.980
 beautiful are two professions that are not 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.870
 that is so common that is very difficult there 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 to take a bit of a walk and everything 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.700
 but i hope that maybe i will 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.110
 At some point you can do it that way 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.299
 a bit of my goals 1 of the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.549
 but both at the moment is my profession 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.470
 youtube and i love it all over because 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.200
 i love my community because i like it 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.580
 i love to edit videos to edit 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.049
 I am creative and here I am 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.370
 live out and that's what I just want 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.349
 beautiful and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.379
 I can put only live each to the heart 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.430
 Everyone can try youtube for me 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.500
 It is now my great passion 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 I can live without me 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.950
 actually youtube not really 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.590
 understand my life is just turning 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.730
 in the morning in the evening and youtube but me 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.260
 think that's nice and do not think so 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.849
 bad and I'm just happy 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.459
 about discovering this for me 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.070
 even though many say youtube on 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.690
 long base there it is if water or 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.630
 otherwise what is not neat is 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.990
 Believe me, honestly, that's what it's all about 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.270
 you want and it does not matter what others do 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.220
 say in the moment and have many 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.410
 at that time even with rest youtube said 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.280
 videos should be that and now they come 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.430
 and say 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.470
 Anna Kuhl and so much achieved yes 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.000
 but that's what I've achieved after myself 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.740
 and I would like to do that again 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.690
 thanks but do that and extra video 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.630
 I do not have great prizes for you 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.220
 organized and I'm with you 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.740
 I know it is not without you 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.080
 possible would be the next question is how 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.270
 even you see the hair so you see 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.270
 I am in the youtube years 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.070
 become lighter what the head goes the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.229
 I 'll be tough now 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.150
 my hair at the hairdresser and that respectively 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.430
 bleached with nine percent 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.860
 I do not like it when you have the hair 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.510
 completely his approach bleached I have to 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.130
 Again I see that my hair is the one 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.320
 grow moment really totally fast 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.099
 I always put on my only highlights because 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.270
 then that does not look too extreme 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.139
 but is still a very small one 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.750
 there is something in contrast and everything is like that 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.120
 platinum blond yes, as I said only one 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.570
 percent then how do you like tattoos and 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.490
 piercings do you have what i have one 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.650
 belly button piercing I have with me 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.570
 Let pierce 14 again 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.729
 however, I would have better by now 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.740
 I think I should wait that way 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.150
 my piercing nice it is a bit 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.610
 become oblique 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.670
 but it does not have the polar rose 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.440
 to say 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.550
 how can they do it, we are everything 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.170
 but I have seen that a bit 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.010
 but I thought I know 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.960
 already what he is doing 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:58.090
 and yes, well, I do not have any 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.920
 but I will soon make me to 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.390
 I will take you and then 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.190
 then comes as I said 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.350
 video and I'm really looking forward to it 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.600
 I 'm really looking forward to it and what it is 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.450
 will and why and let that be you 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.650
 then leave but not now and 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.900
 I'm happy and totally eager 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.130
 because I have been for a very long time 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.400
 wish you yes what camera do you use that 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:28.590
 the canon eos 600d little use one 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.200
 absolute favorite song at the moment is 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.970
 of love i totally at the moment i sing 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.660
 up and I would go up and down 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.340
 nonsensical and the last question in the 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.260
 asked very often last time 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.330
 has been whether I have a boyfriend 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.120
 I will watch my videos for a long time 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.370
 I know that I had a relationship 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.870
 So that's actually the question 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.760
 answered no I have at the moment 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.650
 no friend and that is something 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.680
 no longer i had a relationship 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.240
 I wanted to go for almost five years 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.470
 Do not comment on what exactly 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 Now the reason was why we were 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.620
 have disconnected or otherwise it has 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.900
 just not worked anymore we are 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.670
 came together very early and it was 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.890
 a wonderful time and I would the 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.680
 There was nothing a trade in the moment 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.250
 I'm single and I want that too 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.400
 stay first and that is actually 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.820
 Also the question answered and what were 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.470
 we all so that all otherwise all 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.420
 love questions I answered now 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.110
 I hope I could you out as a 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.310
 not a little insight into my life 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.980
 always live or 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.810
 answer a little bit like that and so on 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.120

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.760

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.560
