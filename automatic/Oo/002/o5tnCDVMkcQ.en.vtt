it should be a lot of fun and it's
important<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> note<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.479> isn't<00:01:27.899> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
important to note this isn't a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
important to note this isn't a
competition<00:01:28.439> between<00:01:28.860> Andrew<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.060> but

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
competition between Andrew and I but

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.550 
competition between Andrew and I but
instead<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.700> vehicle<00:01:32.700> against<00:01:33.329> vehicle<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
instead it's vehicle against vehicle so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520 
instead it's vehicle against vehicle so
as<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.270> we're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.049> have

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
as we go on we're going to have

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
as we go on we're going to have
different<00:01:37.979> skills<00:01:38.250> competition<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
different skills competition that is

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.160 
different skills competition that is
tailored<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.890> each<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.430> our<00:01:41.520> vehicles

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
tailored to each of our vehicles

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
tailored to each of our vehicles
strengths<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.890> example<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.640> imagine

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
strengths so as an example I imagine

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
strengths so as an example I imagine
that<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.990> Mugen<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.500> handle<00:01:47.070> better<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that the Mugen will handle better at the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
that the Mugen will handle better at the
track<00:01:47.670> than<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.899> Forza<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.520> savage<00:01:50.939> X<00:01:51.149> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
track than the Forza or the savage X so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
track than the Forza or the savage X so
with<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.289> let's<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> over<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> rules<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
with that let's go over the rules of the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.389 
with that let's go over the rules of the
short<00:01:54.210> jump<00:01:54.590> ok<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> reason<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:56.039> call<00:01:56.219> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
short jump ok the reason we call this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940 
short jump ok the reason we call this
the<00:01:56.610> short<00:01:56.820> ramp<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.950> there's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the short ramp as you can see there's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
the short ramp as you can see there's
not<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> whole<00:01:59.549> lot<00:01:59.579> of<00:02:00.149> area<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> some<00:02:01.380> good

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
not a whole lot of area to get some good

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.580 
not a whole lot of area to get some good
speeds<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:03.299> soon<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.960> we'll<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.409> in

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
speeds up but soon what we'll do is in

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
speeds up but soon what we'll do is in
the<00:02:04.680> long<00:02:04.920> ramp<00:02:05.280> we'll<00:02:05.909> find<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.750> place<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the long ramp we'll find a place to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650 
the long ramp we'll find a place to
where<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.289> can<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.090> hit<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.330> ramp<00:02:09.479> at

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
where you can go you can hit the ramp at

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.860 
where you can go you can hit the ramp at
full<00:02:10.110> throttle<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.400> desire<00:02:11.870> alright

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
full throttle if you so desire alright

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.710 
full throttle if you so desire alright
so<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.260> are<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.470> rules<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.980> get

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so here are the rules you get

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
so here are the rules you get
to<00:02:16.290> warm<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.680> jumps<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.490> don't<00:02:17.670> count

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
learned is man it's hard to get any kind

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.420 
learned is man it's hard to get any kind
of<00:06:44.300> traction<00:06:44.360> on<00:06:44.750> this<00:06:44.930> grass<00:06:45.430> especially

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
of traction on this grass especially

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.240 
of traction on this grass especially
kind<00:06:46.580> of<00:06:46.700> at<00:06:46.820> an<00:06:46.940> angle<00:06:47.060> and<00:06:47.810> so<00:06:48.170> yeah<00:06:48.470> yeah<00:06:49.220> I

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
kind of at an angle and so yeah yeah I

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.860 
kind of at an angle and so yeah yeah I
mean<00:06:49.400> it<00:06:49.460> was<00:06:49.580> like<00:06:49.670> we<00:06:49.880> could<00:06:50.240> we<00:06:50.600> were<00:06:50.660> going

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
mean it was like we could we were going

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.600 
mean it was like we could we were going
maybe<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.500> was<00:06:51.710> going<00:06:51.890> probably<00:06:52.310> a<00:06:52.340> quarter

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
maybe I was going probably a quarter

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.370 
maybe I was going probably a quarter
throttle<00:06:53.150> and<00:06:53.540> then<00:06:53.660> I'd<00:06:53.750> punch<00:06:54.020> it<00:06:54.140> right<00:06:54.290> as

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
throttle and then I'd punch it right as

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.920 
throttle and then I'd punch it right as
I<00:06:54.470> hit<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.620> ramp<00:06:54.860> so<00:06:55.690> that's<00:06:56.690> still<00:06:56.810> pretty

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
I hit the ramp so that's still pretty

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.580 
I hit the ramp so that's still pretty
cool<00:06:57.170> so<00:06:57.710> up<00:06:58.700> next<00:06:58.760> will<00:06:59.180> be<00:06:59.330> these<00:06:59.630> low<00:07:00.020> c8<00:07:00.320> 10

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
cool so up next will be these low c8 10

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.780 
cool so up next will be these low c8 10
in<00:07:00.860> the<00:07:01.790> hyper<00:07:02.090> 7<00:07:02.540> and<00:07:02.870> then<00:07:03.620> looks<00:07:04.340> like<00:07:04.400> the

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
in the hyper 7 and then looks like the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.840 
in the hyper 7 and then looks like the
luceat<00:07:05.270> 2.0<00:07:05.720> will<00:07:06.190> take<00:07:07.190> on<00:07:07.400> the<00:07:07.550> winner<00:07:07.700> of

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
luceat 2.0 will take on the winner of
