tape you want to long enough so reach
underneath<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:37.129> Dynamo<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:39.769> we're<00:02:39.860> going

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
underneath the Dynamo so now we're going

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.119 
underneath the Dynamo so now we're going
to<00:02:40.010> connect<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> wire<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.599> rear<00:02:41.750> light<00:02:42.129> so

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
to connect the wire to the rear light so

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.160 
to connect the wire to the rear light so
you<00:02:43.190> take<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.519> second<00:02:43.940> bundle<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.659> wire<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
you take your second bundle of wire and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.390 
you take your second bundle of wire and
you<00:02:45.370> route<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.580> from<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:48.379> back<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.129> front

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
you route it from the back for the front

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.990 
you route it from the back for the front
so<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.900> connectors<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:52.489> by<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
so you have your connectors here by the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.680 
so you have your connectors here by the
light<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.569> our<00:02:53.930> drama<00:02:54.230> our<00:02:54.470> wine<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:56.540> try

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
light of our drama our wine and just try

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.940 
light of our drama our wine and just try
to<00:02:56.750> get<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.079> out<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.500> way<00:02:57.650> instead<00:02:57.799> of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
to get it out of the way instead of

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.250 
to get it out of the way instead of
catch<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.340> things<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.299> so<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.079> a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
catch on things and so it's just a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.849 
catch on things and so it's just a
matter<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.970> pushing<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:03.110> up<00:03:03.530> into<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.250 

connector<00:03:09.859> just<00:03:10.099> do<00:03:10.519> two<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.510> them<00:03:12.940> voila<00:03:14.260> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
connector just do two of them voila so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.619 
connector just do two of them voila so
now<00:03:15.379> we're<00:03:15.500> going<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.650> attach<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:17.120> two<00:03:17.329> wires

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
now we're going to attach the two wires

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.039 
now we're going to attach the two wires
from<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:19.010> lights<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.670> bottom<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
from the lights to the bottom of the

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.430 
from the lights to the bottom of the
Dynamo<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:23.329> here<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.629> have<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.840> wire<00:03:24.019> from<00:03:24.379> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
Dynamo so here we have the wire from the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.039 
Dynamo so here we have the wire from the
front<00:03:24.680> light<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:26.000> therefore<00:03:26.359> positive<00:03:26.540> we're

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
front light and therefore positive we're

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.099 
front light and therefore positive we're
going<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.230> stick<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.950> left

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
going to stick it on the left

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.039 
going to stick it on the left
so<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:30.950> poked<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.640> hole<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:32.690> holes<00:03:32.900> I'm

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
so I poked it in the hole the holes I'm

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.680 
so I poked it in the hole the holes I'm
going<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.410> have<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> slight<00:03:34.459> funnel<00:03:34.940> shape<00:03:35.180> just

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
going in have a slight funnel shape just

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.940 
going in have a slight funnel shape just
so<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.959> can<00:03:36.079> differentiate<00:03:36.410> from<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.799> other

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
so you can differentiate from the other

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.309 
so you can differentiate from the other
side<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.400> then

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
side and then

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.740 
side and then
maybe<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.799> going<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.120> hops<00:03:41.120> aside<00:03:41.599> this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
maybe this going to hops aside this

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.259 
maybe this going to hops aside this
thing's<00:03:41.989> divided<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.739> quite<00:03:43.310> clear<00:03:43.579> which

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
thing's divided so quite clear which

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.490 
thing's divided so quite clear which
said<00:03:44.540> goes<00:03:44.720> where<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.220> then<00:03:47.170> same<00:03:48.170> thing<00:03:48.200> on

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
said goes where and then same thing on

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.229 
said goes where and then same thing on
the<00:03:48.620> other<00:03:48.650> side<00:03:48.829> so<00:03:49.670> now<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.879> we<00:03:50.000> have<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
the other side so now that we have the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.979 
the other side so now that we have the
wires<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> clip<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.129> bent<00:03:52.519> over<00:03:52.989> it's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
wires in the clip and bent over it's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.390 
wires in the clip and bent over it's
time<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.200> press<00:03:54.590> them<00:03:54.799> into<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> bottom<00:03:55.310> of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
time to press them into the bottom of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.180 
time to press them into the bottom of
the<00:03:55.459> dynamo<00:03:55.849> make<00:03:56.629> sure<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.900> have<00:03:57.110> your<00:03:57.290> wires

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the dynamo make sure you have your wires

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.970 
the dynamo make sure you have your wires
coming<00:03:58.519> out<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:58.970> end<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.390> it<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:02.980> press

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
coming out the back end of it and press

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.460 
coming out the back end of it and press
and<00:04:04.250> make<00:04:04.489> sure<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.760> get<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.000> pressed<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.480> nice

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
and make sure you get it pressed in nice

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.080 
and make sure you get it pressed in nice
and<00:04:06.680> tight

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.960 

now<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.260> all<00:04:10.410> hooked<00:04:10.620> up<00:04:10.800> let's<00:04:11.670> try<00:04:11.910> it

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
now that it's all hooked up let's try it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.490 
now that it's all hooked up let's try it
out<00:04:12.650> push<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.890> down<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.310> engage<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:15.410> look<00:04:16.410> at

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
out push that down to engage in look at

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.340 
out push that down to engage in look at
that<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.450> now<00:04:18.570> we're<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.780> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.019> test<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
that so now we're just going to test the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.290 
that so now we're just going to test the
back<00:04:19.500> line<00:04:19.739> I'm<00:04:19.950> sure<00:04:20.160> that's<00:04:20.340> working<00:04:23.300> okay

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
back line I'm sure that's working okay

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.950 
back line I'm sure that's working okay
here<00:04:25.169> can't<00:04:25.440> eat<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.590> road<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:26.190> like<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> say

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
here can't eat a road we like to say

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
