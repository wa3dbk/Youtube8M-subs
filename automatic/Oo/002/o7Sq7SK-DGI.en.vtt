00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 Super Mario Maker is first and foremost 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.590
 an editor at his own mario level 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.940
 but he is also a game for you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.859
 of course, the works of others 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 experience the user himself and look at it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 We look first at the overview 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.890
 is actually relatively good on the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.510
 First one is with the internet 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.279
 connected and then get one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.349
 charge different levels you can 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 You can see in their entirety who they see 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.160
 has built where the one comes from 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.450
 can also check how many people 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.399
 the level already successful 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 have completed and if a level 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 like then assigns you a star on 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.469
 you can also do the level 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 Download and then it yourself 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.230
 tinkering and any changes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.230
 perform 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.090
 many of the levels and there you are allowed 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.739
 Now do not be surprised that some level 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.329
 maybe in your sales version 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.850
 will not be there because it acts 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.449
 This is a review code with extra 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.980
 servers 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.839
 many of the levels are very good 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.100
 also designed very creative so there 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.320
 you have thought a lot of thoughts 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.030
 and when you first hand it yourself 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 you will see this editor 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.990
 that's not that easy 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.000
 can at different places in the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 levels comment and tell what a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.390
 What did not please you 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.520
 As I said you can forgive stars 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.409
 and some people were even so creative 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.630
 that they have changed the genre as well 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.250
 here at the level you have such a kind 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.200
 sidescroller like in breath 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.479
 But you can see that too 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.159
 editor sometimes reaches its limits 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.080
 for example when the camera does not quite know 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.300
 whether they mario or not to follow it 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.890
 The little mario will soon be out 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.899
 disappear up the picture and the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 Camera does not pull after that one can in the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 Unfortunately, do not edit editor yourself 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.490
 by the way, as with dark souls you can see 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.170
 even where most people died 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.580
 which is particularly interesting if you 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.869
 himself built a level and times 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.649
 want to see where it is at the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.649
 most appeals 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.850
 sometimes you control not only mario 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.710
 although the game Super Mario maker's 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.510
 but you also have 100 different ones 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.860
 extra figures that partly 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.630
 to feel a little different 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.520
 it's the same with the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 different level skins there you have 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520
 the choice between different mario 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.260
 play that the physics of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.470
 Partially changes the feel of the game 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.480
 a little different is this secret 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.520
 100 characters are unlocked by you 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.200
 these 100 mario challenges 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.630
 masters the gibson easily normal and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.390
 difficult and that's what it means 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.230
 Try 100 randomly 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 create a level 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 between all the great levels in but 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.110
 sometimes which is there 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.790
 the farmer does not really have much trouble 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.800
 given or just wanted a bit 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.209
 around like here for example in 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.570
 This level is really nothing to 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.310
 see 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.590
 and at the moment we tested 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.030
 So there were on the review servers 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.590
 still no possibility to exclude 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.209
 that such levels come 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.470
 but you can also level 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.120
 skip if they maybe too 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.890
 are difficult because in general is the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.810
 Difficulty already relatively high there 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 how many people try a possible one 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 build sadistic level 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.030
 however, it will not be impossible 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.320
 give sections because you have the level 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.120
 Do it yourself before you do it 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.160
 can upload 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 how the editor works that shows 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.220
 I now in a small timelapse 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 function the whole is double 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 played because otherwise it would be a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.800
 Little go beyond the scope of this test 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.180
 and as you can see it works 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.739
 stand out from different 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.510
 obstruct or even place that 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.130
 very easy to make from soils 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.050
 that with the gamepad and with the stylus 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.760
 and then place things as you do 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.459
 First of all, it means something like the level 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.780
 should look like there are many 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.489
 possibilities you do not have to 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.680
 necessarily because now a haunted house 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.660
 level has chosen the ghost of samples 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.130
 take and also the goal one can 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.130
 of course as move as you like 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.670
 the different elements one man 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.410
 It can be used day by day 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.650
 you can do that 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.060
 Accelerate by looking at the clock of the view 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.340
 but first you have to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.700
 have built level before going to the next one 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.680
 Charge gets this will not now 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.480
 a super technically mature 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.060
 complex level but rather now 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.730
 to illustrate how to do such a thing 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.870
 very simple level builds up there's 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.120
 Of course, very many possibilities 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.890
 and that is actually everything 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.630
 relatively intuitive because if you 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.760
 Now things that you can feel like 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.800
 for example, the lucky or even such a 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.990
 question mark box then you just take it 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.140
 the item you want to have and pull 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.670
 it on the lucky to or the box too 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.410
 The coins are simply placed in 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.850
 the one with the paw in this case 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.410
 wipes across the screen and there is 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.700
 also a lot of helpful functions 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.230
 the partially, however, only 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.850
 later be released for 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.280
 example , you can be displayed 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.260
 how far mario can jump and that 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.180
 also quite funny is that there are some 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.950
 objects are the first shake 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.450
 needs to get an alternative 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.100
 So if you have a little book now 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.020
 would like to choose then if from 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.440
 you want to have the circle then you have to 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.440
 shake 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.249
 So a really complex and great 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.139
 managed to build the level as needed 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.060
 you have some time and you have too 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.590
 many are probably trying that one there 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.330
 now graduated to see if so 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.120
 reasonably works like that 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.069
 like the thing is that this is 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.110
 editor of course, a lot of fun 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.090
 even younger players but that the 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.550
 level you can not play then 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.560
 be sure to deliver the quality you want 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.389
 from professional level designer in 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.249
 a normal Mario game expected 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.740
 Of course there are very great creative 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.210
 things people have already built but 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.520
 the level of difficulty is relative 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.830
 high which is also urgently missing 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.330
 An option is the level of friends 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.819
 to be able to play because at the moment can 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.169
 one can only find out by the id 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.419
 friend needs to share that needs to be even better 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.419
 Otherwise, a successful title
