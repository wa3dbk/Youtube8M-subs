pattern side down now I've just drawn

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.429 
pattern side down now I've just drawn
highlighted<00:00:21.029> marks<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> show<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.840> pattern<00:00:22.050> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
highlighted marks to show a pattern just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.310 
highlighted marks to show a pattern just
for<00:00:22.770> to<00:00:23.640> make<00:00:23.790> it<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.029> clear<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.450> you<00:00:24.540> can<00:00:24.689> do

for to make it more clear but you can do
this<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.919> plain<00:00:26.130> sheet<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> paper<00:00:26.610> as

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this with just a plain sheet of paper as

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.269 
this with just a plain sheet of paper as
well<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> begin<00:00:28.680> you're<00:00:28.950> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> lay<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
well so to begin you're going to lay it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.249 
well so to begin you're going to lay it
down<00:00:29.490> flat<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.270> table<00:00:30.419> with<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.809> pattern

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
down flat on the table with the pattern

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.709 
down flat on the table with the pattern
side<00:00:31.500> facing<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.239> now<00:00:33.239> we're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> fold

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
side facing down now we're going to fold

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.620 
side facing down now we're going to fold
it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.930> half<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.620> short<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.600> make<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it in half the short way and make a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:46.610 
it in half the short way and make a
sharp<00:00:36.989> crease<00:00:37.320> along<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> line<00:00:43.550> like<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.620> now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
sharp crease along that line like so now

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.660 
sharp crease along that line like so now
we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> turn<00:00:47.609> it<00:00:47.730> again<00:00:47.999> and<00:00:48.300> fold<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
we're going to turn it again and fold it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.240 
we're going to turn it again and fold it
one<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.940> time

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.490 

and<00:00:57.730> make<00:00:58.150> one<00:00:58.360> more<00:00:58.570> sharp<00:00:58.900> crease<00:00:59.200> along

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
and make one more sharp crease along

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.960 
and make one more sharp crease along
that<00:00:59.740> side<00:01:02.130> they're<00:01:03.130> going<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.370> open<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:03.820> back

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
that side they're going to open it back

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.280 
that side they're going to open it back
up<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.449> you<00:01:05.410> want<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:06.450> long<00:01:07.450> fold<00:01:07.780> at<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:07.960> top

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
up and you want the long fold at the top

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.710 
up and you want the long fold at the top
up<00:01:08.560> here<00:01:08.620> on<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.130> edge<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.729> we're<00:01:10.540> going<00:01:10.660> to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
up here on this edge and we're going to

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.530 
up here on this edge and we're going to
take<00:01:10.810> one<00:01:11.050> side<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.580> fold<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:13.000> down<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
take one side and fold it down to the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.180 
take one side and fold it down to the
middle<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.960> Crete<00:01:14.290> fully<00:01:14.710> along<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
middle of the Crete fully along the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:23.040 
middle of the Crete fully along the
middle<00:01:15.430> crease<00:01:17.190> like<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.220> triangle<00:01:18.610> shape<00:01:22.050> and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
middle crease like a triangle shape and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.340 
middle crease like a triangle shape and
increase<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.770> line<00:01:24.840> learning<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.930> same<00:01:26.140> for

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
increase that line learning the same for

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:38.700 
increase that line learning the same for
the<00:01:26.470> other<00:01:26.619> side

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.859 

so<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.370> now<00:01:39.610> have<00:01:39.640> something<00:01:40.240> looks<00:01:40.540> kind<00:01:40.840> of

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
so you now have something looks kind of

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.830 
so you now have something looks kind of
like<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.049> house<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:43.180> we're<00:01:43.540> going<00:01:43.720> to

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
like a house and now we're going to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:54.720 
like a house and now we're going to
unfold<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:45.040> entire<00:01:45.400> sheet

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.580 

so<00:01:55.330> now<00:01:55.450> we're<00:01:55.600> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.870> take<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.230> and

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
so now we're going to take this and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.230 
so now we're going to take this and
we're<00:01:56.680> going<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.890> fold<00:01:57.160> this<00:01:57.280> back<00:01:57.490> along<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
we're going to fold this back along the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.320 
we're going to fold this back along the
center<00:01:58.870> crease<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.580> can<00:02:00.730> reverse<00:02:01.090> this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
center crease so we can reverse this

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:12.930 
center crease so we can reverse this
crease<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:11.190> unfold<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.490> so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
crease like that and unfold it and so

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.270 
crease like that and unfold it and so
now<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.120> should<00:02:13.360> see<00:02:13.390> these<00:02:13.720> X's<00:02:14.440> or<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.070> One

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
now you should see these X's or the One

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.190 
now you should see these X's or the One
X<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.670> through<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> middle<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:17.080> we're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
X right through the middle so we're

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.590 
X right through the middle so we're
going<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.380> take<00:02:17.560> these<00:02:17.950> two<00:02:18.280> corners<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.060> fold

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
going to take these two corners and fold

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.540 
going to take these two corners and fold
them<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.990> together<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.550> then

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
them up together like that and then

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.610 
them up together like that and then
bring<00:02:24.970> them<00:02:25.150> straight<00:02:25.450> down<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.320> it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
bring them straight down so that it's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.320 
bring them straight down so that it's
kind<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.860> sticking<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:33.880> take<00:02:34.090> these

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
kind of sticking up and then take these

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.250 
kind of sticking up and then take these
two<00:02:35.110> fold<00:02:35.380> these<00:02:35.560> down<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.160> top<00:02:37.080> now<00:02:38.080> we're

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
two fold these down on top now we're

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.510 
two fold these down on top now we're
going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.530> crease<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.280> stays<00:02:42.460> in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
going to crease this so that it stays in

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.500 
going to crease this so that it stays in
one<00:02:42.700> spot

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.990 

snowing<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.470> kind<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.920> house<00:02:51.099> shape<00:02:51.519> looking

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
snowing a kind of a house shape looking

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.809 
snowing a kind of a house shape looking
thing<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:55.170> take<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.439> bottom<00:02:56.769> flap<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.340> it

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
thing then take the bottom flap and it

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.869 
thing then take the bottom flap and it
should<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> flap<00:02:58.480> up<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:59.459> you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.579> see<00:03:00.730> this

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
should be a flap up to you can see this

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.640 
should be a flap up to you can see this
this<00:03:01.120> corner<00:03:01.629> you<00:03:02.019> can<00:03:02.140> see<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.409> part

underneath<00:03:11.970> hold<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.209> straight<00:03:13.540> along

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
underneath hold that straight along

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.490 
underneath hold that straight along
they're<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.329> flip<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.720> over<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.409> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
they're going to flip it over do the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:30.200 
they're going to flip it over do the
same<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> other<00:03:18.010> side

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.240 

like<00:03:30.870> that

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.740 

so<00:03:35.170> now<00:03:36.170> we're<00:03:36.320> going<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.470> unfold<00:03:36.650> these<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
so now we're going to unfold these just

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.650 
so now we're going to unfold these just
put<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.020> back<00:03:39.200> we'll<00:03:39.470> use<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.650> crease<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
put them back we'll use that crease and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.200 
put them back we'll use that crease and
we're<00:03:42.560> going<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.740> take<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.070> top<00:03:43.610> point<00:03:43.910> and

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
we're going to take the top point and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.580 
we're going to take the top point and
fold<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.570> down<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.080> middle<00:03:45.350> crease<00:03:50.590> and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
fold it down to the middle crease and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.130 
fold it down to the middle crease and
you<00:03:51.709> want<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:52.070> around<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.430> center<00:03:52.880> line

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
you want that around that center line

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.460 
you want that around that center line
and<00:03:54.140> increase<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.740> top<00:03:56.980> now<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:58.100> parts

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
and increase the top now this parts

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.870 
and increase the top now this parts
probably<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.800> most<00:04:00.980> tricky<00:04:01.130> but<00:04:01.640> it's<00:04:01.760> not

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
probably the most tricky but it's not

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.340 
probably the most tricky but it's not
that<00:04:02.060> bad<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.990> one<00:04:03.500> hand<00:04:03.940> take<00:04:04.940> pinch<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
that bad so in one hand take pinch the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.940 
that bad so in one hand take pinch the
top<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.640> corner<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:09.290> flat<00:04:09.680> piece

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
top of the corner and this flat piece

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.180 
top of the corner and this flat piece
sheet<00:04:10.580> in<00:04:10.820> one<00:04:11.300> hand<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.470> with<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.739> other<00:04:12.860> one

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
sheet in one hand and with the other one

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.010 
sheet in one hand and with the other one
you<00:04:13.610> can<00:04:13.790> grab<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.180> other<00:04:14.300> side<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.750> pull<00:04:14.989> it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
you can grab the other side and pull it

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.159 
you can grab the other side and pull it
apart<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.560> lay<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:15.950> flat<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.660> now<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.780> have<00:04:17.840> two

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
apart and lay it flat so now I have two

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.440 
apart and lay it flat so now I have two
points<00:04:18.590> sticking<00:04:18.799> up<00:04:19.180> we're<00:04:20.180> just<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.390> to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
points sticking up we're just going to

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.090 
points sticking up we're just going to
fold<00:04:20.690> these<00:04:20.900> corners<00:04:21.380> down<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.010> just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
fold these corners down so if you just

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.380 
fold these corners down so if you just
take<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.520> pull<00:04:23.360> outward<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:25.370> fold<00:04:25.940> these<00:04:26.120> down

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
take it pull outward and fold these down

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.630 
take it pull outward and fold these down
into<00:04:26.660> little<00:04:26.750> triangles<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:27.980> don't<00:04:28.580> do

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
into little triangles like so don't do

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:40.820 
into little triangles like so don't do
that<00:04:28.790> both<00:04:29.000> sides

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.680 

so<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.730> our<00:04:41.850> corners<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:42.390> now<00:04:42.420> we're

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
so now have our corners so now we're

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.250 
so now have our corners so now we're
going<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.920> lay<00:04:43.920> this<00:04:44.160> flat<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:45.080> front<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.170> us

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
going to lay this flat in front of us

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.830 
going to lay this flat in front of us
and<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:47.640> want<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.970> tabbed<00:04:48.240> edges<00:04:48.600> on<00:04:48.720> the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and you want the tabbed edges on the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.290 
and you want the tabbed edges on the
outsides<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.680> we're<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.700> fold<00:04:51.000> those

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
outsides and we're going to fold those

00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:08.780 
outsides and we're going to fold those
off<00:04:51.870> now

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.970 

so<00:05:09.420> i<00:05:09.480> need<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.750> actually<00:05:09.930> take<00:05:10.380> our<00:05:10.560> picture

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
so i need to actually take our picture

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.080 
so i need to actually take our picture
and<00:05:11.720> we<00:05:12.720> lay<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.050> in<00:05:13.170> here<00:05:13.730> right<00:05:14.730> on<00:05:14.850> top<00:05:15.060> of

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
and we lay it in here right on top of

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.540 
and we lay it in here right on top of
the<00:05:15.360> frame<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.830> want<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.100> just<00:05:17.220> try<00:05:17.490> and

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
the frame and you want to just try and

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.810 
the frame and you want to just try and
center<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:18.030> as<00:05:18.210> much<00:05:18.390> as<00:05:18.570> possible<00:05:19.700> so<00:05:20.700> now

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
center this as much as possible so now

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.070 
center this as much as possible so now
we're<00:05:20.910> going<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.090> fold<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.690> corners<00:05:22.140> up<00:05:22.350> along

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
we're going to fold the corners up along

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.260 
we're going to fold the corners up along
onto<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.200> top<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.650> picture<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:27.120> then

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
onto the top of the picture and then

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.640 
onto the top of the picture and then
create<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.600> crease<00:05:27.810> there<00:05:28.080> right<00:05:28.260> along<00:05:28.500> the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
create a crease there right along the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.030 
create a crease there right along the
edge<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.010> picture

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.380 

and<00:05:37.610> do<00:05:37.730> the<00:05:37.820> same<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.300> other<00:05:38.450> side

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.480 

and<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.080> want<00:05:45.230> to<00:05:45.290> make<00:05:45.380> sure<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.980> top

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
and you want to make sure that the top

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.140 
and you want to make sure that the top
or<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.510> folds<00:05:47.870> straight<00:05:48.260> over<00:05:48.670> so<00:05:49.670> that<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
or that folds straight over so that the

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.030 
or that folds straight over so that the
edges<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.540> your<00:05:51.670> folds<00:05:52.670> are<00:05:52.790> lining<00:05:53.060> up<00:05:54.040> right

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
edges of your folds are lining up right

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.770 
edges of your folds are lining up right
along<00:05:55.310> with<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.580> edge<00:05:55.700> of<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.390> top<00:05:56.600> and

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
along with the edge of the top and

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.980 
along with the edge of the top and
bottom<00:05:56.930> of<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.260> frame<00:05:58.300> so<00:05:59.300> now<00:05:59.390> we're<00:05:59.840> almost

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
bottom of the frame so now we're almost

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.190 
bottom of the frame so now we're almost
done<00:06:00.320> take<00:06:00.860> out<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.070> picture<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:02.750> see<00:06:03.080> which

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
done take out the picture and see which

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.890 
done take out the picture and see which
way<00:06:03.440> this<00:06:04.190> needs<00:06:04.490> to<00:06:04.580> be<00:06:04.640> this<00:06:05.390> is<00:06:05.450> going<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.810> be

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
way this needs to be this is going to be

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.570 
way this needs to be this is going to be
the<00:06:06.020> stand<00:06:06.320> so<00:06:06.560> you<00:06:06.620> want<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:06.830> pointing<00:06:07.310> down

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
the stand so you want that pointing down

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.110 
the stand so you want that pointing down
towards<00:06:08.180> you<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:09.650> we'll<00:06:09.800> go<00:06:09.890> like<00:06:10.070> that<00:06:10.280> so<00:06:10.880> set

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
towards you so we'll go like that so set

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.290 
towards you so we'll go like that so set
that<00:06:11.300> like<00:06:11.480> that<00:06:12.550> and<00:06:13.550> take<00:06:13.790> the<00:06:13.910> picture<00:06:14.270> and

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
that like that and take the picture and
