00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
great it was a great series room as we

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
great it was a great series room as we
played<00:00:29.010> amazingly<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:30.060> compared<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
played amazingly I think compared to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.420 
played amazingly I think compared to
other<00:00:31.019> games<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.439> we're<00:00:32.099> feeling<00:00:32.399> really

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
other games so we're feeling really

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.360 
other games so we're feeling really
confident<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.420> into<00:00:33.809> our<00:00:34.710> magic<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.130> ce9

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
confident going into our magic in ce9

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.620 
confident going into our magic in ce9
and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.390> good<00:00:36.570> shot

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and I think we have a really good shot

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
and I think we have a really good shot
of<00:00:36.870> making<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> two<00:00:37.410> worlds<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.579> crushed<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
of making it two worlds you crushed it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.130 
of making it two worlds you crushed it

and everyone was giving you all this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
and everyone was giving you all this
attention<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.010> were<00:00:41.100> doing<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.579> well

looking<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> basically<00:00:45.000> well<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.260> don't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
looking up to you basically well I don't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
looking up to you basically well I don't
know<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.340> didn't<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.700> how<00:00:47.820> people

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
know about it I didn't know how people

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
know about it I didn't know how people
reacted<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.899> games<00:00:49.140> after<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.920> seen<00:00:50.550> until

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
reacted to the games after we seen until

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
reacted to the games after we seen until
after<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.480> played<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
after we played but I don't think I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.990 
after we played but I don't think I
played<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.399> made<00:00:53.550> something<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.820> think

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
played and that I made something I think

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
played and that I made something I think
as<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> team<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.719> played<00:00:54.899> really<00:00:55.020> well<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
as a team we played really well and we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
as a team we played really well and we
took<00:00:55.770> advantage<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:56.489> strengths<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
took advantage of our strengths like a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
took advantage of our strengths like a
split<00:00:57.539> push<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.620> did<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.010> job<00:00:59.070> like

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
split push so they did a good job like

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.470 
split push so they did a good job like
pressuring<00:00:59.820> them<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.359> keep

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pressuring them so I could keep

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
pressuring them so I could keep
splitting<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> stuff<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.640> think

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
splitting and stuff like that so I think

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
splitting and stuff like that so I think
you<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.120> used<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.420> team<00:01:03.570> effort<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you was used as team effort in all the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
you was used as team effort in all the
games<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:05.970> team<00:01:06.150> did<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> great<00:01:06.810> job

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
games the whole team did do a great job

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
games the whole team did do a great job
cop<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.650> were<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.920> aggressive<00:01:08.369> than<00:01:08.490> usual

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cop you were more aggressive than usual

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
cop you were more aggressive than usual
why<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.470> mostly<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.830> guess

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
why is that it was mostly I guess

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.859 
why is that it was mostly I guess
calculated<00:01:12.000> aggression<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> wasn't<00:01:12.780> just

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
calculated aggression it wasn't just

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
calculated aggression it wasn't just
like<00:01:13.049> blind<00:01:13.320> um<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.920> usually<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.600> aggressive

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
like blind um I usually go aggressive

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
like blind um I usually go aggressive
more<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> good

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
more so when I know that I'm in a good

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
more so when I know that I'm in a good
position<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.450> won't<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.320> high<00:01:19.650> chance<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
position I won't have a high chance of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850 
position I won't have a high chance of
dying<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.330> example<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.409> three

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
dying so like for example the game three

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.859 
dying so like for example the game three
when<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.909> Lulu<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.720> was

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
when I got first put on Lulu there was

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
when I got first put on Lulu there was
like<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> 0%<00:01:25.439> chance<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.979> dying<00:01:26.189> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like a 0% chance to be dying just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
like a 0% chance to be dying just
because<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.150> had<00:01:27.720> shopped<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.350> were<00:01:28.409> both

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
because I had shopped and they were both

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
because I had shopped and they were both
still<00:01:29.220> chunked<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.700> Dragon<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
still chunked from Dragon and so I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
still chunked from Dragon and so I
pretty<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:31.860> thought<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> free<00:01:32.490> kill<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pretty much thought of the free kill I'm

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.069 
pretty much thought of the free kill I'm
like<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> team<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
like a team can I do this and I like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
like a team can I do this and I like
yeah<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.040> nice<00:01:35.250> alright<00:01:35.610> and

vans<00:01:54.540> earlier<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:56.070> had<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> winning

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
vans earlier and we had like a winning

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
vans earlier and we had like a winning
streak<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.210> dang<00:01:57.509> these<00:01:57.659> are<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049

lucky and so I guess today we had a 30
so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.079> guess<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.740> shrimp<00:02:02.070> socks<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.770> I

that um I think the biggest thing about
the<00:02:13.140> first<00:02:13.319> game

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
intent to split push a lot and then the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.330 
intent to split push a lot and then the
fact<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.020> they<00:02:19.170> had<00:02:19.320> too<00:02:19.470> much<00:02:19.560> reduced<00:02:20.250> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
fact that they had too much reduced a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.100 
fact that they had too much reduced a
lot<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> my<00:02:20.640> potential<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> split<00:02:21.420> he<00:02:21.780> did<00:02:21.930> pick

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.320 
thing on me and trying to kill me so
that<00:02:34.110> was<00:02:34.200> something<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.560> had<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.710> overcome<00:02:35.330> by

controlling other stuff and I think it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.890 
controlling other stuff and I think it's
very<00:02:38.490> good<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.030> good<00:02:39.060> job<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.750> then

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
think we were like very confident we

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.830 
think we were like very confident we
were<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:02.460> knew<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:03.090> can<00:04:03.240> we<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.660> get

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
it and then we just played like your

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640 
it and then we just played like your
best<00:04:05.820> was<00:04:06.270> like<00:04:06.480> pretty<00:04:06.630> good<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.560> never

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
best was like pretty good like we never

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.430 
best was like pretty good like we never
played<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.010> way<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.250> I'm<00:04:08.790> really<00:04:09.150> excited

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
played this way so I'm really excited

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.780 
played this way so I'm really excited
did<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:10.530> feel<00:04:10.710> pressure<00:04:10.980> at<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.490> had<00:04:11.670> to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
did you feel pressure at all you had to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
did you feel pressure at all you had to
take<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.120> third<00:04:12.360> game<00:04:12.660> unless<00:04:12.870> they<00:04:13.470> would

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
take that third game unless they would

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.990 
take that third game unless they would
they<00:04:13.980> would<00:04:14.010> start<00:04:14.310> taking<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.700> lead<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
they would start taking the lead and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.370 
they would start taking the lead and
think<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.240> they<00:04:15.390> would<00:04:15.510> get<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> chance<00:04:15.960> did

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
think that they would get a chance did

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.500 
think that they would get a chance did
you<00:04:16.530> feel<00:04:16.710> pressure<00:04:16.859> cop<00:04:17.190> um<00:04:17.549> definitely<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
you feel pressure cop um definitely a

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.090 
you feel pressure cop um definitely a
lot<00:04:18.870> less<00:04:19.140> pressure<00:04:19.290> than<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> first<00:04:19.920> two

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
lot less pressure than the first two

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.070 
lot less pressure than the first two
games<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.640> because<00:04:20.670> with<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.420> two-win<00:04:21.840> lead

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
games just because with a two-win lead

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.590 
games just because with a two-win lead
you<00:04:22.290> know<00:04:22.410> there<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.040> guess<00:04:24.030> their<00:04:24.210> morale<00:04:24.450> is

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
you know there I guess their morale is

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.540 
you know there I guess their morale is
like<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.810> an<00:04:24.900> all-time<00:04:25.169> low<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.620> we<00:04:26.310> know<00:04:26.430> that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
like in an all-time low and we know that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.450 
like in an all-time low and we know that
we<00:04:26.610> have<00:04:26.640> like<00:04:26.820> three<00:04:27.030> chances

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
we have like three chances

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.999 
we have like three chances
so<00:04:28.020> everything<00:04:29.020> was<00:04:29.110> working<00:04:29.289> out<00:04:29.500> for<00:04:29.680> us<00:04:29.710> and

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
so everything was working out for us and

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.370 
so everything was working out for us and
we<00:04:30.100> knew<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:31.360> we<00:04:31.419> just<00:04:31.720> played<00:04:31.930> smart<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
we knew that if we just played smart and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.629 
we knew that if we just played smart and
just<00:04:32.530> kept<00:04:32.800> playing<00:04:32.979> how<00:04:33.130> we're<00:04:33.280> playing<00:04:33.340> we'd

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
just kept playing how we're playing we'd

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.790 
just kept playing how we're playing we'd
win<00:04:33.789> so<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.720> were<00:04:34.870> trying<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.199> ban<00:04:35.350> doublelift

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
win so you were trying to ban doublelift

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.129 
win so you were trying to ban doublelift
out<00:04:36.009> can<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.000> tell<00:04:37.150> me<00:04:37.270> what<00:04:37.479> thought<00:04:37.750> process

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
went into that okay so we thought we

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.499 
went into that okay so we thought we
think<00:04:41.800> we<00:04:41.919> have<00:04:41.949> no<00:04:42.220> idea<00:04:42.460> what<00:04:42.699> CLG<00:04:43.389> was

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
think we have no idea what CLG was

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.779 
think we have no idea what CLG was
playing<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:44.410> we<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.800> sure<00:04:44.830> knew<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.370> double

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
playing but we for sure knew that double

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.120 
playing but we for sure knew that double
a--the<00:04:45.940> realized<00:04:46.630> vain<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.139> know<00:04:47.259> so<00:04:47.680> we

a--the realized vain you know so we

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.640 
a--the realized vain you know so we
decided<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.610> ban<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.910> out<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.330> then<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
decided to ban that out and then the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.439 
decided to ban that out and then the
Twitter's<00:04:51.099> came<00:04:51.310> after<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.849> the<00:04:52.000> second<00:04:52.330> game

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
Twitter's came after in the second game

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.300 
Twitter's came after in the second game
we<00:04:52.810> knew<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.440> was<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.620> problem<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.190> we

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
we knew that it was a problem and we

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.300 
we knew that it was a problem and we
know<00:04:54.460> really<00:04:55.050> used<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.139> deal<00:04:56.259> with<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:56.530> we

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310
