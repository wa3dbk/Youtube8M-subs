00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.760
 many times to juan felipe arias 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.630
 good and to the presidency aranda has said subject it was decided to receive one in each 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.890
 city ​​very warmly to December the mayor her other personalities 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.650
 important and that's nice in signal for the fifa that there are very many 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.319
 importance that there is that Colombia and that the eight cities so 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.710
 to that area 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.289
 and that's why, in general, our feelings are very optimistic. 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.090
 and we are also making songs that already only little things 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 tula of a little lnd worry and for that reason now deep to my colleague to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.580
 iñaki álvarez who has been him 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.300
 the head of our delegation 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 each boast of this inspection a little more 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.410
 in that sense two training combos we have 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 identified 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.250
 33 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 so in four in each venue also those of the colorful short time 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.380
 in which we have seen that there is an artist inheritance in addition to the fields 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.680
 by several people 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.110
 Most of them know that they had a very strong winter and many 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 rains for example 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 in some they are 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 what we have done 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.690
 that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 classify the fields in another clash between three categories 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.720
 in one 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 it's okay we can play tomorrow will attend and need 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.470
 the second so the medium work we have to do something 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.620
 in high three months before the tournament 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.550
 and in category 3 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.350
 that we have to be something tomorrow we go for more before 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.480
 the first of March we have saved 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.470
 about it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.900
 we're 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.030
 the list is not finalized 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 ragpicker 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.100
 the fields are building 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 and now we have to look at each one 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.990
 what we have done week two weeks that come to study it well 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.500
 category that we can categories in each one to be able to develop a plan 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.689
 this intervention 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 e mansur pascal tournament 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.959
 training camps 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.009
 weight of stadiums 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.209
 What we have seen in the stadiums are 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.589
 a range can be said 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.479
 Peru has been in its forties 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.249
 up to 80 percent what 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.789
 some are more advanced than others and that is normal 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.509
 Mrs 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.359
 there is no life 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.070
 there is no problem for the others there is no panic 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.039
 because it's normal now 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.920
 It is not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.479
 to say 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:55.399
 that you can rest is not so difficult that we still have a lot to do 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.539
 some of these stadiums 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.249
 much work is still far away 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.509
 and they have 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.450
 na 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.470
 they have delivery dates to which some are March others in April 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.529
 For us it is very important 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.109
 the date of 27 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.139
 of April 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.969
 when we have a draw and when two team delegates come 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.199
 Bogota 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.879
 adiyiah 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.719
 - we go crazy 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.679
 for example thin 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.349
 the field in the conflict 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.349
 for example for the habits of very good conditions 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 and yesterday we went through the days prd 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.319
 and also 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.969
 Spain in good condition 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.969
 so Bogota is less worry not 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 now 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.959
 they have their debates as the cali 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.249
 for example sports cali 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.919
 nothing that has a field or exceptional 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.469
 neither the problem was filled 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.369
 and Jenna 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.039
 manizales I think 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.819
 varied fields that are called nothing 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.979
 forest 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.879
 night concerts 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.410
 yay there fatah 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.479
 lack of punch 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.729
 stage that the company has to pass as high 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.539
 or else they will not arrive 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.469
 We have received the commitments of the mayor's office 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:19.639
 what are you going to do 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.029
 so 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.950
 we have in that in that system of categories 1 2 3 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.699
 we will include a reporting system 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 where every two weeks they will send us 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.800
 even with photos 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.710
 of how they advance in their developments 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.509
 to prepare the fields 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.559
 and with that plus other visits I do not know if we're going to do it 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.249
 what am I calm but 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.469
 between the two celebrities have 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.469
 roast a way 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.860
