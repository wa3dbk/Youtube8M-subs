canyoneering though let you bring up the
toilet<00:00:43.309> subject<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.270> canyons<00:00:44.870> in

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
toilet subject is that canyons in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.020 
toilet subject is that canyons in
general<00:00:45.530> in<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.710> desert<00:00:45.920> or<00:00:46.219> like<00:00:46.249> the<00:00:46.489> plumbing

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
general in a desert or like the plumbing

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.880 
general in a desert or like the plumbing
system<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.629> desert<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.440> where<00:00:48.649> all<00:00:48.679> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
system of the desert it's where all the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.309 
system of the desert it's where all the
water<00:00:49.249> flows<00:00:49.670> when<00:00:49.999> it<00:00:50.120> rains<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.199> there's

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
water flows when it rains so there's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:52.720 
water flows when it rains so there's
only<00:00:51.409> running<00:00:51.769> water<00:00:52.039> today<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:52.609> we're

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
only running water today but we're
