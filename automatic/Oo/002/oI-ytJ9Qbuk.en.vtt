00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
features that you do have with your

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
features that you do have with your
remote<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.050> sell<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.350> now<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
remote as you can sell right now it is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.130 
remote as you can sell right now it is
an<00:00:19.920> unlock<00:00:20.369> I'll<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.480> go<00:00:21.630> ahead<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.869> arm<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
an unlock I'll just go ahead and arm the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.439 
an unlock I'll just go ahead and arm the
vehicle<00:00:23.630> arms<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.710> guess<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
vehicle arms like so I guess one of the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.759 
vehicle arms like so I guess one of the
main<00:00:27.539> differences<00:00:27.960> between<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.410> factory

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
main differences between the factory

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.720 
main differences between the factory
alarm<00:00:29.480> system<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> hit<00:00:31.380> unlock<00:00:34.730> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
alarm system is if you hit unlock you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290 
alarm system is if you hit unlock you
just<00:00:35.910> walk<00:00:36.059> over<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.570> vehicle<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:38.300> both

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
just walk over to your vehicle and both

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.010 
just walk over to your vehicle and both
sides<00:00:39.510> work<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.550> just<00:00:41.550> mints

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
sides work not just one just mints

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.580 
sides work not just one just mints

by many the you know typical LED light

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.310 
by many the you know typical LED light
that<00:03:23.040> flashes<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> glass<00:03:25.080> break

that flashes I do have a glass break

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.070 
that flashes I do have a glass break
sensor<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.799> here<00:03:26.070> as<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.480> tilt<00:03:27.780> sensor

glass<00:03:36.209> break<00:03:36.420> sensor<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:36.840> here<00:03:36.900> most

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
glass break sensor right here most

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280 
glass break sensor right here most
people<00:03:37.470> would<00:03:38.190> I've<00:03:39.120> seen<00:03:39.510> many<00:03:39.870> videos<00:03:39.959> when

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.370 
someone breaks the glass or whatever
it's<00:03:50.010> gonna<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.310> off

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
it's gonna go off

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.270 
it's gonna go off
anyways<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:54.110> glass<00:03:54.650> break<00:03:54.860> sensor<00:03:55.160> is

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
anyways the glass break sensor is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.700 
anyways the glass break sensor is
actually<00:03:55.790> right<00:03:56.240> there<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.650> see

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
actually right there so as you can see

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.110 
actually right there so as you can see
right<00:03:58.040> there<00:03:58.070> that's<00:03:58.370> your<00:03:58.490> audio<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:58.910> little

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
right there that's your audio a little

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.970 
right there that's your audio a little
sensor<00:03:59.420> right<00:03:59.570> there<00:04:00.430> any<00:04:01.430> loud<00:04:02.060> noise<00:04:02.360> can

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
sensor right there any loud noise can

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.550 
sensor right there any loud noise can
set<00:04:03.980> off<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.250> alarm
