00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello ladies eh no i'm there again 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.080
 welcome to a new episode in metz 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 2 and this in this part we go three yes 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 just fight and you go in the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 comments determine which roller coaster the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.639
 to the you not really next round 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 but just wins out of these three and is that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 now that we are going to do the coach is also a coach 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.130
 also coach too 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600
 and see the sit down in the descent 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.039
 that there was still a bit lagg so I think 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 that we really have to do with one 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.779
 very fun themed roller coaster 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 and it is also a hanging cup in which I am 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 sit it is really a cup of coffee 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.260
 you nice so i don't expect one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 and their calling is in it or something or one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.780
 practice hey special but let's go 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.219
 see what he made of it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 oh it looks very compact 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.980
 I certainly already 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 we certainly have this once in one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.520
 no limits done excuse people like you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.570
 this night but still know you have one 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 good memory 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.309
 this one in my videos anyway 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 been as sorry as those two 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.149
 come on time but yes make that up 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.590
 will get away from this i thought it was one 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 of the nicest roller coasters I had 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.219
 done from those 3 so it might be 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.870
 exciting for the other two to go 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.850
 exceed this wind perhaps 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.799
 once but certainly nice if you like this one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 cannot remember or cannot be seen 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.360
 totally good will also be nice of course 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 well i thought it was nice i found the job 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 color the whole blue sheets separately 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.760
 print with your light blue what they 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.800
 dark blue and 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.870
 it's just a very nice type 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.180
 attraction too and very compact it too 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.710
 all look at each other mi 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.650
 it really done together if you have one 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.210
 attraction is not too bad 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.040
 how close you are to each other 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 don't actually comment before you 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.740
 others see jobs parts yes now 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.070
 go over the water for a short while 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.720
 the water of that gift is fighting I think 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.420
 water can splash or come without coming 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.630
 if so this is a great wonder to me 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.120
 I think find a beautifully done super 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.610
 nicely designed and all the noise 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.680
 truth each other the i here so 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 the trees are going to be like that but back and forth 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.470
 I love the following 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.320
 anonymous go do the air is such q13 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 9087 1653 285 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.740
 I can personally change my name 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.030
 given this just off but I am 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.800
 very curious because it looks very 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.120
 separate when I see it and start 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.920
 looks very special 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.690
 design looks like a beautiful 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.540
 a little bald yet but hereinafter one 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.610
 tree both thought about and what a 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.230
 separate roller coaster also very nice 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.200
 carts 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.930
 and he they I do not see and much of the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.900
 job so that's another surprise 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.400
 and yes i just raving is anyways 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.590
 very nicely done that forgets a lot 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.030
 people sometimes and yes I think anyway 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.320
 word or where your roller coaster a bit 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.820
 a bit the view because you 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.130
 of course you will of course be allowed to and 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.380
 we are also going up very slowly 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.030
 you know you really are a man one 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.850
 cane was quick to kick in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 walk then that I correct it here 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.590
 but that makes it exciting how 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.810
 the longer it takes your more exciting 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.910
 And yes we are we must go up there 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.530
 bite your fingers 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.910
 how high are we actually about it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 reasonable height it can quite be one 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.910
 fast off 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.950
 I'd recommend the roller coaster type anyway 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.640
 it anyway though we do it is to fast 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.810
 to go 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.670
 I am very curious because we see you now 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.489
 t layout and there is the entire layout 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.310
 boys and girls of course 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.640
 oh we are going slowly this is very special 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.640
 that it so 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.640
 Oh 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.760
 flash also a ladder I ran 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.690
 no other stairs there and the steam 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.890
 all right 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.780
 very bad under him it is a green 8 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.950
 water is very often for him 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.450
 Yes 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.060
 they choose a lot for green roller coaster 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.360
 you also know roller coaster types with them 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.360
 very strange 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.570
 certainly not an ugly color that is 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.570
 it just absolutely 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.140
 yes this is definitely a cool roller coasters 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.120
 look guys pro this is cool that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.350
 roll to him and we notice 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.180
 not very much of that helps to it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.130
 end a little bit we are going to keep out the mountain 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.550
 the same for the second time 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.130
 mountain 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.150
 well we just got through some bumps 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.990
 the water parents gave 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.750
 yes yes nice sharp bow you would i 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.120
 could of this is a tricky choice 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.799
 I mean the first one still hanging out 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.170
 this one didn't go either on me either 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.730
 respectable went diode head 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.410
 cool I am very curious about the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.820
 last eight hot this will shall certainly 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.890
 close and take a look at the carts 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.170
 these were the carts very special you sit 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.580
 say two the middle and the other 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.260
 is a bit the outside about one 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.770
 platform that makes it very 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.660
 separately yes this house is inside what 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.610
 inside there is even nonverbal parts 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.120
 see how fat and under the mole we can 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.110
 under the mag even look so beautiful 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.270
 glad we have to go to the last one 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.890
 roller coasters in this episode already the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270
 last roller coaster it goes fast 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.770
 and who have chosen that is the crash 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.360
 that seemed like my has an exciting one 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.790
 roller coaster and now gives it an error message 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.970
 goes right right viewing it click them 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.160
 off in the hope that it will start too 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.640
 a the last roller coaster is a black off 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.530
 where a completely black made and me 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.360

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.780
 I hear this with music and stuff 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.360
 programmed in it 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.180
 ohh it's a little chinese theme 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.300
