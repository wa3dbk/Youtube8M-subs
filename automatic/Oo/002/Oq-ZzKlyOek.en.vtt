00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
to the screen it didn't break at all so

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.340 
to the screen it didn't break at all so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
that's good

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's good
it<00:01:02.500> does<00:01:02.649> have<00:01:02.800> some<00:01:02.829> scuff<00:01:03.219> marks<00:01:03.610> just<00:01:03.670> like

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
it does have some scuff marks just like

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.749 
it does have some scuff marks just like
most<00:01:04.420> devices<00:01:04.960> do<00:01:05.199> on<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.979> backside<00:01:06.369> drop<00:01:06.610> but

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
most devices do on the backside drop but

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.670 
most devices do on the backside drop but
it's<00:01:06.909> still<00:01:07.030> pretty<00:01:07.270> minimal<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:07.990> mean<00:01:08.590> it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
it's still pretty minimal I mean it's

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.609 
it's still pretty minimal I mean it's
just<00:01:08.710> little<00:01:09.070> dings<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.479> there<00:01:10.659> the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
just little dings here and there the

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.030 
just little dings here and there the
screen<00:01:12.430> still<00:01:12.759> fully<00:01:13.030> functional<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.920> that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
screen still fully functional so so that

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.260 
screen still fully functional so so that
is<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.190> survival<00:01:15.729> let's<00:01:15.880> go<00:01:15.970> ahead<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.180> get

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
is a survival let's go ahead and get

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.130 
is a survival let's go ahead and get
onto<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.479> forefoot<00:01:16.930> drop<00:01:17.200> onto<00:01:17.440> its<00:01:17.680> form

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
onto the forefoot drop onto its form

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.530 
onto the forefoot drop onto its form
to

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
to

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.000 
to
I<00:01:29.020> guess<00:01:30.020> let's<00:01:30.200> check<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.530> out<00:01:30.680> see<00:01:30.860> how<00:01:30.980> it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
I guess let's check that out see how it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.060 
I guess let's check that out see how it
did<00:01:33.370> alright<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.990> looks<00:01:36.020> like<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.500> was<00:01:36.650> just

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
did alright so it looks like it was just

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.820 
did alright so it looks like it was just
a<00:01:37.250> little<00:01:37.430> ding<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:37.940> side<00:01:38.240> there<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.830> was

from the top to the bottom the screen
still<00:02:27.459> turns<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.910> still<00:02:28.360> functional<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.709> yeah

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
still turns on still functional but yeah

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.100 
still turns on still functional but yeah
just<00:02:30.250> feeling<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.849> he<00:02:31.090> definitely<00:02:31.930> cut

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
just feeling that he definitely cut

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.350 
just feeling that he definitely cut
yourself<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.650> pretty<00:02:32.830> bad<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:34.209> is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
yourself on this pretty bad so that is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.990 
yourself on this pretty bad so that is
not<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> survival<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:35.709> all<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.790> definitely

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
not a survival at all so I definitely

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.880 
not a survival at all so I definitely
say<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.330> it's<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.690> decently<00:02:38.230> durable<00:02:38.709> device

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
