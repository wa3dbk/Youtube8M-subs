00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.449
 uai 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.780
 Speak there heavy, all good, be well. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 come to another video and today 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.000
 bringing here another mp and gameplay 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.520
 chrome bead which is a white 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 black market is indeed an object well 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.119
 interesting at least I think they are 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 an object used in an American sport 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 What is the good kiss that is not at all 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 common in Brazil is due to the fact that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 brazil be the soccer country denied until 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 gringo sambou along with neymar and gol né 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 well now you can not play anymore 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.680
 with lemon with patrick playing by fred 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 karno hoffmann depends on fred in the cup 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 World hot fucking not win it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.660
 huh 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 but going back to the subject I say that the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 tobacco is an interesting object in the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 fact of the people actually use the taco 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.260
 baseball glove as a white glove for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.610
 defend 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.559
 surely you should have seen one 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.629
 video that the character was there and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.360
 He took a cue to use with the mode 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.249
 defense in the game I did not find the chrome 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.090
 a good one on the white because he is 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:11.939
 very slow nor one the reformed bush but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 the way of using it is practically 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.909
 identical to that of katana 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 I say this because even singing you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.369
 can use the external to hold it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.929
 to let go when you want 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.459
 but when you keep holding it 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.649
 you become very slow so it's okay 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:28.619
 complicated to hit your opponent 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.380
 I did not really like the taco at least 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.539
 For me it's not the whitest ideal but 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.310
 It's up to you and I think it's for you. 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.959
 want to win and you at least have to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.929
 to be very good of katana because like me 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.249
 said both are good looking but beauty 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.169
 let's not talk about a subject I wanted 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.869
 to approach in this video that is about the slash 

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.579
 No, I 'm not talking about slash. 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.950
 guitarist made one of the goals 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.929
 I'm talking about the slash mode of using the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 set in the game because I want to talk about 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.009
 It's simply because I see a lot of 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 people who complain because other formats 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.609
 lech, I'll be honest with you, I will not 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.619
 I'm going to lie 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.659
 I'm a guy who uses a lot of this should 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.939
 So when I get to the hill and I'll stay 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.399
 a little nervous I get a little short though 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.200
 I'm nervous, just like me, I 'm not going 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.870
 There, in the chat, I'm cursing anyone's face. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.010
 Complaining about him I just tell myself 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.650
 It was not a problem. 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.560
 nothing wrong you just from the east is every 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.329
 1,000 mj that exists right even has 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 they are white and I much prefer it 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.909
 in the ten teams causing a good 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.890
 example is the human ax I can play 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.110
 very well using slash if I stay 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.920
 killing 30 in a zone has not killed 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.329
 nobody 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.360
 so I always end up using slash 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.280
 When august ax emanates, let's stop. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500
 Come on, man. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 will also hand you if you are not good at 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.159
 slash then goes in the caracas steppe every 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.530
 one will be good in a way and do not have 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.150
 because crying is the noise of the game is every 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.920
 one of each complaint I'm like 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.379
 see you soon, you will 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.659
 complain at the guy because he shoots 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.840
 seriously same field that will be so the 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.720
 Face shot hurt me the anger of it 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.579
 mano so we will not stop it there 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.769
 he is going to complain to complain only with 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 Severino complains in the game because the guy 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.400
 not're nothing wrong and we play in 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.159
 moral zinha limp because it does not give 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.019
 worse than face that the 10 I 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.639
 I want rain because this is not 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.790
 if you can not kill the guy's face and 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.349
 Suggestion to play to see the face kills 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.930
 shows one more time he goes there and killed the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.449
 Face then this old Sunday the way 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.060
 that they want in the other interesting already 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:33.720
 also I think I was even 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.910
 all the time trying to prove it here not 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.199
 This is what I wanted to talk about in the gameplay of 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.699
 today about this, right? 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.440
 You must be noticing that every 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.299
 day trying to bring my opinion on 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.230
 something people like to complain about 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.060
 huh 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.359
 in the last video was over was not only in the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.669
 what was the last video to was about 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.230
 guns only then I talked about it today 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.090
 I'm talking about slash 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.790
 I'll probably bring a video talking 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.379
 about this on the internet either will not 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.269
 be in the next video because you already have a 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.489
 practically almost recorded with the 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.459
 record the ball but the ball was missing 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.690
 I still do not know what was aggravated, but it's 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.519
 That's when you're enjoying it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.139
 of my opinion if you did not have it 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.629
 They are enjoying a lot of respect because 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.269
 Everyone has their opinion and I thank them 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.590
 here is how you borrowed the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.539
 so I could record with the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 taco is probably the most 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.110
 gameplay with his account because he has 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 some weapons that I intend to record 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.820
 so it was worth the eagle we killed one 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.350
 I want to send a salve to the crew. 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.940
 who attended this line says that 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.190
 record and attended 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.710
 some people who is the manifest 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.919
 dawn wb that incidentally is my sister she 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.400
 it's just a little worse but in her youth 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.680
 to golf black to the road to Senhor Felipe and 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.650
 the rojão cap that the galley of that euphoria 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 nuclear power will go there despite us 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.440
 we are together right? 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.539
 and that's it folks i hope they have 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.090
 liked the gameplay if they liked 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.639
 do not forget to leave that like 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.039
 below to strengthen the channel if you 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.780
 is a new channel, welcome and 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.090
 sign up to follow all the videos 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.960
 nor are we coming to almost a case of 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.729
 enrolled 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.320
 I improved on facebook if you want to change 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.199
 an idea there the link is there in the description 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.780
 human, and that was heavy thanks to the support 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.729
 Neither of you 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.900
 Let's see if I can go to the next video. 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.039
 have come to a position if you had 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.620
 arrived at a car thinking of a 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.440
 special and I had special in 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.740
 almost ready to do but I tried 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.080
 do this with him as sister decided 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.169
 I do not want to take advantage here. 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.570
 talk what you say do not ask what 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.130
 You want to see in the special is because I 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.500
 I want to make a special 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.729
 nelton in doubt even i do but i 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.860
 I intend to do so 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.990
 so leave what you want me to do 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.150
 Make it special there, huh? 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.400
 nor will we win a taste of the idea and 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.990
 ended up doing is leave in comments 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.210
 It's that heavy, thanks to your goal. 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.800
 and repeating the dream we tamos together 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.800
 Thanks.
