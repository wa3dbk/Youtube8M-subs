went round the canvas about three
o'clock<00:02:48.800> now<00:02:49.400> still<00:02:49.430> coming<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.120> at<00:02:50.210> seven

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
o'clock now still coming in at seven

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.250 
o'clock now still coming in at seven
o'clock<00:02:52.630> oh<00:02:54.790> well<00:02:55.790> yes<00:02:56.000> two<00:02:56.270> per<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:56.990> you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
o'clock oh well yes two per you if you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.170 
o'clock oh well yes two per you if you
tell<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.920> about<00:02:58.070> two<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.640> first<00:02:58.850> again

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
tell you about two for the first again

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.780 
tell you about two for the first again
be<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> couple<00:02:59.570> hundred<00:03:00.160> moving<00:03:01.160> rates<00:03:01.400> very

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
be a couple hundred moving rates very

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.140 
be a couple hundred moving rates very
low<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> there's<00:03:03.920> always<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.580> argument

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
low so there's always this argument

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.210 
low so there's always this argument
though<00:03:05.420> very<00:03:05.930> high<00:03:06.110> wounding<00:03:06.560> rates<00:03:06.770> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
though very high wounding rates the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.920 
though very high wounding rates the
argument<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.640> think<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.240> where<00:03:08.630> are<00:03:08.810> all

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
argument I think that is where are all

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.780 
argument I think that is where are all
the<00:03:09.110> wounded<00:03:09.440> duck<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.220> only<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.610> see

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the wounded duck so you only have to see

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.080 
the wounded duck so you only have to see
dead<00:03:11.420> ducks<00:03:11.720> when<00:03:11.989> their<00:03:12.200> parade<00:03:13.090> and
