if you want to buy this model or not um

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.019 
if you want to buy this model or not um
here's<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> view<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> front<00:00:23.400> canopy

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.690 

going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> spin<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.449> around<00:00:31.250> nice<00:00:32.250> looking<00:00:32.579> how

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
going to spin it around nice looking how

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to spin it around nice looking how
the<00:00:32.759> copter<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> colors<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.890> great<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the copter the colors are great on the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
the copter the colors are great on the
front<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> canopy<00:00:36.329> lights<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.719> bright

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
front and the canopy lights up bright

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
front and the canopy lights up bright
blue<00:00:37.200> when<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> looks<00:00:38.070> nice<00:00:38.450> here<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
blue when it's on looks nice here you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
blue when it's on looks nice here you
can<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> tail<00:00:40.140> motor<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
can see the tail motor which is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
can see the tail motor which is
brushless<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> connector<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.230> there

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
brushless it has a connector right there

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500 
brushless it has a connector right there
that's<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.300> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that's a really good thing you can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.119 
that's a really good thing you can
connect<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.020> new<00:00:46.469> tail<00:00:46.710> motor<00:00:46.950> without

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
connect a new tail motor without

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
connect a new tail motor without
replacing<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.789> whole<00:00:48.000> boom<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> everything

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
replacing that whole boom and everything

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.869 
replacing that whole boom and everything
like<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> Nano<00:00:49.680> CPX<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> other

like the Nano CPX and some of the other

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.799 
like the Nano CPX and some of the other
models<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> canopy<00:00:54.690> off

bulleted blades I'm supposed to be a
little<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:25.740> stable<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
little more stable I don't really like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.230 
little more stable I don't really like
them<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> normal<00:01:27.570> weight<00:01:29.240> here

if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:30.710> closely<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.549> see

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
if you look closely in there you can see

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
if you look closely in there you can see
the<00:01:33.570> main<00:01:33.810> brushless<00:01:34.170> motor<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> head<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.799> a

the main brushless motor the head is a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
the main brushless motor the head is a
little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.640> beefier<00:01:42.140> see<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> brushless

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
little bit beefier see the brushless

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.499 
little bit beefier see the brushless
mane<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.790> long<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.540> long

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.200 

see<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> inside<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:59.210> couple

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
see the inside a little bit a couple

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
see the inside a little bit a couple
things<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.679> about<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.100> model

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
things I really like about this model

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
things I really like about this model
and<00:02:02.670> dislike<00:02:03.539> about<00:02:03.569> this<00:02:03.899> model<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.649> thing<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and dislike about this model one thing I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.389 
and dislike about this model one thing I
really<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.840> tons<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> power<00:02:07.399> it's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
really like is just tons of power it's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.130 
really like is just tons of power it's
just<00:02:08.549> got<00:02:08.670> power

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
just got power

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
just got power
a<00:02:10.140> couple<00:02:10.679> things<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.390> gyro

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
a couple things I don't like is the gyro

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.640 
a couple things I don't like is the gyro
is<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.590> bit<00:02:13.920> too<00:02:14.129> sensitive

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.949 

if<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.040> don't<00:02:17.299> initialize<00:02:18.299> this<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
if you don't initialize this with it

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.479 
if you don't initialize this with it
laying<00:02:19.140> perfectly<00:02:19.379> flat<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.129> wiggle

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
laying perfectly flat and don't wiggle

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.070 
laying perfectly flat and don't wiggle
it<00:02:20.610> at<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.860> it's<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:23.160> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> fly<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:24.080> so

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it at all it's not going to fly right so

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.360 
it at all it's not going to fly right so
you<00:02:25.140> got<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.410> try<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.010> down<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you got to try to put it down on

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
you got to try to put it down on
something<00:02:26.579> very<00:02:26.760> flat<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.750> service<00:02:28.079> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
something very flat like the service is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.059 
something very flat like the service is
on<00:02:28.349> here<00:02:29.450> plug<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.690> battery<00:02:31.069> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
on here plug in the battery it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.280 
on here plug in the battery it
initializes<00:02:32.599> extremely<00:02:33.599> fast<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.079> can't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
initializes extremely fast so you can't

pick<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.950> plug<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.549> put<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.940> down<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
pick it up and plug it in put it down I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.710 
pick it up and plug it in put it down I
wish<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.879> could<00:02:39.000> turn<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> gyro

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
wish I could turn down the gyro

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.150 
wish I could turn down the gyro

this class by probably quite a bit makes
the<00:03:00.870> Nano<00:03:01.200> look<00:03:01.440> like<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> slowpoke<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.560> tail

something<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.579> wanted<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.849> point<00:03:24.060> out<00:03:24.269> about

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
something I wanted to point out about

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.949 
something I wanted to point out about
the<00:03:24.660> tail<00:03:24.900> or<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.540> vertical<00:03:27.919> spin<00:03:28.919> I<00:03:29.959> was

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the tail or the vertical spin I was

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.190 
the tail or the vertical spin I was
flying<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.769> backyard<00:03:32.660> came<00:03:33.660> down<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> low

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
flying in the backyard came down a low

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.569 
flying in the backyard came down a low
blows<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> ground<00:03:34.799> kind<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.250> tapped<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
blows to the ground kind of tapped the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.520 
blows to the ground kind of tapped the
ground<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.849> little<00:03:36.030> bit<00:03:36.209> very<00:03:36.389> lightly<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
ground a little bit very lightly it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.890 
ground a little bit very lightly it
caused<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.370> stabilizer<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.269> spin<00:03:39.569> sideways

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
caused this stabilizer to spin sideways

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.349 
caused this stabilizer to spin sideways
and<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.829> happened<00:03:41.160> was<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.489> caught<00:03:41.669> my<00:03:41.880> tail

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
and what happened was it caught my tail

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.270 
and what happened was it caught my tail
rotor<00:03:42.599> blade<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.620> totally<00:03:43.799> stopped

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
rotor blade on to it and totally stopped

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.940 
rotor blade on to it and totally stopped
it<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.269> when<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:45.510> happens<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.590> heli<00:03:46.739> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
it so when that happens the heli to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.440 
it so when that happens the heli to
start<00:03:47.160> spinning<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> control

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
start spinning out of control

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.809 
start spinning out of control
and<00:03:48.859> you<00:03:49.859> can<00:03:49.980> guess<00:03:50.129> what<00:03:50.310> happens<00:03:50.609> after

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and you can guess what happens after

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.479 
and you can guess what happens after
that<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.900> what<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> did<00:03:52.829> was<00:03:52.950> take<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.129> little<00:03:53.400> bit

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
that so what I did was take a little bit

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.159 
that so what I did was take a little bit
of<00:03:53.579> superglue<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.209> little<00:03:54.480> notch<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.019> back

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
of superglue on little notch on the back

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.420 
of superglue on little notch on the back
of<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.379> stabilizer<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.450> snap<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.599> in<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
of a stabilizer and snap it in like that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.360 
of a stabilizer and snap it in like that
yep<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.879> held<00:04:00.090> very<00:04:00.419> solid<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.680> don't<00:04:02.220> think

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
yep in a held very solid I don't think

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.650 
yep in a held very solid I don't think
that<00:04:02.459> will<00:04:02.579> happen<00:04:02.669> again<00:04:03.090> shouldn't<00:04:03.539> be<00:04:03.630> a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
that will happen again shouldn't be a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.990 
that will happen again shouldn't be a
problem<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.169> could<00:04:04.769> take<00:04:04.919> this<00:04:05.070> off<00:04:05.310> too<00:04:05.639> and

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
problem you could take this off too and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.530 
problem you could take this off too and
then<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.239> kind<00:04:06.419> of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
then it kind of

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.809 
then it kind of
risks<00:04:06.840> from<00:04:07.049> exposing<00:04:07.590> your<00:04:07.980> tail<00:04:08.159> other<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
risks from exposing your tail other and

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.819 
risks from exposing your tail other and
I<00:04:09.599> kind<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.379> bit<00:04:10.530> for<00:04:10.709> like

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
I kind of like it a little bit for like

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.789 
I kind of like it a little bit for like
you<00:04:11.579> know<00:04:11.609> orientation<00:04:12.540> purposes<00:04:15.799> this

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
you know orientation purposes this

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.110

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.950 
7.4 volt lithium polymer battery 30 C it
puts<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.199> really<00:04:28.650> nice<00:04:28.830> punch<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.960> really

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
puts out a really nice punch I really

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.960 
puts out a really nice punch I really
like<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.229> battery<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.800> would<00:04:32.430> probably<00:04:32.610> stick

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
like the battery I would probably stick

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.310 
like the battery I would probably stick
with<00:04:33.000> E<00:04:33.240> flat<00:04:33.449> batteries<00:04:33.870> I'm<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.110> going<00:04:34.259> to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
with E flat batteries I'm not going to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.560 
with E flat batteries I'm not going to
go<00:04:34.410> off-brand<00:04:34.949> on<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.310> model<00:04:35.669> because<00:04:36.389> it

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
go off-brand on this model because it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.330 
go off-brand on this model because it
takes<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:36.930> much<00:04:37.080> power<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.740> I'm<00:04:37.830> afraid<00:04:38.039> if<00:04:38.250> I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
takes so much power and I'm afraid if I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.580 
takes so much power and I'm afraid if I
go<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.940> an<00:04:39.090> off-brand<00:04:39.479> or<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> 25<00:04:40.169> C<00:04:40.440> or

go to an off-brand or a 25 C or
