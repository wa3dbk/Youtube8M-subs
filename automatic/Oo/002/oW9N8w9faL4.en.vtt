00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you guys right now I don't see anything

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.090 
you guys right now I don't see anything
in<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> source<00:00:21.990> code<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.650> anything<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
in the source code or anything like that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640 
in the source code or anything like that
so<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> lot<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> people<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.380> thinking

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so what a lot of people are thinking

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790 
so what a lot of people are thinking
though<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.869> means<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
though is that this means that this

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.510 
though is that this means that this
could<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.640> end<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.890> finance<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> phrase<00:00:32.219> 3

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
could be the end of finance a phrase 3

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.650 
could be the end of finance a phrase 3
because<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> fact<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.559> um<00:00:35.329> well<00:00:36.329> there's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
because of the fact that um well there's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.740 
because of the fact that um well there's
there's<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.829> there's<00:00:38.219> nothing<00:00:38.629> there's<00:00:39.629> no

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there's not there's nothing there's no

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
there's not there's nothing there's no
secret<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:40.770> no<00:00:40.920> people<00:00:41.399> are

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
saying that you know maybe the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
saying that you know maybe the
backlights<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.469> something<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.340> have

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

some<00:00:44.789> sort<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.000> secret<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> them

some sort of secret in them

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
some sort of secret in them
I<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
I don't really think so I think that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.590 
I don't really think so I think that
this<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.989> means<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.800> over<00:00:50.360> now<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this just means that it's over now this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
this just means that it's over now this
isn't<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.020> straight<00:00:52.590> confirmation<00:00:53.309> because

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
isn't a straight confirmation because

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010 
isn't a straight confirmation because
you<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.000> Scott<00:00:54.239> doesn't<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.870> say

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you know Scott doesn't like to just say

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380 
you know Scott doesn't like to just say
things<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.469> hey<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> games<00:00:56.280> over<00:00:56.550> guys<00:00:56.579> get

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
things like hey the games over guys get

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
things like hey the games over guys get
just<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.730> think

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
just just get out of here no but I think

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
just just get out of here no but I think
that<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> symbol

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that this just it's kind of a symbol

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210 
that this just it's kind of a symbol
that<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.570> might<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:04.080> over<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.739> if

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that it might just be over because if

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
that it might just be over because if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this could more this could I think this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
this could more this could I think this
might<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:30.000> mean<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.200> it's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
might just be mean that you know it's

might just be mean that you know it's
over<00:01:31.799> now<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:33.600> does<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.900> mean<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.560> terms<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
over now what does this mean in terms of

over now what does this mean in terms of
Scott<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.470> he's<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.310> on

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
Scott I think he's gonna probably go on

Scott I think he's gonna probably go on
to<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> new<00:01:38.759> series<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.650> if

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it even means over now this could just

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
don't know but from what I'm seeing
right<00:02:45.689> now<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:46.139> signs<00:02:46.379> are<00:02:46.439> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> pointing

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
right now all signs are kind of pointing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.789 
right now all signs are kind of pointing
to<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.609> fact<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.879> this<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:49.200> last<00:02:49.590> game

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
to the fact that this is the last game

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.710 
to the fact that this is the last game
in<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.010> series<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.639> we<00:02:50.819> don't<00:02:51.000> know<00:02:51.090> guys<00:02:51.299> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
in the series but we don't know guys so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.390 
in the series but we don't know guys so
like<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.959> said<00:02:52.139> before<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.069> lot<00:02:53.099> we

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like I said before there's a lot we

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.949 
like I said before there's a lot we
don't<00:02:53.549> know<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.909> keep<00:02:54.180> repeating<00:02:54.419> myself<00:02:54.540> but

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
don't know I keep repeating myself but

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.050 
don't know I keep repeating myself but
it's<00:02:55.169> true<00:02:55.379> so<00:02:55.680> hopefully<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.760> isn't<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it's true so hopefully this isn't the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's true so hopefully this isn't the
last<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.419> though<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.560> know

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
it's it's been a pretty long series it's

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.569 
it's it's been a pretty long series it's
been<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> pretty<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.049> one<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.579> yeah
