00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 they will have difficulties with the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.439
 regulate how they show you now 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.900

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.220
 you either need oatmeal that you can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 you make yourselves or you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 Use the instant you find 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 for who macher us in muscle 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 shop.de 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.680
 we just do it ourselves 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 completely oatmeal him and make 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.489
 I'm here in the blender to oatmeal 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 just the whole thing is just going on 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 if you have such strong mixa ratz fatz 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 12 minutes and you see the whole thing 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.629
 is like mail 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 I am now in a bowl 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 always put some cinnamon on top of it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.500
 Eighth is simply the better cinnamon 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 for that and then of course we use 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 protein powder also finds the link 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.430
 her under this video we use 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.620
 Here are two poles coups very important 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 because so naturally a protein share 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 so cover everything back on top 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 clear 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.119
 stir once you see that already 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 everything is very small and very fine exactly 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.920
 that's the way it should be and now something else 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.170
 cashew butter is megal eckert and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 ground cashews that have 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.759
 Of course a lot of protein but also him 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 very much important fatty acids of it 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.299
 calmly strong what to give her missing 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 the exact amount of course again 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 What you recommend recommend strawberry

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.479

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 200 milliliters you can too 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.920
 normal low-fat milk also use 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.229
 no problem stir once vigorously 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 and really right above stir and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 that there is no bun 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 you have to do it all for about 23 now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.920
 minutes 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.439
 that looks like this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 tastes good too that tastes good 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.740
 You can definitely eat so already 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.040

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.930
 pass the whole of the dough should 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.670
 even two inches thick be distributed 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.590
 you just keep it even 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.250
 baking tray is already called the oven 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 in front 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.890
 at medium temperature for about 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.530
 the title is five to a maximum of ten minutes 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.600
