00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.279
 world quite without help pretty juicy 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 delicious on-going bread and that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 we go to romrod with yogurt and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.970
 with carbon in it and that's so easy 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.270
 Let's see how I like this great 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.719
 prepared bread then just stay 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 tuned 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.620
 We start with flour first and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.570
 Although I suppose I only 630 but think 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.629
 I can wholemeal which has my hair 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.469
 you can strengthen me next to your own 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 as you like 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.079
 we need 500 grams 30 degrees falls 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 lose weight and take it to another 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.910
 do more and accept more 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 a packet baking powder give that one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.460
 completely in here and then we go 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.869
 We take a bit of soda 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 he for example at dm and take of it 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.460
 we surround ourselves with half a teaspoon 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.220
 is also the chicken wrestling after all 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.750
 mix that once properly because 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 maybe that would be 7 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.299
 good and long after all 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.420
 second bowl and give us once 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.009
 say something to mix namely hd 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.390
 from last time banks have said again 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 mix but I'll do it with you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 Once yourself and you can then 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 take sesame and I take a lot 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:43.610
 sesame i like you are about 60 readers 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.409
 make and then we give sunflowers 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.500
 and 250 grams of sunflower seeds resp 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:57.149
 top 50 come then I take something else 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.920
 sesame I also think that's delicious 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.500
 already enough in there but I take something 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.890
 black sesame and of it but namely 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.329
 Not too much about ten grams 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 you do not have to do it clean writes too 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.990
 if the other two have and then 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.010
 go 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.140
 here we have a tablespoon here 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.090
 you can also do stuff like that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.200
 month to give or lion should also give 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.420
 Next , accept more than 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.730
 Replacement for 200 grams only in brock times 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.280
 there are two and they will be once 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.830
 peeled into pieces and cut 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.540
 then they are rubbed down once 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.670
 and most important is that you are the fine 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.170
 rub your big pieces in bread 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.510
 For example, these are the children 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.700
 who are already huge in the race 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.800
 there is no room for learning 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.800
 makes sense to train these little ones too 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.290
 hide and the carrots come 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.290
 just in a bowl 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.640
 Now we need yogurt in the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.710
 current edge is namely lactose-free 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.290
 yogurt and that is turkish boy and 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.720
 Active free one kilo for the price 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.720
 lactose free so actually works better 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.940
 Not 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.310
 and we need 350 grams of yogurt the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.680
 important network off and then we go here 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.960
 another egg that mixes everything 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.820
 will be on the 2nd smooth mass and then 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.470
 If I see my mail then it would be 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.470
 however, half of the pages were filmed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.590
 and you see now what you put them 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.150
 how you just miserable all these 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.940
 lumps in it that I do not have in your 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.110
 I would like to have bread in it now 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.150
 my mother here 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.940
 I already emailed you one and you 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 it looks pretty wet and that is 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.550
 completely okay so still emily 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.090
 a bit of all sides where I am one 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.660
 knead a bit and beauty 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.150
 then we can give shape 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.970
 next on the baking sheet do not foil 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.650
 get more high so we can get one 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.750
 bit unhappy as on 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 morning 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.780
 then it will look better and I'll do it 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.410
 Here I give it a bowl with 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.269
 Drain water and brush the bread 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.290
 now here 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.260
 For the simple reason I still have 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.990
 the sides mix the rest of it 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.840
 and that is simply equal-turvy 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.010
 sprinkled and tapped with water 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.010
 just thinks it's best 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.610
 and then an oven preheated have 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.380
 at 180 degrees and that will be easy 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.389
 then bake everything 40 june 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.580
 Our buddy looks like that and that is 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.710
 a huge delicious one kilo bread 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.539
 and 40 minutes circulated 180 degrees and you 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.340
 Just look how nice gold need that 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.199
 has become public torn up 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.639
 who would have thought that would lift 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.280
 I already drive to the minister 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.370
 be made and no yeast in it 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.440
 and you just look wonderful 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.070
 I 'm looking forward to that 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.410
 to eat 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.750
 now it has to cool down a bit and 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.400
 I take a picture for you and then I am 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.200
 I get out that's it again 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.940
 Apart from that, it's super easy to shut up 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.580
 weight just all ingredients of course 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.860
 throw together the grotto people in a row 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.960
