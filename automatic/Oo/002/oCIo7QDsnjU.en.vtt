00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.440
 it's good that they stayed because 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:16.119
 we continue with the doctor career 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.119
 and we're also going to make a rich post 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 because if this gastronomy 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.590
 notice that I always wanted to have had a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.780
 store where we were going as children and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 my dream was to put a hotel and I wanted 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.260
 that the kitchen was black and a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 little hotel like five rooms and this and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 I wanted to have it already is planned that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 there would be peeled pistachios in the bar with 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 she had all my stuff and I wanted 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.809
 study astronomy to open this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.670
 place and they believe that the changarro which 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.940
 suddenly a man and I got the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 commented I am the owner of the hotel and I 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 so to that place was my vacation to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.750
 sound of this fate and then nutrition and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.660
 I left wishing I will soon 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.100
 study the races more 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.600
 hijole who is of all I stay a lot 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.790
 for living this from getting to sight 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 Grandma 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.720
 hear the ingredients of this recipe 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.720
 We are going to use 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.300
 two cups of cooked rice half a cup of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
 sugar three tablespoons of corn starch 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.190
 a quarter of a tablespoon of salt two yolks 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.170
 of egg one and a half cup of milk 1 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.300
 cup of coconut milk 100 grams of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.010
 cocos hydrated a spoonful of essence

 of vanilla a quarter of a tablespoon of 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.290
 ground cinnamon and a half cup of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.080
 chopped pistachios with an average of truth 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.970
 let's make a mix let's mix 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.420
 there the sugar 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.420
 Writer 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.970
 pq the scale 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.250
 there is a little bit of salt 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.210
 I'm going to put in the eggs 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:24.200
 i 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:28.440
 8 meanwhile if your furniture and while 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.830
 I'm going to put the two milks here 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.900
 what 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.110
 grass and that incorporate 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.120
 You pass me a spatula please to see 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.709
 plans but we will not play they came back 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.709
 to two and three spatulas 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.100
 the technique is like this 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.670
 better a spatula 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.110
 with force with force 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:14.519
 the patient teaches you to grab the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.530
 The most authentic surgeons are the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.170
 creditors those who operate who are 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.730
 accustomed as spatula says and the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.730
 disease gives them the spatula but 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.950
 very hard done they are heard they will drink blow 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.950
 that the surgeon holds her very tight 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:36.240
 a very firm surgeon are very firm those 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.580
 very cold surgeons 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.730
 If you have to do something just like that 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.730
 do not 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.050
 they are butchers 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.740
 yes 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.390
 my uncle's surgeon if abertzale East 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.520
 value of each the starch we go to 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 Mix 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.040
 everything will incorporate 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.569
 your father 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.049
 it's fathers and mothers we did and if he's a father 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.109
 children are not very difficult to operate 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.329
 in fact to hit children you have to 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.030
 do pediatrics first what is going to do 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.000
 pediatric surgery spend four more years 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.410
 and they put the most difficult surgery is the most 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.919
 socially I would not have to ask before 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:32.740
 thing but if you put several surgeons 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:34.060
 which would be the kindest good but that 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.060
 I believe that the one that has to be more 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.400
 precise the neurosurgeon can not 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.310
 again they enter the brain in the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.840
 brain you have to have a precision 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.160
 millimeter and really all the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.710
 surgeons good without a precision 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.320
 millimeter if they have it and then with the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.060
 new robots there are incredible 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.660
 yes plastic surgeons also 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.060
 obviously not good they are better you 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.280
 do not stay like loquitos we are not going to 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.360
 add here the rice alberto already touches you 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.969
 ability 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.990
 We put the rice rice cooked 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:12.219
 steam ok and let's also add 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.219
 vanilla 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.110
 We took to school and it had taken you 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:26.000
 we're going to put cinnamon that issues this 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.620
 Filmax and aphrodisiac production 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.090
 Vanilla good is what it says of 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.280
 newell's 3 in that province 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.030
 I the aphrodisiac more more more more 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.630
 scientifically verifiable the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.630
 blue pill 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.300
 Gioja no back hey, let's 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.300
 put this here 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.810
 I do not know how you like it 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.680
 these puddings I like them like that and 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.160
 oldies 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.600
 and in what we put we put it 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.100
 Quick 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.690
 let's put it very rich is not good 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.720
 already stain dish allow it to be cleaned 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.180
 to have the decoration that will happen 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.460
 he's a surgeon and I said it's super 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.430
 obsessive about cleaning without 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.810
 after a good one drop depends depends 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:30.020
 What if you go to France and raft 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.720
 they saw if it's crazy or I try 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.430
 you contain a lot of time and that 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.310
 sir as long as you do not touch the elevator 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.080
 because she got dirty she screamed seated and 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.910
 we have to go look for it in the 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.010
 ball because to climb the 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.400
 chef and he will lower this lesson on 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.410
 exaggerated if yes I had if I had some 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.780
 rolls there are very impressive to wash 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.640
 much the hands the hay greeted with 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.350
 this porte puts the focus to say hello or 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.500
 whether someone is going to exaggerate you now 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.930
 I know kitchens that in a month there are 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.940
 everything in the vineyard of the lord and here the 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.550
 corner post imagine 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:09.720
 the corner posts of the games 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.730
 If I am sure that we are more demanding 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.419
 As with your good we will put fast 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.270
 the little bit of coconut we're going to splash 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.919
 with a little pistache and Now 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.340
 with these we are going to see the following 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.340
 information
