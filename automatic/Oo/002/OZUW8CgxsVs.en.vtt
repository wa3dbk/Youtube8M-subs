00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Maori
and Pacific Island students

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.040
from the University of Auckland

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.920
are voicing their opinions
on racism.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.200
They say it affects them
substantially in their pursuit

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
of tertiary education.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.480
Raniera Harrison
caught up with the students

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880
making a stand against racism.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.040
A collective of students addressing

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.360
the crippling disease creeping
through our universities.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.600
I, Too, Am Auckland
is a social experiment

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.320
conducted by students of Maori
and Pacific Island descent

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.840
at The University Of Auckland.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.840
But the study
led by Dr. David Mayeda,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.360
its online presence
has raised questions.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.880
The benefits were seen overseas,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.120
so much so that it was decided
to do the same here.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.200
Which led the School of Social
Sciences at the university

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.960
to critically analyse this
phenomenon sweeping their people.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.840
And their series of videos online
amassed more than 30,000 views

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.200
in the first week.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.600
There's words of advice
to those being hurt by racism.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.240
So no one else has to bear
the brunt of racism.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.800
