yourself<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.740> thought<00:00:23.519> once<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.789> gets<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
yourself I thought once he gets the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
yourself I thought once he gets the
fifty<00:00:24.390> percent<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> fight<00:00:25.380> changes<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
fifty percent of how the fight changes a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
fifty percent of how the fight changes a
little<00:00:26.039> bit<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> brought<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.779> my

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

little bit so what I brought for my
special<00:00:28.349> ability<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.220> critique<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
special ability is critique because

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530 
special ability is critique because
every<00:00:31.019> time<00:00:31.050> he<00:00:31.500> uses<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.189> bluff<00:00:33.000> he's<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
every time he uses a bluff he's going to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
every time he uses a bluff he's going to
take<00:00:33.719> damage<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.380> since<00:00:34.770> he's<00:00:34.920> copying<00:00:35.340> my

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
take damage and since he's copying my

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
take damage and since he's copying my
attacks<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.180> could<00:00:36.780> spam<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.140> bluff<00:00:37.380> three

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
attacks I could spam my bluff three

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.100 
attacks I could spam my bluff three
times<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.340> him<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> hurt<00:00:39.000> himself<00:00:39.110> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
times and get him to hurt himself and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
times and get him to hurt himself and
then<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> could<00:00:40.469> drink<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.920> couple<00:00:41.129> times<00:00:41.460> in

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
then I could drink a couple times in

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
then I could drink a couple times in
he'll<00:00:41.850> trick<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.210> well<00:00:42.390> until<00:00:42.690> he<00:00:42.750> gets<00:00:42.899> fifty

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
he'll trick as well until he gets fifty

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
he'll trick as well until he gets fifty
percent<00:00:43.530> health<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.640> he's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> 50-percent

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
percent health so now he's a 50-percent

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.209 
percent health so now he's a 50-percent
house<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:45.960> putting<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> buff<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.710> himself<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
house he's putting a buff on himself and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
house he's putting a buff on himself and
what<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.300> basically<00:00:48.780> blocks<00:00:49.500> my

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
what this does is it basically blocks my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
what this does is it basically blocks my
Bluffs<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> bluff<00:00:52.170> now

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
because I have no other option I don't

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.540 
because I have no other option I don't
take<00:00:55.079> damage<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.770> bluff<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.460> it

so you have to play around with him
mimicking<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.840> attacks<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.950> he

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
mimicking your attacks and then when he

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
mimicking your attacks and then when he

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
attacks and take advantage of that now

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030

this<00:01:42.720> fight<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.259> close<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
this fight was pretty close this is the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
this fight was pretty close this is the
second<00:01:44.369> time<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.579> beat<00:01:44.820> him<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> row<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.960> i

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
second time I beat him in a row so i

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
second time I beat him in a row so i
felt<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.530> had<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.799> strategy<00:01:47.250> down<00:01:47.430> pretty

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
felt like i had the strategy down pretty

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
felt like i had the strategy down pretty
well<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.890> he

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
putting on his buff and then I could

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.330 
putting on his buff and then I could
take<00:02:32.239> advantage<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.780> him<00:02:33.050> either<00:02:33.650> copying<00:02:34.220> my
