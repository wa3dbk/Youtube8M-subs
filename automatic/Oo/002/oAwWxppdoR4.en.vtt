00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.329
 and in particular we will deal with the rr rm this acronym is simply for 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.310

 of the tests 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 recovery is barley at the speed that is thought to be 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.030

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.040
 marathon and so I have a fortnight beautiful we say from 15 to 30 seconds to 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.950
 slow 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 compared to that is marathon speed 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.550
 lee to make an example moon a subject that was there 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820

 recovering a thousand acquastep 20 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.720
 photo is a job that the first few times especially extremely difficult 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.780
 however so all the rich aerobic power you have that the teacher nismo ad 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.600
 accustom 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810
 I can also use fats 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.180
 used to metabolize use also 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.009
 in the product room 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.600
 which is not the quantity of mint 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 burn and then austin races at the most that yesterday eyelash of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.710
 utilization 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.570
 hey baby login on the violin muscle 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.180
 training for the marathon because it is not high intensity 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.260
 which very much also brought mental power to the very important 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.810
 why create 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.550
 familiar with the return to now and that gives and obviously the greatest 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.479
