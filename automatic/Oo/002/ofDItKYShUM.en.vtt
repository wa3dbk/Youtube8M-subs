looks<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> old<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.940> only

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
looks like the old one and the only

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
looks like the old one and the only
thing<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.680> custom<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
thing it don't like for this custom is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.150 
thing it don't like for this custom is
that<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.940> tank<00:00:51.360> hardly<00:00:51.809> doesn't<00:00:52.800> match<00:00:52.920> with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that this tank hardly doesn't match with

that this tank hardly doesn't match with
this<00:00:53.370> tan<00:00:53.610> color<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.510> really

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this tan color because it's really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.310 
this tan color because it's really
difficult<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.410> print<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:57.000> tan<00:00:57.570> color<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.260> a

difficult to print a tan color on a
darker<00:00:58.980> color<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.300> legs<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:00.960> bit

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
darker color the legs are a little bit

dark blue sprung and then this calendar
doesn't<00:01:04.439> match<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.360> problem

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
doesn't match and it's the only problem
