00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
I would buy it for sure I think that you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.740 
I would buy it for sure I think that you
there's<00:01:49.880> something<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.270> changes<00:01:50.600> or

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
there's something that changes or

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.170 
there's something that changes or
through<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:52.160> think<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:53.000> should<00:01:53.120> do

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
through it that is I think you should do

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.760 
through it that is I think you should do
that<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.330> bit<00:01:53.540> too<00:01:53.720> much<00:01:53.900> but<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.500> think<00:01:54.680> you

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
that a bit too much but I think you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.990 
that a bit too much but I think you
could<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.070> make<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.430> little<00:01:55.550> bit<00:01:55.850> more

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
could just make it a little bit more

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.810 
could just make it a little bit more
special<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.630> would<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:57.320> really<00:01:57.500> well<00:01:57.640> yeah

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
special and it would do really well yeah

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.969 
special and it would do really well yeah
