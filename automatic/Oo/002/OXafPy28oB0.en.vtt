00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.630
 lohmann gets hold of the tree 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.220
 ten minutes of fortification video 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.779
 Today I just want the weapon 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.210
 you just seen grad already in the trailer 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.800
 So imagine the opera and you 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.060
 read a bit stats the whole 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.670
 The thing is available through the new one 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.140
 through the new dlc devastation and her 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.269
 Keep it even when you're on the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.830
 xbox gambled and bought the season pass 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.900
 actually already has 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.659
 So now come to the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.640
 sketch the whole thing is to be found 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.570
 under the mps so while you are 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.790
 with great power looks on 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.830
 machine pistols because the whole is from 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.720
 mobility and handling 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.580
 just like a submachine gun you 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.019
 For example, no stalker is needed 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.699
 It is not necessary like for example 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.600
 in the soffin so storm rifle and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.960
 in my opinion 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.330
 and that's why you can find all under 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 mps to the magazine you have to say that 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.710
 Magazine capacity is limited to 32 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.630
 if you do not have external texas 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.409
 it worked on 48 magazine 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.100
 expandable 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.500
 in smg mode you need three to five 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.039
 hits three to five hits with the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.320
 Bullet 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.350
 so that the opponents dry if you that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.840
 all in Ostrava truffle mode to provide 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.219
 So in storm rifle mode then needs 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.890
 her only three to four hits that 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.520
 is just the higher 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.479
 impact of a storm rifle 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.219
 Just keep the range 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.109
 but you have a lot for that 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.630
 slow shot advice so if you that 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.210
 whole thing as a storm rifle zockt 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.159
 Do you have the slowest shooting? 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.149
 assault rifle a whole call of duty great 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.139
 is even slower while only sinking 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.389
 minimal wise comparable to the 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:57.369
 The final installment of remington made that happen 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:59.789
 whole thing as a submachine gun 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 widen the shot per minute 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.969
 925 are for comparison as a songwriter 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 615 shot per minute so hedge it 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.959
 Of course we always have one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.090
 shot less takes but the whole 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.819
 To sum it up is a good mp 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 and once you get the whole thing up 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.340
 Stormgun represents it is more for the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.450
 range thought as you from 1 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.599
 nitrate which also helps that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.890
 whole thing keeps calm and on melee 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.379
 Of course I would recommend that to you 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 Unpack the machine pistol and yes that 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.890
 whole was actually already before 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.840
 I hope you liked that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.829
 short video today you the whole again 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.959
 to illustrate 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.959
 So mr. 1000 euro marcel t
