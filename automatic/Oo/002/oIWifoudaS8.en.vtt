 Little lamb, we'll risk it on the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.150
 Mold leaving room for sewing goes 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.190

 mine has to agree with you, I 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.180

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.410
 vodafone this question is cuddly in the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.360
 my childhood this probe for a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.290
 vita's birthday too for me 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.660
 to know the first book of life is then 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.180
 We're going to put this guinea mission here. 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.490
 have several options on the market that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.530
 articulated eyes and such but I prefer 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.050
 When it comes to things the child has 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.800
 of making her nail dine with the line of 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.140
 Kite 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.620
 It's dangerous here to put it in the mouth. 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.420
 so I prefer to ensure putting 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.950
 a safer way, huh? 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.540
 so here we are going to learn little eyes. 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.000
 if we will do a little more 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.770

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.989
 the ear is very simple 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.000
 touch, we 're in the right way, okay? 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.000
 seeing leave room for the seam to say 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.920
 or else it's a little bit late the day after 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.080
 We'll pucker this up. 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.030

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.300
 After taking off from there we'll make the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.860

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.110

 to make the mouths in this line of 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.540
