00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.319
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.240
 this tutorial 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.400
 this is the seventeenth partner new 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 sap script him tutorial row and on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.110
 these media, if it's not about it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 take care that we have these bots in eg 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.740
 a harmonious or on a pizza 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 We're in charge of that too 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.890
 by inserting the script as we do that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.490
 Now we want to do it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689
 with the function set player shop nature 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 employ 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.179
 and I have a page here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 called because the are all shop 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.710
 named this is what we listed 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.149
 Of course, once in harmonious 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 we have to use this one here 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 and once our pizza pizza load the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 we already integrated in the script 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.440
 and have that in front here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.469
 quotation marks is the value that we 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 always so we need that now 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.530
 not every time you enter command 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.030
 always have to wear is what 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.350
 We're adding a load at all 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 Just up here in our buildings 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.719
 a pure reason why we do behind the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.489
 terrier still a split and say 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.280
 b hotmail and we already have 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 Just seen that it is a text 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 we have to sing that as a drink 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.479
 and we'll see how long it is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 yes, I guess when we are 15 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.189
 sign beside that you can do that 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.570
 of course, see how many characters 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.619
 that really has that maximum and then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 takes just the number I take 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 I'm just 15 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.619
 Of course we have to go down here now 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.210
 in our interviews we already 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 or respectively our input and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 At the end we have to do something about it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.299
 I am writing now 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.350
 first behind what ever for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.700
 one was not so with it 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.780
 getting together so the first one was 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.610
 months of the type he leads in the first 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.030
 interview there are different and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 the second was a pizza i think 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 just better write this way behind 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 behind the last time he's for ours 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.439
 We have to stand in the b interior now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.040
 of course, both the shop name 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.750
 enter 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.390
 I'll get that from the list here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.899
 once we have people 1 that is then 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 in quotation marks amon 1 and at 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.490
 Pizza load sfd pizza 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 and if we compile it all now 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.700
 Let's see we do not get any 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.930
 error 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 however, that would still be so 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.690
 we do not have to bring much now 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.520
 namely back to our enter command 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.020
 go and then even a bear that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.680
 We are in the right place 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:41.820
 shop to be set so z player 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:47.790
 shop name player id and then how info b 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.980
 shopping so that means we would 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.340
 now in the space given here 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.200
 specified in this shop 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.700
 to be used as it were this shop 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 Mode that botta behind the counter 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.450
 stands and so on and so forth 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 and we do it now first on 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.160
 people and if we do not have one 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.660
 do not want so if we have now 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 an interior simply an inter access 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.020
 make point where there is not such a 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.910
 shop mode gives then we leave this here 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.040
 just free back so then we leave 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.019
 either the quotes free or 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.790
 It can even be that one completely 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.459
 you can omit then yes we see you 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.120
 So you can leave it out completely 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.290
 I will write it here again 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.420
 again so that we also load the pc 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 get demonstrated the same way or 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.380
 we compile the whole and can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.380
 once the foot start the server 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.290
 so are connected now and I think so 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.100
 me an export here again and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.820
 run now to our nation amo 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.840
 and she just goes in with inter 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.000
 and now we'll see you again 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.900
 See a seller here too 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.450
 we go there as normal and we can 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.140
 just like in the singleplayer 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.140
 buy weapons 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 Of course we can do the same 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.750
 The pizza always load so from the meter 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.670
 long and we see the pizza is loading 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.730
 not a seller and that means we 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.840
 still have a mistake somewhere like that 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.239
 error is here, of course 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.980
 i have a double written i 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.470
 compiled the whole started again 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.840
 server so i 'm going back here now 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.550
 in and now we are here again 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.650
 our best seller we also in the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.910
 singleplayer no good that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.590
 water net times for this part of the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.870
 tutorials of wheat relatively short 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.250
 ride for that was so short now 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.330
 now comes the next patch and 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.620
 within the next few days as is 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.780
 not again ten days, but me 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.340
 wait cold and still had school but 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.200
 now this video is coming up now and 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.660
 once this is somehow fair 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.400
 100-150 has calls then comes the same 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.200
 the next party therefore in which it then 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.650
 will probably go to 3d texte 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.950
 and how to enter buildings with buttons 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.210
 can 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.460
 I still have to watch which one 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.270
 order me to do that well then say 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.390
 I only times goodbye and to 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.390
 next
