00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
volume up we have the stereo speakers

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.780 
volume up we have the stereo speakers
here<00:06:36.720> on<00:06:36.840> both<00:06:37.020> sides<00:06:37.320> of<00:06:37.530> the<00:06:37.650> tabla

its<00:06:52.700> rivals<00:06:53.180> but<00:06:53.870> that's<00:06:54.320> the<00:06:54.470> price<00:06:54.680> we<00:06:54.800> have

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
its rivals but that's the price we have

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.520 
its rivals but that's the price we have
to<00:06:54.980> pay<00:06:55.100> for<00:06:55.280> light<00:06:55.850> and<00:06:56.120> slim<00:06:56.510> we<00:06:57.050> will<00:06:57.230> say

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
to pay for light and slim we will say

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.710 
to pay for light and slim we will say
that<00:06:57.740> this<00:06:57.980> is<00:06:58.160> a<00:06:58.190> terribly<00:06:58.639> low<00:06:58.820> battery<00:06:59.240> life

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
that this is a terribly low battery life

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.020 
that this is a terribly low battery life
quite<00:07:00.650> the<00:07:00.680> contrary<00:07:00.980> and<00:07:01.520> it<00:07:01.730> should<00:07:01.910> be

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
quite the contrary and it should be

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.580 
quite the contrary and it should be
sufficient<00:07:02.480> for<00:07:02.510> a<00:07:02.660> few<00:07:02.840> day<00:07:02.990> of<00:07:03.080> heavy<00:07:03.320> use
