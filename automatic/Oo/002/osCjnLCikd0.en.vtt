00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so that guy heard me tried to flash me

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.790 
so that guy heard me tried to flash me
but<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.780> go<00:02:10.959> back<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.440> what<00:02:11.620> do<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.709> know

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800

but I go back and what do you know
they're<00:02:12.100> coming<00:02:12.459> back<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:13.300> try<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> kill<00:02:13.810> me<00:02:14.520> so

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
they're coming back to try to kill me so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.850 
they're coming back to try to kill me so
why<00:02:16.000> not<00:02:16.180> patrol<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:16.690> area<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.620> only

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
why not patrol this area the only

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.500 
why not patrol this area the only
downfall<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.730> sometimes<00:02:19.209> you'll

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
downfall with this is sometimes you'll

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.750 
downfall with this is sometimes you'll
get<00:02:19.709> gangbanged<00:02:20.709> from<00:02:21.040> two<00:02:21.220> different<00:02:21.400> sides

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
get gangbanged from two different sides

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.610 
get gangbanged from two different sides
and<00:02:22.180> you'll<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.900> really<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.440> throw

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and you'll just really want to throw

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
and you'll just really want to throw
yourself<00:02:24.040> off<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.310> cliff<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:27.450> occasionally

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
yourself off a cliff but occasionally

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.449 
yourself off a cliff but occasionally
that's<00:02:28.780> why<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.020> using<00:02:29.350> rapid<00:02:30.100> fire

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
that's why I like using rapid fire

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.250 
that's why I like using rapid fire
because<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.270> usually<00:02:31.390> handle<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.170> know

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260

so I am a trihard that usually but in

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.190 
so I am a trihard that usually but in
competitive<00:03:01.300> play<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:04.480> Russian<00:03:04.930> crush

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
competitive play the Russian crush

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.470 
competitive play the Russian crush
method<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.310> best<00:03:06.580> because<00:03:06.970> it's<00:03:07.360> not

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
method is the best because it's not

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
method is the best because it's not
going<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.690> matter<00:03:07.780> how<00:03:08.050> many<00:03:08.200> times<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.530> die

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
going to matter how many times you die

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.600 
going to matter how many times you die
the<00:03:09.880> more<00:03:10.060> traffic<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:11.110> see<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.530> kill<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
the more traffic you see to kill is the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640 
the more traffic you see to kill is the
better<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.329> could<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.600> keep<00:03:13.840> going<00:03:13.930> like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
better so you could just keep going like

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.979 
better so you could just keep going like
right<00:03:14.709> now<00:03:15.100> I'm<00:03:15.250> waiting<00:03:15.459> for<00:03:15.700> people<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.690> I'm

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.289 
patrolling this in a competitive
gameplay<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.320> would<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.739> rushing<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.730> crushing
