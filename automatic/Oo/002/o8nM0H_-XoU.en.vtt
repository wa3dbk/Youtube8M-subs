like<00:02:50.739> from<00:02:50.950> Coastal<00:02:51.370> Scents<00:02:52.349> but<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.620> think<00:02:53.799> it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
like from Coastal Scents but I think it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.270 
like from Coastal Scents but I think it
looks<00:02:53.950> better<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.959> looks<00:02:56.230> thicker<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.920> it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
looks better it looks thicker and it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.610 
looks better it looks thicker and it
also<00:02:57.400> stays<00:02:57.849> on<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.450> longer<00:02:58.480> once<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.349> dries
