tilt the afraid for some heat to the
sides<00:00:13.000> here's<00:00:14.000> a<00:00:14.089> side<00:00:14.480> bending<00:00:15.139> machine<00:00:16.040> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
sides here's a side bending machine and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.070 
sides here's a side bending machine and
no<00:00:19.020> saw<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> block<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.400> comes<00:00:21.060> down<00:00:21.450> to<00:00:21.840> bend

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
no saw the block this comes down to bend

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.280 
no saw the block this comes down to bend
the<00:00:22.230> sides<00:00:22.530> of<00:00:22.890> shape<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> same<00:00:23.640> size<00:00:24.290> traced

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
the sides of shape the same size traced

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.269 
the sides of shape the same size traced
it<00:00:25.620> off<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.080> we<00:00:28.080> buy<00:00:28.650> wood<00:00:28.920> sheets

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it off of it so we buy wood sheets

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.479 
it off of it so we buy wood sheets
together<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:31.320> gives<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.710> close-up<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
together and there gives a close-up of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.180 
together and there gives a close-up of
it<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.620> idea<00:00:35.129> of<00:00:35.190> how<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.640> works<00:00:37.190> by

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it and an idea of how it works by

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
it and an idea of how it works by
looking<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.420> well<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> should<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
looking at that really well I should be

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.510 
looking at that really well I should be
able<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> good<00:00:40.770> idea

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
able to get a good idea

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.110 
attaching the bungee cord type and units
that<00:00:52.190> will<00:00:52.460> hold<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:53.150> side<00:00:54.050> bending<00:00:54.560> units<00:00:55.250> in

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
that will hold the side bending units in

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.730 
that will hold the side bending units in
the<00:00:56.210> future<00:00:56.570> here's<00:00:57.380> your<00:00:57.680> book<00:00:58.250> match<00:00:58.580> sides

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
the future here's your book match sides

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.010 
the future here's your book match sides
out<00:01:00.740> that<00:01:01.730> means<00:01:02.090> it's<00:01:02.480> going<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.810> be<00:01:02.870> the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
out that means it's going to be the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.550 
out that means it's going to be the
outside<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.800> guitar

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
outside of the guitar

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.109 
outside of the guitar
arrow<00:01:06.189> down<00:01:06.549> means<00:01:07.000> such<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> flat<00:01:07.990> side

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
arrow down means such a flat side

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.980 
arrow down means such a flat side
now<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.479> wrap<00:01:10.689> them<00:01:10.960> up<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.409> aluminum<00:01:11.799> foil

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
now you wrap them up in aluminum foil

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.599 
now you wrap them up in aluminum foil
spray<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:14.590> little<00:01:14.859> bit<00:01:15.039> of<00:01:15.130> water<00:01:15.340> in

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
spray just a little bit of water in

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.490 
spray just a little bit of water in
there<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.969> don't<00:01:16.119> need<00:01:16.390> much<00:01:16.689> in<00:01:16.990> there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
there you don't need much in there

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.529 
there you don't need much in there
then<00:01:19.619> basically<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.890> want<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.250> put<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.549> piece

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
then basically you want to put a piece

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.749 
then basically you want to put a piece
of<00:01:22.569> tape<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:23.319> mark<00:01:23.560> where<00:01:23.920> you're<00:01:24.280> gonna<00:01:24.429> want

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
of tape to mark where you're gonna want

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.680 
of tape to mark where you're gonna want
it<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.119> be<00:01:25.329> on<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:25.960> side<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
it to be on the side so you

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.660 
it to be on the side so you
and<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.050> being<00:01:28.980> a<00:01:29.220> vegan<00:01:29.550> sides<00:01:30.120> okay

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
and it being a vegan sides okay

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.940 
and it being a vegan sides okay
there's<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.300> heat<00:01:32.540> blanket<00:01:33.200> been<00:01:33.890> put<00:01:34.190> on<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
there's the heat blanket been put on and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.740 
there's the heat blanket been put on and
I'm<00:01:36.950> give<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.490> an<00:01:37.580> idea<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:39.670> basically<00:01:40.750> this

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
I'm give you an idea and basically this

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.780 
I'm give you an idea and basically this
is<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.350> thermostat<00:01:43.070> with<00:01:43.790> your<00:01:44.090> timer<00:01:44.620> but<00:01:45.620> I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
is a thermostat with your timer but I

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.850 
is a thermostat with your timer but I
switch<00:01:46.790> there's<00:01:47.330> yellow<00:01:47.690> blocks<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.710> your

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
switch there's yellow blocks and your

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.920 
switch there's yellow blocks and your
bungee<00:01:49.070> cords<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.970> are<00:01:50.000> gonna<00:01:50.240> hold<00:01:50.600> that

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
bungee cords that are gonna hold that

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.800 
bungee cords that are gonna hold that
down<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.979> blocks<00:01:52.370> as<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.060> bend<00:01:53.540> your<00:01:53.690> sides

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
down the blocks as you bend your sides

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.600 
down the blocks as you bend your sides
basically<00:01:56.810> bungee<00:01:57.710> cord<00:01:58.010> in<00:01:58.220> place<00:02:00.430> see<00:02:01.430> how

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
basically bungee cord in place see how

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.560 
basically bungee cord in place see how
they<00:02:01.790> both<00:02:02.020> look

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
they both look

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.040 
they both look
turn<00:02:05.110> on<00:02:05.320> your<00:02:05.460> check<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.670> make<00:02:07.030> sure<00:02:07.060> mark<00:02:07.720> is

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
turn on your check and make sure mark is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.260 
turn on your check and make sure mark is
there<00:02:08.410> get<00:02:09.369> ready<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.910> turn<00:02:10.150> on<00:02:10.420> your<00:02:10.630> heat

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
there get ready to turn on your heat

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.070 
there get ready to turn on your heat
start<00:02:13.270> applying<00:02:13.630> heat<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> probably<00:02:15.430> count<00:02:16.080> 80

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
start applying heat to probably count 80

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.980 
start applying heat to probably count 80
seconds<00:02:17.860> there's<00:02:18.100> an<00:02:18.340> end<00:02:18.550> looking<00:02:19.150> picture

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
seconds there's an end looking picture

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.230 
seconds there's an end looking picture
and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.420 
and
then<00:02:21.480> licking<00:02:21.960> picture<00:02:22.470> will<00:02:22.650> show<00:02:22.680> somewhere

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
then licking picture will show somewhere

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.180 
then licking picture will show somewhere
in<00:02:23.580> between<00:02:23.730> stuff<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.500> gives<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.070> an

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
in between stuff but that gives you an

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.070 
in between stuff but that gives you an
idea<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.820> how<00:02:27.030> they're<00:02:27.270> gonna<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.630> stretched

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
idea of how they're gonna be stretched

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.470 
idea of how they're gonna be stretched
out

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
out

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.150 
out
now<00:02:29.720> here's<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.980> lesson<00:02:31.220> itself<00:02:33.160> basically

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
now here's the lesson itself basically

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.390 
now here's the lesson itself basically
it's<00:02:34.370> been<00:02:34.610> heated<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.360> two<00:02:35.930> times<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.800> 60

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it's been heated up for two times of 60

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.600 
it's been heated up for two times of 60
seconds<00:02:37.819> peace<00:02:38.950> checking<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> make<00:02:40.069> sure<00:02:40.250> the
