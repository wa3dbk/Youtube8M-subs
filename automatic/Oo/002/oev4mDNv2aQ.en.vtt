00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.630
 I like a lot of people exactly in this 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.540
 type of parties because the expense does not 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.980
 because they are 100 200 dollars 300 dollars and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.290
 it's a sacrifice finally but 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.890
 coming to the USA maybe they win better 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.610
