we're<00:00:15.719> really<00:00:15.839> kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> predicted<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> walk

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
we're really kind of predicted the walk

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.150 
we're really kind of predicted the walk
from<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.730> pink<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.480> above<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.160> they

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
from that pink or just above but they

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
from that pink or just above but they
don't<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.820> area<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> fight<00:00:21.930> him<00:00:22.109> they

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
don't have the area to fight him they

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.080 
don't have the area to fight him they
don't<00:00:22.410> own<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> space<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.279> yet<00:00:23.460> Santorin

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
don't own this space just yet Santorin

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
there they get the concussive blows to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
there they get the concussive blows to
lock<00:00:29.279> down<00:00:29.580> unfortunately<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.570> goes<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> bunny

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
lock down unfortunately it goes to bunny

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
lock down unfortunately it goes to bunny
foo-foo<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> kill<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> kill<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> that's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
foo-foo but a kill is a kill and that's

foo-foo but a kill is a kill and that's
the<00:00:32.759> second<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.450> gravity<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the second one here for gravity and it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
the second one here for gravity and it's
the<00:00:34.020> second<00:00:34.350> game<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> row<00:00:34.680> gsm<00:00:35.190> fails<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
on guys learn for what happens in this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
on guys learn for what happens in this
one<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.760> didn't<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> adequate<00:00:45.719> lane

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
one they didn't have the adequate lane

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
one they didn't have the adequate lane
pressure<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.559> order<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.430> are

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
pressure in order to make like they are

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
pressure in order to make like they are
completely<00:00:47.969> fine<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.600> gravity<00:00:49.230> taking<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
completely fine with gravity taking this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.400 
completely fine with gravity taking this
crap<00:00:49.980> yeah<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> vision

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
crap yeah they do not have the vision

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
crap yeah they do not have the vision
control<00:00:52.620> yet<00:00:53.550> again<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.750> pull<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.550> very

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
control yet again to pull this off very

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
control yet again to pull this off very
big<00:00:56.789> difference<00:00:56.910> based<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> early<00:00:58.320> game

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
big difference based on the early game

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.849 
big difference based on the early game
credibly<00:00:59.399> slow<00:01:00.020> move<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:01.649> they're

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
credibly slow move there but now they're

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
credibly slow move there but now they're
going<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> fight<00:01:02.550> their<00:01:02.760> only<00:01:03.090> win

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
going for a fight their only win

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
going for a fight their only win
condition<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.650> an

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
condition here this is going to be an

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.469 
condition here this is going to be an
area<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.460> shock<00:01:05.729> wave<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.330> down

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
area for shock wave actually it's down

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
area for shock wave actually it's down
for<00:01:06.720> P<00:01:06.840> Erickson<00:01:07.200> let's<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
for P Erickson let's see if they get a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.080 
for P Erickson let's see if they get a
good<00:01:07.950> hit<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.100> glacial<00:01:08.400> fissure<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
good hit and glacial fissure kind of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
good hit and glacial fissure kind of
separates<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.470> over

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
separates it a bit but they are all over

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.920 
separates it a bit but they are all over
the<00:01:11.130> members<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> gravity<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.479> dyrus

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the members of gravity that's dyrus

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.499 
the members of gravity that's dyrus
getting<00:01:13.250> pushed<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> fight<00:01:14.909> haunters

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
getting pushed out of the fight haunters

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
getting pushed out of the fight haunters
now<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> backside<00:01:16.229> turtle<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> bit<00:01:17.009> appeal

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
now the backside turtle has a bit appeal

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
now the backside turtle has a bit appeal
for<00:01:17.400> himself<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:18.000> nice<00:01:18.509> follow<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
for himself a nice follow with the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
for himself a nice follow with the
repeal<00:01:19.530> coming<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> flash<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:20.909> TSN

repeal coming in and flash from TSN

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.760 
repeal coming in and flash from TSN
would<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> face<00:01:22.110> check<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.619> they

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
would have to face check in but they

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
would have to face check in but they
don't<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> fall<00:01:23.640> too<00:01:23.790> far<00:01:23.970> behind<00:01:24.030> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
don't want to fall too far behind this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
don't want to fall too far behind this
is<00:01:24.930> interesting<00:01:25.259> no<00:01:25.409> waves<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.860> pushed<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
is interesting no waves are pushed so

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
is interesting no waves are pushed so
