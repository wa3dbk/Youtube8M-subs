00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello I will explain 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.609
 quickly in this video how 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.740
 transform a micro-sim so that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.830
 looks like that or a classic sim if 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.830
 you still have a sim version version 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.049
 normal what big how 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 so transform your sim into a ring 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 cement does so you can ask 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.960
 one to your operator but get started 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 as much to you bring him or if you too 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.609
 you made it pay or if you want 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.650
 really not wait you can 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.399
 to transform without problem into a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 micro sim in anonymous 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 so that's enough to actually cut 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 with a chisel the peaks are in very 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.260
 fine and it's small step plastic 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 very good quality so a chisel that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 cut well enough just cut 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.000
 actually exactly along the metal here 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.129
 so really you cut it by following the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.430
 metal leave you in less than one 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.039
 millimeter in half millimeter 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 plastic all around really it the same 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.799
 the corners so it's important to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.020
 really do it all along like that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.689
 beyond the chip in itself of the chip 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 metal you really cut Toulon 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.869
 here and you can finish by scraping 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.930
 in fact with the with the chisel in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.920
 rubbing like this to make it good 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.610
 well-being and in principle it's okay 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.259
 give something that looks like that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.090
 so at this sim which was so a 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 micro sim to bad and that I cut 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.850
 we see here it's not it's not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.920
 exactly it's not great in quarters and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.189
 I do them quickly to fill this has 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 worked and this is the case here after 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 so there as we see it remains 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 really more than the chip so here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.040
 you really have little chance 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 to damage your sim because in fact it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.909
 you really have to go along the line 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.170
 you do not have to put scissors 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.670
 sure 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.290
 lasimant of herself even if they 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 obviously it will work more but 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.380
 if you really follow and you are 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.970
 cut out all the plastic but not the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.740
 metal chip 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.179
 you have no chance to animate your 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.800
 team since it's just plastic 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.250
 actually serves nothing it's just a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 support that's after once you 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.540
 have cut your sim yourself to you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.150
 know maybe she's that nano 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.120
 sim is supposed to be less thick than the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 micro sim normal there are ten 15% 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.720
 of two less thick so 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.880
 normally you have to think of this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.790
 side there with sandpaper it takes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 push for it to be barely less 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 thick but actually if you try to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 directly put your sim of this 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 way that's in a young and the good 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 meaning so it really has to be she 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.350
 not actually exceed the beginning where you 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.049
 maybe go there m kind of like that where 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.630
 dad not perfectly it really takes 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.549
 that it is really necessary that the asim 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.880
 do not go over it really has to 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.650
 be well engaged in the in the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 small drawer if it clicks wrong 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.840
 it's that you've actually cut off 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.760
 around around the metal chip 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.160
 in this case you must iron a small 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 pair of scissors and you can like 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.040
 as the publisher does with the with your 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.340
 scissors scraped like that for a little 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.810
 think in the end so that it is well 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.220
 well right and so that it goes into the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 in the little drawer and once that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.690
 come in well you just have to insert 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.890
 so like that 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.130
 as you see there is not really 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.290
 need to force and so the vo thi may 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.970
 in the iphone there we see that it detects 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.069
 not in fact simply because it 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.720
 there is a one in two chance of being wrong 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.519
 of meaning so if you ever fool yourself 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.230
 sense clothing nothing level of 6000 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.410
 iphone it's just that he does not detect 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.750
 so in this case you take it out so 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.970
 as we see no need to sand or 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.079
 other she's supposed to be a little bit more 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.269
 thick but as we see there I 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.250
 force not and it comes back to 1.40 and that 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.170
 leave worry free so here is if you 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.980
 deceive you need just the inverted 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.640
 like that hop 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.620
 in fact normally the nano if any of 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.010
 deceptive as the classic signs in 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.690
 does so she just has a I 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.600
 do not know where I am here she has a 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.130
 little a little corner like that they who 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.930
 not to be wrong in fact of the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.660
 put in the right way but we like 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.520
 it was cut in a rectangular way 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.460
 does not hit those misleading 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.630
 so just test one way and 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.639
 if it's not that one it's necessarily 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.860
 the other meaning so here is normally 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.690
 i will insert it and iphone see 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.690
 automatically detected the asim 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:52.280
 here is the young heroine and hop 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.320
 my micro sim that was then so a 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.430
 micro sim has become an email address 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.389
 works directly on the on my 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.610
 iphone 5 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:09.590
 so here is again really the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:15.610
 steps are are clear to go from 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.810
 that to that it is really enough to cut out 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.450
 all around to take a little bit off the whole 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.240
 plastic including well in the east in 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.380
 the corners do not need corners 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.200
 rectangular forum that is rounded 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.110
 continue the rounding beyond the chip 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.820
 metallic here so here is enough 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.979
 to cut it like that no need to 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.300
 think as we see here the noise that 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.770
 is still registered I do not have any 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.310
 all thought they are doing exactly the same 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.970
 thickness 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.919
 it is therefore enough to cut well 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.539
 edge of well there that she is in the 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.820
 drawer and then to try in the 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.410
 two senses like that if it does not work 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.200
 is that it's the other way 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.440
 this is so these men in singles so 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.900
 the holy connector the contact of the 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.630
 so cie the chip and down towards the 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.370
 back of the iphone do not try the tour 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.940
 to the screen his ranks like that he 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.060
 must put it 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.800
 and suddenly it will work without 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.900
 worry you have almost no risk 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.280
 to ruin votive reassures if you ever 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.460
 the damaged I will not be really 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.420
 responsible for the damage will be more 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.130
 that mayy may 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.360
 I think there is really little chance 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.250
 unless you really have a shot 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.080
 scissors across the sim but in 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.160
 principle if you know how to use decides 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.160
 where it's unlikely to happen
