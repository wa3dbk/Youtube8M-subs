down into the condenser we run cold
water<00:00:50.809> through<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:52.010> chills<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.789> the

also<00:00:56.420> oil<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:57.829> right<00:00:58.160> here<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.489> called<00:00:58.640> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
also oil and this right here is called a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.450 
also oil and this right here is called a
separator<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.170> separators<00:01:00.710> job<00:01:01.010> is<00:01:01.280> to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
separator and the separators job is to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.100 
separator and the separators job is to
separate<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> water<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.480> oil<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.079> that

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
separate the water in the oil so that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
separate the water in the oil so that
oil<00:01:03.469> comes<00:01:03.859> off<00:01:04.070> on<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.729> top<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.680> water

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
oil comes off on the top and the water

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.040 
oil comes off on the top and the water
is<00:01:07.250> also<00:01:07.520> something<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.330> use<00:01:08.539> it's<00:01:08.780> used
