interesting<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> front<00:01:24.299> facing<00:01:24.600> camera

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
interesting that the front facing camera

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.270 
interesting that the front facing camera
is<00:01:25.020> such<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> high<00:01:25.500> resolution<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is such a high resolution for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
is such a high resolution for
front-facing<00:01:26.700> cameras<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.020> very

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
front-facing cameras I think it's very

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
front-facing cameras I think it's very
it's<00:01:28.500> becoming<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:28.829> popular<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.759> on

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it's becoming very popular you see it on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's becoming very popular you see it on

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
facebook and people use myspace I maybe

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.410 
facebook and people use myspace I maybe
I<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.710> whatever<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> hold

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
I don't know but whatever it is to hold

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
I don't know but whatever it is to hold
their<00:01:36.570> phone<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
their phone up like this and kind of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
their phone up like this and kind of
take<00:01:38.549> self<00:01:39.180> pictures<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.350> pictures

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
take self pictures or to take pictures

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.069 
take self pictures or to take pictures
with<00:01:41.340> their<00:01:41.549> friends<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.390> because

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
with their friends like this because

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.980 
with their friends like this because
it's<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> lot<00:01:43.470> easier<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it's a lot easier and I think that the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's a lot easier and I think that the
fact<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.290> they're<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> increasing<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
fact that they're kind of increasing the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639 
fact that they're kind of increasing the
resolution<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.810> front-facing<00:01:49.200> cameras

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
resolution on these front-facing cameras

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
resolution on these front-facing cameras
really<00:01:49.950> helps<00:01:50.549> make<00:01:50.790> those<00:01:51.030> types<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
really helps make those types of

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870 
really helps make those types of
pictures<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.140> better<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> video

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
pictures a lot better I think that video

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.260 
pictures a lot better I think that video
chat<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.979> video<00:01:56.759> chat<00:01:57.000> over

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
chat is one thing but video chat over

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.639 
chat is one thing but video chat over

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
a very interesting phone it does kind of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.730 
a very interesting phone it does kind of
resemble<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.370> Lumia<00:02:40.700> line<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.570> 920<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.440> even

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
resemble the Lumia line the 920 and even

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.270 
resemble the Lumia line the 920 and even
being<00:02:43.520> only<00:02:43.700> 900<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.610> know<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.730> think<00:02:46.940> that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
being only 900 but you know I think that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.040 
being only 900 but you know I think that
what<00:02:49.280> HTC<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:49.970> doing<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.420> they're<00:02:50.570> taking<00:02:50.960> a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
what HTC is doing is they're taking a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.440 
what HTC is doing is they're taking a
lot<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> things<00:02:51.530> they<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.830> best

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
lot of the things they do best

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.520 
lot of the things they do best
craftsmanship<00:02:54.430> beats<00:02:55.430> audio<00:02:55.810> etc<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
craftsmanship beats audio etc and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.890 
craftsmanship beats audio etc and
they're<00:02:58.010> putting<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.580> into<00:02:58.820> Windows<00:02:59.420> Phone<00:02:59.660> 8

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
they're putting it into Windows Phone 8

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.050 
they're putting it into Windows Phone 8
because<00:03:00.440> right<00:03:01.220> now<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.670> they're<00:03:01.820> they're

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
because right now that they're they're

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.030 
because right now that they're they're
very<00:03:02.240> much<00:03:02.450> an<00:03:02.570> Android<00:03:03.050> only<00:03:03.410> platform<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
very much an Android only platform and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.130 
very much an Android only platform and
they<00:03:04.100> really<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.520> need<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.790> diversify<00:03:05.150> now<00:03:05.990> I'm

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
they really do need to diversify now I'm

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.720 
they really do need to diversify now I'm
not<00:03:06.320> gonna<00:03:06.620> sit<00:03:06.890> here<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.070> speculate<00:03:07.700> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
not gonna sit here and speculate that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910 
not gonna sit here and speculate that
Android<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.840> into<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.560> going<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:09.770> be

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
Android is going into is going to be

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.440 
Android is going into is going to be
having<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> lot<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.490> struggles<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> future

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
having a lot of struggles in the future

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.520 
having a lot of struggles in the future
I<00:03:11.480> think<00:03:11.540> android<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> very<00:03:12.350> mature

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
I think android is a very mature

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.140 
I think android is a very mature
operating<00:03:13.130> system<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.640> better<00:03:13.790> than<00:03:14.000> it's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
operating system and is better than it's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330 
operating system and is better than it's
ever<00:03:14.300> been<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.380> think<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.680> very<00:03:15.740> smart

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
ever been but I think it's very smart

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.640 
ever been but I think it's very smart
for<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.820> carrot<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.390> partner<00:03:17.750> such<00:03:18.050> as<00:03:18.170> HTC

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
for a carrot for a partner such as HTC

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.440 
for a carrot for a partner such as HTC
especially<00:03:19.310> when<00:03:19.400> they're<00:03:19.520> having<00:03:19.670> revenue

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
especially when they're having revenue

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.380 
especially when they're having revenue
issues<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:22.040> start<00:03:22.340> diversifying<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:23.209> to

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
issues to start diversifying and to

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.910 
issues to start diversifying and to
launch<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.750> Windows<00:03:24.020> Phone<00:03:24.230> especially

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
launch in Windows Phone especially

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.440 
launch in Windows Phone especially
