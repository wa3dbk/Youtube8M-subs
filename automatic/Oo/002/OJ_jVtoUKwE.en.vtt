00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
when installed in the vehicle I use the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.870 
when installed in the vehicle I use the
positions<00:01:52.009> recommended<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.789> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880

out<00:01:54.709> great<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.700> more<00:01:55.850> candid<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.329> cases<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
out great the more candid the cases the

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
lower the drive shaft angle I would get

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.029 
lower the drive shaft angle I would get
the<00:01:59.329> studs<00:01:59.600> close<00:01:59.929> with<00:02:00.170> an<00:02:00.289> impact<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:00.920> then
