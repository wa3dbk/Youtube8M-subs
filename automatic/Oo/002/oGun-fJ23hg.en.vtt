00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on after the temperature drops to 40

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
on after the temperature drops to 40
degree<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> cooling<00:00:53.789> device<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.390> part

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
degree the cooling device will be part

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.639 
degree the cooling device will be part
of<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.750> heat<00:00:57.930> device<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.620> be

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
of and then the heat device will be

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.640 
of and then the heat device will be
poured<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.329> when<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> temperature<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.260> below<00:01:02.359> 35

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
poured on when a temperature is below 35

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.170 
poured on when a temperature is below 35
I'll<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.920> water<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> control<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I'll use water to control the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.109 
I'll use water to control the
temperature<00:01:06.540> pay<00:01:07.290> attention<00:01:10.880> pour<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:14.119> now

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
temperature pay attention pour down now

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.499 
temperature pay attention pour down now
I<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> sensor<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.799> water

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:35.819 

this<00:01:22.509> will<00:01:22.750> be<00:01:22.900> powered<00:01:23.259> off<00:01:23.380> at<00:01:23.650> 40<00:01:24.189> degree

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:52.330 

the<00:01:36.310> temperature<00:01:36.939> goes<00:01:37.210> up<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:38.820> 45

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.530 

cooling<00:01:53.340> device<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:53.940> being<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.479> long

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.410 

now<00:01:59.110> again<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.770> put<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.250> sensor<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.030> pour

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
now again I put the sensor in to pour

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.410 
now again I put the sensor in to pour
water

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:17.190
