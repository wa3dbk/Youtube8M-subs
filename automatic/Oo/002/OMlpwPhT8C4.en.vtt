okay<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.890> lesson<00:00:08.429> number<00:00:08.580> four<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.240> Chinese

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
okay so lesson number four in Chinese

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.730 
okay so lesson number four in Chinese
numbers<00:00:10.670> we<00:00:11.670> learned<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> count<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.740> 9999

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
numbers we learned how to count to 9999

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
numbers we learned how to count to 9999
last<00:00:14.519> time<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.969> we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> count<00:00:15.690> beyond

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
last time so we're going to count beyond

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.150 
last time so we're going to count beyond
that<00:00:16.500> today<00:00:18.140> first<00:00:19.140> thing<00:00:19.410> after<00:00:19.590> clarify

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that today first thing after clarify

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
that today first thing after clarify
here<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:21.560> Chinese<00:00:22.560> numbers<00:00:24.019> are<00:00:25.019> grouped

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
here is that Chinese numbers are grouped

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
here is that Chinese numbers are grouped
the<00:00:26.070> digits<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> Chinese<00:00:26.910> numbers<00:00:27.240> are

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the digits and Chinese numbers are

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.339 
the digits and Chinese numbers are
grouped<00:00:27.750> into<00:00:27.960> four<00:00:29.390> not<00:00:30.390> three<00:00:30.660> AZ<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
grouped into four not three AZ in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.310 
grouped into four not three AZ in
english<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.420> english<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.930> count<00:00:34.170> up

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
english so like in english we count up

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.250 
english so like in english we count up
to<00:00:35.450> thousands<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.719> after<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> go

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to thousands in there after that we go

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
to thousands in there after that we go
ten<00:00:37.440> thousand<00:00:37.800> hundred<00:00:38.070> thousand<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> then

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
ten thousand hundred thousand and then

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.260 
ten thousand hundred thousand and then
we<00:00:38.969> go<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> millions<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.910> Chinese<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.120> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
we go to millions in Chinese we have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
we go to millions in Chinese we have
like<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> single<00:00:42.840> word<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.050> ten<00:00:43.410> thousand<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
like a single word for ten thousand and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
like a single word for ten thousand and
then<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.270> ten<00:00:45.719> ten<00:00:46.020> thousand<00:00:46.500> one

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then we go to ten ten thousand one

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
then we go to ten ten thousand one
hundred<00:00:46.829> ten<00:00:47.219> thousand<00:00:47.700> thousand<00:00:48.210> ten

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
hundred ten thousand thousand ten

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.610 
hundred ten thousand thousand ten
thousand<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.050> another<00:00:49.079> word

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
thousand and then we have another word

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
thousand and then we have another word
for<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:51.320> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> next<00:00:52.739> number<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for a for the next number so that is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.970 
for a for the next number so that is
sort<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> confusing<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.480> let's<00:00:59.210> let's<00:01:00.210> just

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
sort of confusing so let's let's just

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.899 
sort of confusing so let's let's just
start<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> beginning<00:01:04.280> okay<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
start from the beginning okay so the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
start from the beginning okay so the
word<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.420> word<00:01:06.510> ten<00:01:07.110> thousand<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:10.159> one<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
word for word ten thousand is one and it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.810 
word for word ten thousand is one and it
looks<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.820> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
looks like that so you can see it that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.539 
looks like that so you can see it that's
why<00:01:21.500> okay<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.380> 10,000<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> not

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
why okay and so it's 10,000 is not

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.649 
why okay and so it's 10,000 is not
shruti<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.829> we<00:01:28.829> don't<00:01:28.950> say<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.659> okay

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
shruti and we don't say it that way okay

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.020 
shruti and we don't say it that way okay
so<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:31.439> ten<00:01:31.619> thousand<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.310> UN<00:01:34.850> notice<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so one ten thousand is UN notice that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
so one ten thousand is UN notice that
the<00:01:36.180> e<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.780> becomes<00:01:37.500> second<00:01:37.860> tone<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> front<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the e is becomes second tone in front of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
the e is becomes second tone in front of
one<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.329> want<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.240> went<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.720> with

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
one so as you want so you went one with

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
one so as you want so you went one with
four<00:01:43.470> zeros<00:01:44.130> behind<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
four zeros behind it then we go up to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.300 
four zeros behind it then we go up to
sure<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:50.180> which<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.350> one<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.680> five<00:01:52.979> zeros

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
sure one which is one with five zeros

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.149 
sure one which is one with five zeros
behind<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.479> by<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:57.200> then<00:01:58.820> gym<00:01:59.820> when

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.450 

let's<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.549> comparison<00:02:05.240> here<00:02:06.189> Tim<00:02:07.189> when

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
let's have a comparison here Tim when

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:22.640 
let's have a comparison here Tim when
looks<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:14.150> awesome<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.510> Tim<00:02:17.510> one

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.580 

okay<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.379> then<00:02:25.379> after<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:30.590> another

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
okay so then after that we have another

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:42.160 
okay so then after that we have another
word<00:02:32.129> which<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.849> e<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.900> looks<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.549> this

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
word which is e and it looks like this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:53.280 
word which is e and it looks like this
and<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.400> add<00:02:44.579> another<00:02:44.909> zero

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.930 

right<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.159> one<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:56.650> eight<00:02:57.650> zeros<00:02:58.459> behind<00:02:58.670> it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
right so one with eight zeros behind it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.820 
right so one with eight zeros behind it
that's<00:02:59.209> e<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> we<00:03:02.510> go<00:03:02.659> on<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.930> schooi<00:03:03.260> by<00:03:03.799> e

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
that's e and so we go on to schooi by e

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.610 
that's e and so we go on to schooi by e
to<00:03:04.280> e<00:03:04.430> then<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.180> jaw<00:03:05.569> which<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.049> equivalent<00:03:06.349> of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
to e then to jaw which is equivalent of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.350 
to e then to jaw which is equivalent of
a<00:03:06.709> trillion<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:07.280> we<00:03:07.489> won't<00:03:07.640> go<00:03:07.819> farther<00:03:08.120> than

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
a trillion so we won't go farther than

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.369 
a trillion so we won't go farther than
that<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.459> let's<00:03:10.459> get<00:03:11.150> some<00:03:11.360> examples<00:03:11.840> so

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
that so let's get some examples so

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:21.130 
that so let's get some examples so
what's<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.920> number<00:03:13.220> like<00:03:16.360> 983<00:03:18.250> billion<00:03:20.140> 459

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
what's a number like 983 billion 459

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.069 
what's a number like 983 billion 459
million<00:03:21.790> seven<00:03:22.790> hundred<00:03:22.840> ninety<00:03:23.840> three

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
million seven hundred ninety three

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.569 
million seven hundred ninety three
thousand<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.810> 847<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:27.849> chinese<00:03:30.310> well<00:03:31.310> so

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
thousand and 847 in chinese well so

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.849 
thousand and 847 in chinese well so
let's<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.629> first<00:03:32.660> step<00:03:33.049> in<00:03:33.200> translating<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
let's the first step in translating the

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.920 
let's the first step in translating the
number<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.609> group<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.090> digits<00:03:35.450> into<00:03:35.599> four

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
number is to group the digits into four

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.509 
number is to group the digits into four
so<00:03:36.909> once<00:03:37.909> you<00:03:38.030> remove<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.420> commas<00:03:38.870> here<00:03:39.519> and

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
so once you remove the commas here and

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.470 
so once you remove the commas here and
then<00:03:41.120> put<00:03:41.450> spaces<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.400> looks<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.700> this

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
then put spaces so it looks like this

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.479 
then put spaces so it looks like this
now<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:51.440> let's<00:03:51.620> start<00:03:51.859> from<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.069> first<00:03:52.220> group

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
now so let's start from the first group

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.460 
now so let's start from the first group
so<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.450> um<00:03:54.700> Joe<00:03:55.700> Tim<00:03:56.000> Bobby<00:03:56.660> Sanchez<00:03:57.049> suit

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
so we have um Joe Tim Bobby Sanchez suit

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:07.740 
so we have um Joe Tim Bobby Sanchez suit
e<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.470> 9800<00:04:01.430> 34e<00:04:02.359> and<00:04:03.069> then<00:04:04.069> you<00:04:04.250> have<00:04:06.099> 5979

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
e so 9800 34e and then you have 5979

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.080 
e so 9800 34e and then you have 5979
thousand<00:04:08.750> ten<00:04:09.379> thousand<00:04:09.859> so<00:04:09.980> which<00:04:10.280> in<00:04:10.519> 20<00:04:10.849> by

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
thousand ten thousand so which in 20 by

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.920 
thousand ten thousand so which in 20 by
T<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.750> do<00:04:11.959> one<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.859> then<00:04:13.120> send<00:04:14.120> him<00:04:14.329> Bob<00:04:14.720> i

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
T to do one and then send him Bob i

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.719 
T to do one and then send him Bob i
Suchi<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:17.150> then<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.840> fluid<00:04:21.280> saying<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.460> fluid

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
Suchi so then the fluid saying it fluid

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.960 
Suchi so then the fluid saying it fluid
leads<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.570> Jim<00:04:23.960> Bob<00:04:24.199> I<00:04:24.380> signs<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:25.010> one<00:04:25.639> up

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
leads so Jim Bob I signs just one up

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.330 
leads so Jim Bob I signs just one up

by 2201 centium bar by susie cheat so

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.529 
by 2201 centium bar by susie cheat so
that's<00:04:37.000> 9800<00:04:38.000> 34<00:04:38.479> million<00:04:41.500> 9983<00:04:42.580> billion<00:04:43.580> 459

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
that's 9800 34 million 9983 billion 459

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:54.939 
that's 9800 34 million 9983 billion 459
million<00:04:44.870> 790<00:04:46.720> 3847<00:04:47.979> so<00:04:53.020> it's<00:04:54.020> pretty

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
million 790 3847 so it's pretty

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.250 
million 790 3847 so it's pretty
difficult<00:04:55.280> concept<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.000> foreigners<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.539> get

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
difficult concept for foreigners to get

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.990 
difficult concept for foreigners to get
accustomed<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:58.310> three<00:04:59.300> did<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:01.520> four

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
accustomed to the three did the four

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 
accustomed to the three did the four
digit<00:05:02.180> grouping<00:05:02.719> if<00:05:02.900> you're<00:05:03.469> used<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.800> three

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
digit grouping if you're used to three

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.600 
digit grouping if you're used to three
digit<00:05:04.280> group

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
digit group

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.790 
digit group
so<00:05:05.479> most<00:05:06.050> of<00:05:06.139> time<00:05:06.289> you'll<00:05:06.439> probably<00:05:06.590> be

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
so most of time you'll probably be

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.709 
so most of time you'll probably be
relying<00:05:07.159> on<00:05:07.340> writing<00:05:07.729> out<00:05:07.909> the<00:05:07.939> numbers<00:05:08.449> and

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
relying on writing out the numbers and

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.270 
relying on writing out the numbers and
Arabic<00:05:09.080> numerals<00:05:09.439> but<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.860> useful<00:05:10.039> skill

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
Arabic numerals but it's a useful skill

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:31.180 
Arabic numerals but it's a useful skill
so<00:05:11.090> let's<00:05:11.509> practice<00:05:11.930> some<00:05:11.960> more<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:22.280> one

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:39.390 

right<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.720> one<00:05:33.020> trillion<00:05:34.360> 230<00:05:36.160> billion<00:05:37.720> 215

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
right so one trillion 230 billion 215

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.040 
right so one trillion 230 billion 215
million<00:05:40.400> four<00:05:41.000> hundred<00:05:41.030> eighty<00:05:42.400> 7540<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.660> that

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
million four hundred eighty 7540 so that

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.420 
million four hundred eighty 7540 so that
as<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:46.040> said<00:05:46.070> earlier<00:05:46.960> beyond<00:05:47.960> e<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.800> have<00:05:49.010> JA

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
as I said earlier beyond e you have JA

00:05:49.430 --> 00:06:01.610 
as I said earlier beyond e you have JA
so<00:05:50.350> first<00:05:51.730> since<00:05:52.730> this<00:05:52.910> is<00:05:53.090> really<00:05:53.960> big<00:05:54.320> number

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.340 

oops

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.900 

so<00:06:05.350> you<00:06:05.440> have<00:06:05.710> four<00:06:06.160> groups<00:06:06.340> here<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.790> the

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
so you have four groups here so the

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.190 
so you have four groups here so the
first<00:06:07.180> one<00:06:07.360> will<00:06:07.540> be<00:06:07.570> chopped<00:06:07.960> so<00:06:08.320> each<00:06:08.950> out

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
first one will be chopped so each out

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:19.470 
first one will be chopped so each out
down<00:06:11.200> 10<00:06:11.590> senpai<00:06:12.690> linger<00:06:13.690> e<00:06:16.860> each<00:06:17.860> my<00:06:18.790> sister

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
down 10 senpai linger e each my sister

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.740 
down 10 senpai linger e each my sister

7540 so if you want to see the

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.190 
7540 so if you want to see the
characters<00:06:38.560> it<00:06:38.800> looks<00:06:39.010> like<00:06:39.220> this<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:43.200> pretty

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
characters it looks like this a pretty

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.260 
characters it looks like this a pretty
pretty<00:06:44.920> long<00:06:45.280> string<00:06:45.850> of<00:06:46.000> numbers<00:06:47.430> ok<00:06:48.430> so

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
pretty long string of numbers ok so

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.390 
pretty long string of numbers ok so
won't<00:06:49.750> go<00:06:49.930> to<00:06:49.990> force<00:06:50.830> you<00:06:50.980> through<00:06:51.190> any<00:06:51.280> of

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
this brain torture anymore so next time

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.800 
this brain torture anymore so next time
we'll<00:06:54.340> be<00:06:54.370> back<00:06:54.610> into<00:06:54.880> smaller<00:06:55.180> numbers<00:06:55.570> and

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
we'll be back into smaller numbers and

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.130 
we'll be back into smaller numbers and
out<00:06:56.310> so<00:06:57.310> where<00:06:57.910> we<00:06:58.060> learn<00:06:58.270> how<00:06:58.480> to<00:06:58.540> contract

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
out so where we learn how to contract

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.870 
out so where we learn how to contract
our<00:06:59.410> numbers<00:06:59.710> to<00:07:00.430> make<00:07:00.550> counting<00:07:01.120> faster

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880
