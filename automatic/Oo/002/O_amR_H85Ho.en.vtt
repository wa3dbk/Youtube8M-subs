now<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:04.920> we<00:00:05.009> know<00:00:05.040> what<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.310> gate<00:00:05.549> does<00:00:05.819> and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
now that we know what a gate does and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.210 
now that we know what a gate does and
understand<00:00:06.629> its<00:00:06.779> controls<00:00:07.230> let's<00:00:07.740> jump<00:00:08.069> into

dramatic<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.350> good<00:01:20.619> example<00:01:20.650> of

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
dramatic this is a good example of

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.730 
dramatic this is a good example of
