00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.800
 hello I am then one of the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.019
 organizers of the Latin American event 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.260
 of a festival that is that I know that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 is very very hard and that brings 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 very enthusiastic people that during 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.600
 many days are painting this the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.550
 city â€‹â€‹walls 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.079
 we were organizing the festival on 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 Latin American because they wanted to do 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.620
 let's move the area a bit 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.630
 to integrate graffiti into the area that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.030
 surrounds the train 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.170
 the community is there and everyone is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.580
 seeing that it is a difficult area 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.080
 but good with what you can contribute 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.060
 what is like a little paint are given 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.370
 all spaces that are on the street 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.890
 to be able to share the travelers on 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.490
 all in the neighborhoods that are more in the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.490
 periphery 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 of the system 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.050
 and I'm glad we 're collaborating here 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.870
 with the neighborhood board of micaela bastides 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.450
 for this to be a much more site 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.750
 pretty I think that somehow we're 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.620
 making history in giving some 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.910
 facilities so that in the art of 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.870
 street folk art urban art 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.830
 have a more orderly place 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.200
 a train a meter 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.640
 but symbolically represents a lot 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.920
 for people they mix all the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.920
 realities of people is great 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.120
 I believe that in coordination with the metro 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.640
 let's go towards a good point walking 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.590
 together during these years we can not 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.690
 continue working and achieve benefits 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.220
 for the community for the people who are 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.550
 around and for the same people that is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.550
