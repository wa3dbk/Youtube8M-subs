00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
actually the hammock didn't fail

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.940 
actually the hammock didn't fail
but<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.530> limb<00:00:15.769> I<00:00:16.039> had<00:00:16.340> tied<00:00:16.610> off<00:00:16.820> to<00:00:16.850> did<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:18.410> I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.210 
but the limb I had tied off to did and I
woke<00:00:19.220> up<00:00:19.430> very<00:00:20.230> suddenly<00:00:21.230> on<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.619> ground

I'll<00:00:22.880> admit<00:00:23.119> that<00:00:23.300> that<00:00:23.570> was<00:00:23.630> slightly

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
I'll admit that that was slightly

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
I'll admit that that was slightly
disturbing

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 

here's<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.810> problem<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.320> collecting<00:00:58.860> do

oftentimes in this air hado is this
water<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.260> dark

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
possible you have to start well before

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.490 
possible you have to start well before
dawn<00:01:27.819> though<00:01:28.060> because<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.509> burns<00:01:28.719> off<00:01:29.020> as<00:01:29.319> soon

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
dawn though because it burns off as soon

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
dawn though because it burns off as soon
as<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.649> Sun<00:01:29.859> comes<00:01:30.039> up<00:01:30.280> it'll<00:01:30.429> be<00:01:30.520> dried<00:01:30.789> off

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
as the Sun comes up it'll be dried off

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.719 
as the Sun comes up it'll be dried off
but<00:01:31.869> your<00:01:32.020> result<00:01:32.439> is<00:01:32.649> often<00:01:32.890> something<00:01:33.399> which

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
but your result is often something which

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.690 
but your result is often something which
it<00:01:34.709> looks<00:01:35.709> like<00:01:35.950> something<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.340> came<00:01:36.429> out<00:01:36.579> of

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it looks like something that came out of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.609 
it looks like something that came out of
the<00:01:36.789> worst<00:01:36.939> mud<00:01:37.240> puddle<00:01:37.599> you<00:01:37.750> ever<00:01:37.869> thought

somehow and obviously filtering it
through<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.739> bandana<00:01:51.250> isn't<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.209> to<00:01:52.270> work

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
through a bandana isn't going to work

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.819 
through a bandana isn't going to work
too<00:01:52.840> well<00:01:53.020> because<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:55.119> just<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:56.469> bushes

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
too well because it's just the bushes

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.260 
too well because it's just the bushes
and<00:01:56.979> everything<00:01:57.280> are<00:01:57.399> out<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.879> is<00:01:57.969> covered

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
and everything are out here is covered

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.380 
and everything are out here is covered
in<00:01:58.360> fine<00:01:58.599> dust<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.579> dude<00:02:00.789> just<00:02:00.819> pretty

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
in fine dust so the dude just pretty

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.569 
in fine dust so the dude just pretty
much<00:02:01.539> forms<00:02:01.899> mud<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.739> start<00:02:03.069> soaking<00:02:03.310> it

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
much forms mud when you start soaking it

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.770 
much forms mud when you start soaking it
up<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.000> if<00:02:04.869> you're<00:02:05.109> running<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:06.479> rag<00:02:07.479> through

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
up and if you're running a rag through

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.029 
up and if you're running a rag through
the<00:02:07.899> grass<00:02:08.140> you're<00:02:08.410> going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> collect<00:02:08.739> all

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the grass you're going to collect all

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.460 
the grass you're going to collect all
the<00:02:09.149> different<00:02:10.149> microbes<00:02:10.629> and<00:02:10.899> whatever<00:02:11.170> is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
the different microbes and whatever is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.140 
the different microbes and whatever is
on<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.859> grass<00:02:12.129> it's<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:12.579> to<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.000> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
on that grass it's going to be in that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.330 
on that grass it's going to be in that
water<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.530> definitely<00:02:14.950> something<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
water so it's definitely something you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.620 
water so it's definitely something you
have<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.670> treat<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> survival

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
have to treat and but it is a survival

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.979 
have to treat and but it is a survival
resource<00:02:20.049> if<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.910> reduced<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
resource if you are reduced to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.530 
resource if you are reduced to
collecting<00:02:23.500> Dew<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.849> will<00:02:25.060> give<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.389> that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
collecting Dew it will give you that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.250 
collecting Dew it will give you that
good<00:02:25.750> leader<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.549> morning<00:02:27.970> before<00:02:28.930> the

said<00:03:24.110> earlier<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.069> filter<00:03:25.579> this

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
here in the dry season so it's one of

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.409 
here in the dry season so it's one of
those<00:04:49.950> things<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.490> think<00:04:50.520> about<00:04:50.970> as<00:04:51.210> you

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
those things you think about as you

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.200 
those things you think about as you
change<00:04:51.690> your<00:04:51.930> kit<00:04:52.110> seasonally<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:53.160> go<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.120> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
change your kit seasonally to go to the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.210 
change your kit seasonally to go to the
different<00:04:54.330> areas<00:04:54.840> that's<00:04:55.200> one<00:04:55.440> thing<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.770> do<00:04:55.830> is

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
different areas that's one thing I do is

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.770 
different areas that's one thing I do is
when<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:57.240> dry<00:04:57.479> season<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.020> do<00:04:59.539> think<00:05:00.539> about

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
when I in dry season I do think about

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.340 
when I in dry season I do think about
that<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.970> trip<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.330> did<00:05:03.479> not<00:05:03.600> bring<00:05:03.780> my<00:05:03.960> filter

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
that this trip I did not bring my filter

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.080 
that this trip I did not bring my filter
which<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.830> normally<00:05:05.370> something<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.789> would<00:05:05.940> do

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
which is normally something I would do

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.310 
which is normally something I would do
if<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.270> was<00:05:06.389> going<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.539> camp<00:05:06.750> in<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:06.990> air<00:05:07.169> hado

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
if I was going to camp in this air hado

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.870 
if I was going to camp in this air hado
I'd<00:05:07.560> bring<00:05:07.740> my<00:05:07.800> filter<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.430> could<00:05:08.610> filter

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
I'd bring my filter so I could filter

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.390 
I'd bring my filter so I could filter
that<00:05:09.000> water<00:05:09.210> if<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.539> ever<00:05:09.630> had<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.110> but<00:05:11.010> knowing

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
that water if I ever had to but knowing

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.279 
that water if I ever had to but knowing
the<00:05:11.490> area<00:05:11.639> knowing<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.240> water<00:05:12.450> sources<00:05:13.080> that

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
the area knowing the water sources that

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.719 
the area knowing the water sources that
we<00:05:13.440> have<00:05:13.470> around<00:05:13.889> here<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.130> didn't<00:05:14.400> bother<00:05:14.490> to

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
we have around here I didn't bother to

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.540 
we have around here I didn't bother to
do<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.030> on<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.270> trip<00:05:16.100> through<00:05:17.100> collection

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
do that on this trip through collection

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.300 
do that on this trip through collection
is<00:05:17.639> definitely<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.180> viable<00:05:19.100> method<00:05:20.100> for

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
is definitely a viable method for

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.920 
is definitely a viable method for
collecting<00:05:21.080> water

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
collecting water

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.530 
collecting water
it's<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.740> lot<00:05:24.890> more<00:05:25.160> effective<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:26.120> collect<00:05:26.360> due

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
it's a lot more effective to collect due

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.120 
it's a lot more effective to collect due
than<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.110> make<00:05:27.200> a<00:05:27.260> solar<00:05:27.650> still<00:05:27.920> or<00:05:28.100> a

than it is to make a solar still or a

than it is to make a solar still or a
lot<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.550> different<00:05:28.850> methods<00:05:29.240> bagging

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
lot of different methods bagging

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.680 
lot of different methods bagging
branches<00:05:30.230> and<00:05:30.380> things<00:05:30.530> like<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:31.390> those<00:05:32.390> give

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
branches and things like that those give

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.750 
branches and things like that those give
you<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.870> few<00:05:33.290> milliliters<00:05:33.890> of<00:05:33.920> water<00:05:34.220> each<00:05:34.490> one

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
you a few milliliters of water each one

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.790 
you a few milliliters of water each one
they<00:05:34.970> don't<00:05:35.150> create<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.810> lot<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.050> water<00:05:36.350> but<00:05:36.620> do

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
they don't create a lot of water but do

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.410 
they don't create a lot of water but do
collection<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.520> literally<00:05:37.940> this<00:05:38.120> this

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
collection but literally this this

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.080 
collection but literally this this
landscape<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:39.050> soaked<00:05:39.320> with<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:40.520> if<00:05:40.880> you

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
landscape is soaked with it so if you

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.520 
landscape is soaked with it so if you
collect<00:05:41.420> that<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.780> will<00:05:41.960> get<00:05:42.140> some<00:05:42.500> really

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
collect that you will get some really

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.580 
collect that you will get some really
skanky<00:05:43.430> looking<00:05:43.790> brown<00:05:44.120> water<00:05:44.480> which<00:05:45.260> has<00:05:45.470> to

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
skanky looking brown water which has to

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.410 
skanky looking brown water which has to
be<00:05:45.680> filtered<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:46.160> treated<00:05:46.520> but<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:47.060> will<00:05:47.210> keep

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
be filtered and treated but it will keep

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.690 
be filtered and treated but it will keep
you<00:05:47.540> alive
