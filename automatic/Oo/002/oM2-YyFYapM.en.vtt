00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello youtube friends we are here in 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.330
 another video from tutor frank 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.780
 good and as I promised them I'm going to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.769
 teach how to use the curio alcorinos and 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.349
 5 x 5 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.410
 and good to use them first we will have 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.910
 q to know is practically hub 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.570
 they are composed of a center 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 some edges with corners 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 practically the cubes that are veiled 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.900
 peers do not have a center as more 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.860
 do not move them because you do not have any other 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.140
 common circle 2 by 2 4 by 4 6 by 6 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 and 8 by 8 that until now are the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.830
 that I know the ones that I have 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.690
 good presence I'm also going to 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.170
 point out the real names of the cubes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.050
 and then usually if they are known as the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 rugby game so much for both but not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 really, they have a name in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.579
 special that I 'm going to teach you in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 this video good the first as you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 I said will teach you how to use the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 algorithms for that we 're going to locate 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.710
 at any stage of the color cube that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.190
 more I like we are going to locate ourselves in the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.140
 White color 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.170
 for that what we are going to do is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.400
 following 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 of how you can take into account the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.759
 right and left of right 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.909
 left when the gigs to 5 x 5 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.610
 it was named big vdd as a little girl 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.080
 talks about how big it is from outside and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 of the little girl who is in there 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 then let's say we 're going to make 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 Chiquita big twice we said the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.770
 two and cradle twice as we give each other 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.799
 account then we left the yellows 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.780
 we are going to return the large learners 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.630
 of chiquitas twice the league we go 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 always down then it will be 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.750
 by simple logic of the same color returned 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is especially noticeable that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.270
 tiny are these two what indicates 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 here and big and small are considered 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.049
 the two of us on the other side let's do the example 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.380
 and big and small twice 12 we 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.230
 the yellow was left and we returned and big 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.350
 and tiny twice 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.010
 and we will be again 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.010
 the love 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.630
 that's the simplest things that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.250
 you can look better but 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.200
 let's keep in mind what 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.200
 besides those there are also 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.360
 s &amp; p 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.519
 and as they sign their own letters as 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.870
 let's keep in mind that it will be the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.019
 top layer 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.400
 two months 12 yellow for the other 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.900
 side to twice with the two yellow 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.849
 efe 2 and this is going to be is that is the face 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.480
 front 12 so it stayed green that was 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.560
 blue return both for the other 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.980
 side is going to stay green here blue and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.980
 which good let's go to women then 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.609
 we have already learned much of what 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.439
 consist of the algorithms in this that 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.440
 normally these algorithms and or 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.079
 name in Spanish because it's easier 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.970
 that in itself to learn the but so 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.220
 these algorithms also have their 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.579
 function in English that is where really 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.440
 they must be pronounced which also 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.230
 I'll explain it to you right now in case 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.599
 some other video that is not mine 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.030
 they disappear then or they are considered 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.190
 both in this one and in the three good 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.750
 this one can 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 name like him 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.630
 efe and you rear right front efe 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.520
 and left up and you back well 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.630
 that is the paramount thing to have the 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.260
 algorithms and carry out what is q 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:09.350
 well let's continue to assume that 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.380
 when I say as a little kid 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.060
 premium is indicated as it turns towards the other 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.910
 side 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.340
 then what does it consist of will always demand 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.859
 a to the side of the hands of the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 watch that in this case we are the f1 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.810
 we turn once to the right side 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.900
 towards the high side at the hands of the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.840
 watch but if we say f prime we throw 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.380
 to the opposite side we are going to make a 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.780
 try with another one of great of small 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.440
 prima then it is assumed that these where 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.840
 big team 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.300
 by turning the chair next to this big 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.240
 as a kid to do this we would be 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.950
 of big of normal small because 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.990
 we would be creating like this next to 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.510
 clock hands in the case 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.720
 contrary like this the little one on top 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 we throw it down 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.920
 we go to the left side 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.270
 and big as a little cousin in this case 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.790
 when we turn it is going down 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.250
 so when it's premium we upload this 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.340
 You can also understand how it stops you 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.930
 up and down is normal for 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.060
 rail for is one of the most ways 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.830
 simple to learn what you can without 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.110
 keep in mind the movements because 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.870
 really follow an algorithm is not 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.880
 simple I still like that I'm still wrong 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.660
 much in following algorithms and then I lose 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.700
 much of what we bring the juice and 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.290
 the third island yesterday day because it is what 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.920
 same to the side of the hands 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.550
 of the clock expresses and this is a bonus and 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.300
 back then we located this this 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.980
 this way and here this cousin and 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.419
 it's totally opposite and this one comes 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.460
 take out this one comes out successively 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.409
 It consists of the ass in the case that I give them 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.819
 he said English is supposed to 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.069
 these are named as follows is 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:08.099
 named with the letters 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:10.439
 efe of one of them and really wants to 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.809
 I find it more difficult to second because 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:16.259
 he is that because in Spanish it is everything is more 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:17.369
 simple but good that is still 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.139
 front 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:23.550
 efe will never take away what is behind 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.199
 so then in the description of this 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.399
 video yes I will place them 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:33.989
 efe is equal to tof5 to the f b equals 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:35.579
 tve is equal to that is equal to this one that 

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.519
 this can also be considered as 

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:43.559
 bird I would consider it as a serious 

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:46.189
 down and left to read and you're 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.189
 right 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:55.780
 good those and these are also can be 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.580
 consider as capital letter those that 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.440
 I just pronounced and it 's tiny 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.590
 when they are both as in the case of 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:07.430
 big girl would be used 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.350
 r r lower case but that are already algorithms 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.210
 more advanced you can consider that 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.370
 they study that information because they are 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.990
 would leave in the description of the video and 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.520
 well the main objective was that 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.370
 you will learn to use these 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.590
 algorithms for the construction of this 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.160
 same bucket for construction and 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.220
 form of weapon played them ruiz 5 x 5 is the 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.640
 objective of the video me in the description 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.860
 I'll leave if algorithms 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.020
 so they are pending and know how 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:41.860
 put together the good of the like manito up 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.860
 See you later
