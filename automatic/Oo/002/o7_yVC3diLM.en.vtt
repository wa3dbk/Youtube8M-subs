00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello I'm here at Luther school so what

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:14.620 
hello I'm here at Luther school so what
the<00:00:06.410> main<00:00:06.620> greenhouse<00:00:06.979> is<00:00:13.179> well<00:00:14.179> today<00:00:14.450> we're

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
the main greenhouse is well today we're

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.540 
the main greenhouse is well today we're
going<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:14.840> go<00:00:14.929> up<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.320> mic<00:00:15.620> drop<00:00:15.860> laps<00:00:16.189> and

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
going to go up to the mic drop laps and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.300 
going to go up to the mic drop laps and
use<00:00:16.849> our<00:00:17.000> micro<00:00:17.480> facilities<00:00:18.050> to<00:00:18.439> show<00:00:19.040> you<00:00:19.099> our

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
use our micro facilities to show you our

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.920 
use our micro facilities to show you our
techniques<00:00:19.790> and<00:00:20.029> replating<00:00:20.599> orchid

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
techniques and replating orchid

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.409 
techniques and replating orchid
seedlings<00:00:23.619> so<00:00:24.619> here<00:00:24.829> we<00:00:24.950> have<00:00:25.189> Zoe<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.090> ramier

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
seedlings so here we have Zoe and ramier

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.139 
seedlings so here we have Zoe and ramier
who<00:00:26.720> are<00:00:26.989> sterilizing<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.279> bench<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:28.880> any

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
who are sterilizing the bench and any

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.749 
who are sterilizing the bench and any
tools<00:00:29.509> that<00:00:29.750> they'll<00:00:29.930> use<00:00:29.960> ready<00:00:30.919> to<00:00:31.220> do<00:00:31.640> the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
tools that they'll use ready to do the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.000 
tools that they'll use ready to do the
replating<00:00:32.329> why<00:00:33.230> do<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.440> have<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.710> sterilize

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
replating why do you have to sterilize

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.959 
replating why do you have to sterilize
everything

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
everything

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.090 
everything
well<00:00:35.480> we<00:00:35.570> sterilize<00:00:36.050> everything<00:00:36.440> because<00:00:36.950> in

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
well we sterilize everything because in

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.590 
well we sterilize everything because in
the<00:00:37.190> wild<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.700> orchids<00:00:38.030> would<00:00:38.210> dry<00:00:38.420> on<00:00:38.570> a

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the wild the orchids would dry on a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.560 
the wild the orchids would dry on a
micro<00:00:38.960> Raizel<00:00:39.320> fungus<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:40.820> give<00:00:41.210> them<00:00:41.390> the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
micro Raizel fungus to give them the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.060 
micro Raizel fungus to give them the
glucose<00:00:42.080> they<00:00:42.290> need<00:00:42.440> for<00:00:42.620> germination

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
glucose they need for germination

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.280 
glucose they need for germination
because<00:00:44.060> we<00:00:44.210> don't<00:00:44.450> have<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.840> mycorrhizal

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
because we don't have the mycorrhizal

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.760 
because we don't have the mycorrhizal
fungus<00:00:45.800> we<00:00:46.130> have<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.520> use<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:47.180> gar<00:00:47.510> jelly<00:00:47.780> which

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
fungus we have to use a gar jelly which

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.830 
fungus we have to use a gar jelly which
is<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.950> problem<00:00:49.250> because<00:00:49.640> agar<00:00:50.360> is<00:00:50.510> commonly

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
is a problem because agar is commonly

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.650 
is a problem because agar is commonly
used<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.260> grow<00:00:51.620> bacteria<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:53.270> we<00:00:53.450> had<00:00:53.630> a

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
used to grow bacteria and if we had a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.990 
used to grow bacteria and if we had a
single<00:00:54.110> bacterium<00:00:54.260> or<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.950> single<00:00:55.520> fungus

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
single bacterium or a single fungus

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.050 
single bacterium or a single fungus
Spore<00:00:56.300> we'd<00:00:56.750> lose<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.230> whole<00:00:57.380> jar<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.850> why<00:00:59.000> do

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
Spore we'd lose the whole jar so why do

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.450 
Spore we'd lose the whole jar so why do
you<00:00:59.210> have<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.540> replace<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.079> orchids<00:01:00.500> we

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
you have to replace the orchids we

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.889 
you have to replace the orchids we
replate<00:01:01.910> them<00:01:02.120> because<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.540> seed<00:01:02.750> is

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
replate them because the seed is

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.749 
replate them because the seed is
incredibly<00:01:03.440> fine<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.040> when<00:01:04.159> we<00:01:04.250> sew<00:01:04.519> them

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
incredibly fine and when we sew them

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.620 
incredibly fine and when we sew them
we'll<00:01:05.030> sew<00:01:05.299> 10,000<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.259> so<00:01:06.290> seeds<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:07.040> one<00:01:07.189> jar

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
we'll sew 10,000 or so seeds in one jar

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.180 
we'll sew 10,000 or so seeds in one jar
when<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.530> stage<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.070> they're

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
when we get to the stage that they're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.070 
when we get to the stage that they're
two<00:01:10.400> years<00:01:10.430> old<00:01:10.790> they'll<00:01:11.150> only<00:01:11.330> be<00:01:11.450> about<00:01:11.750> 10

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
two years old they'll only be about 10

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200 
two years old they'll only be about 10
orchids<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.620> each<00:01:12.740> jar<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.790> along<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.180> way

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
orchids in each jar so along the way

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.030 
orchids in each jar so along the way
about<00:01:14.570> five<00:01:14.810> or<00:01:14.990> six<00:01:15.140> times<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:15.770> have<00:01:15.920> to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
about five or six times we have to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.740 
about five or six times we have to
replate<00:01:16.400> them<00:01:16.640> which<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.270> basically

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
replate them which is basically

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
replate them which is basically
splitting<00:01:18.260> them<00:01:18.470> up<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.090> encouraging<00:01:20.090> them

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
splitting them up and encouraging them

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.780 
splitting them up and encouraging them
to<00:01:20.299> grow<00:01:20.810> roots<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.500> leaves<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.370> therefore

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
to grow roots and leaves and therefore

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:47.410 
to grow roots and leaves and therefore
become<00:01:23.180> bigger<00:01:23.450> plants

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.600 

so<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> sip<00:01:49.170> idiom<00:01:49.500> arif<00:01:49.770> asylum<00:01:50.370> as

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so this is a sip idiom arif asylum as

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
so this is a sip idiom arif asylum as
from<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> Himalayas<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> what

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
from the Himalayas and this is what

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.410 
from the Himalayas and this is what
those<00:01:53.010> little<00:01:53.250> plants<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.850> grow<00:01:53.940> into<00:01:54.180> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
those little plants will grow into in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.550 
those little plants will grow into in
about<00:01:54.600> four<00:01:54.840> years<00:01:55.020> time

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
about four years time

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.770 
about four years time
pretty<00:01:56.100> four<00:01:56.520> years<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.970> takes<00:01:57.210> lap<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> lot

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
pretty four years it takes lap a lot

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
pretty four years it takes lap a lot
yeah<00:01:58.290> they're<00:01:58.530> very<00:01:58.560> beautiful<00:01:58.860> plants<00:01:59.460> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
yeah they're very beautiful plants but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.830 
yeah they're very beautiful plants but
do<00:01:59.820> need<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> patience<00:02:02.630> thank<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.720> for
