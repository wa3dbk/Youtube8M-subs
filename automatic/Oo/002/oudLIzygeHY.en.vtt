00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
you to drop down guardians in your spawn

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880 
you to drop down guardians in your spawn
and<00:01:47.510> keep<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.780> enemy<00:01:47.900> spawning<00:01:48.350> in<00:01:48.530> one<00:01:48.650> place

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
so you can keep spawn trapping them I

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.970 
so you can keep spawn trapping them I
think<00:01:51.080> we<00:01:51.140> know<00:01:51.260> where<00:01:51.410> I'm<00:01:51.560> going<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:51.920> this

duty 4 modern warfare 2 that intimacy
was<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> lot<00:04:06.290> more<00:04:06.410> present<00:04:06.950> because<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.610> could

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
was a lot more present because you could

got<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.799> I<00:04:12.860> think<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.190> level<00:04:13.430> 44

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
got to that I think it's the level 44

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.210 
got to that I think it's the level 44
for<00:04:14.209> dead<00:04:14.360> silence<00:04:14.810> i'm<00:04:14.959> bloody<00:04:15.260> striving<00:04:16.070> to

for dead silence i'm bloody striving to
get<00:04:16.370> dead<00:04:16.609> silence<00:04:17.090> because<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:17.660> would<00:04:17.780> make

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
get dead silence because it would make

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.479 
get dead silence because it would make
my<00:04:18.139> free<00:04:18.440> fall<00:04:18.620> experience<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.160> lot<00:04:19.340> more

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
my free fall experience a lot more

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.129 
my free fall experience a lot more
easier<00:04:19.820> because<00:04:19.970> people<00:04:20.389> generally<00:04:20.750> don't

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
easier because people generally don't

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.690 
easier because people generally don't
wear<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.620> they<00:04:21.799> wear<00:04:22.010> other<00:04:22.220> things<00:04:22.520> that
