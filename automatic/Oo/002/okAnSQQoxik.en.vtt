00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:14.040
 you know what day 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 no me either it's the holidays I 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 do not know you but I noticed that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.430
 since the arrival of social networks 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.279
 there were more and more people 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 especially girls who thought that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.090
 photographers especially girls that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.100
 good no just no and I speak in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 knowingly I am son of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 Photographers 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 eckert good besides about it there we 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 going to do a little parenthesis actually 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.320
 even among real photographers of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.270
 once you all about questions 1 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.180
 for example is that someone can 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.559
 explain to me why this is the photo 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.559
 which has sold the most expensive in the world 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.780
 seriously what do you have your three lines 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.680
 water the earth the sky to wayne we put 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.869
 this photo is for the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.299
 the artists wen at the same time 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 do not understand already there is debate of the fed 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the photo there is absolutely no 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.820
 trace of life while yet there is the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 presence of air from the water of the earth 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.640
 in other words the three elements that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.690
 are the basis of all life yeah 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 you understand a cult yeah no I'm 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.160
 went looking for that one no people 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 reassure me there is nothing extraordinary 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.800
 in this picture I do it to you too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 and then anyway the best 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:50.070
 firmament two there is not the question 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.050
 I'm talking about these shit photos 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.479
 picture even more crappy 1 we get 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 includes six teams to him your son 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.369
 you know it's a name 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.119
 the go girls like that it's 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.280
 not if the only son is the one who is and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.280
 no salsify 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.170
 not serious that I love smartphones 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.820
 but when I see that in girls 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.080
 the only function is the camera 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.390
 I say shit why engineers 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.330
 they are pissed off to innovate except the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.650
 ipod nothing on hawai and no but wait 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.060
 I contradict myself there in fact they have little 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.739
 understood to no but how do I start 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.299
 I troll month when how do you want that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.750
 I troll there you explain to me how I 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.700
 do that koji just need to improve 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.170
 the quality of the screen and the quality of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.209
 the camera and that will make you look like 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:52.530
 that girls will make their buttons in hd 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:55.100
 wow too beautiful what is funny 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.100
 that's where 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.200
 I have not forgotten something good and it's 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.240
 better brief I said what is funny 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.300
 it's to see the difference between a 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.770
 group of guys taking a picture and a 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.180
 group of girls taking a picture 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.820
 it's a little different 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.440
 I explain I'm not at the guys 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.880
 it's the delirium that will prevail makes everything 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.710
 it's going to be the joke the stuffed you 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.240
 possible but it will be settled in two 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.880
 minutes the story while at a 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.540
 girl and whether it's solo or in 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.630
 group 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.160
 good google there are plenty of criteria 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.040
 complicated for a photo choice to be 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.150
 successful suffered hard enough said y'a full 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.910
 criteria for a photo at a 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.500
 girl be successful 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.090
 the right haircut the good one but 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.050
 I have a little before the eyes swing style 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.780
 who a mysterious and saw the good of school 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.080
 t he not forgetting the inevitable break that 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.080
 okay 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.450
 the girls are doing so much photos that he 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.550
 would need less 3 pc for all 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.120
 store sky to keep at least 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.580
 and then I let you imagine the pure 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:10.930
 delirium that it's when they're in 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:10.930
 group is rather it is too good 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:21.690
 ok ok we are now arverne actually 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:28.860
 you're ugly so that's waiting actually 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:31.419
 to the la and after a few millennia 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.660
 for taking a picture if she is 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.759
 succeeded well the choice of the filter and there it 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.440
 becomes even more eco-friendly because 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.880
 that there are two types of girls 1 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.710
 those who love their face and who 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.960
 puts a rather light filter and the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.370
 second most fun ones those who 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.830
 do not like their mouths and who puts a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.020
 filter who fears so much their 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.889
 Tronches often seen more 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.110
 the background that makes them what 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.400
 times better after the thing I 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.400
 do not understand too much with his daughter 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.160
 also this is that by taking any 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.349
 time ie they spend their 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.490
 life to take a picture of me me who me 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.449
 raise me who eat me lunch that makes me 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.250
 better those who take pictures in 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.610
 neck matt as I believe my year 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.430
 school 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.630
 lol is why you water you could not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.840
 turn the ringtone it became a 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.840
 drug 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.050
 it's better 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.180
 good and the second thing that I 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.139
 do not understand the alpine I want a 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.050
 reply 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.699
 why are you taking pictures of yourself in 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.680
 zero places 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.849
 the last time I'm lining up at the 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.650
 canteen in high school and you said that the 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.550
 girls was taking 17 girls in the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.259
 tail of the canteen 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.180
 I do not have before the great wall of 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.669
 china the eiffel tower we see your mother ton 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.009
 dog I want but that in the canteen 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.620
 Seriously serious soon the selphy 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.610
 it will be that if you do not have useful or not 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.610
 merchant pages in a month 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.470
 it's not at all our young rate 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.470
 national or local near 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.470
 we 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.030
 this true
