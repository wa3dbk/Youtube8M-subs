00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.980
 you are watching a special video set 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.249
 video as part of testing a new 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.219
 robot vacuum cleaner samsung navibot conor 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.949
 wedge for zone b news 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.160
 and now we will check as a robot vacuum cleaner 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.410
 which is declared as a savior of angles then 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.540
 of special earned in order 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.180
 to clean 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.270
 clean the garbage from the clutches of how he will cope and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.180
 the main task of the boys to clean the corners 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.790
 for this using the remote 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.900
 remote control 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.489
 activate the normal borka mode 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.579
 automatically here so yeah 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.780
 By the way, we previously scattered 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.760
 some rubbish 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.329
 here in the corners not only in the corners also 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.030
 under the table we are generally on alert and 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.899
 Now we will see how he will cope with 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.730
 this its stated main task 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.730
 eliminate garbage in the corners of the premises 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.070
 activate the automatic cleaning mode 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.260
 suction cup and put his head will go straight 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.340
 codice retractable brushes have already worked and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.730
 having worked they were pushed again but here 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.730
 now again 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 activated 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.700
 let's see how much vacuum pores are up to 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:42.289
 time to clean the kitchen but how 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 see these retractable brushes they 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.539
 are activated not only in the corners but also 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.140
 just near the wall that is, it means 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:55.450
 that inherent must also sweep the garbage 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.450
 which is next to the baseboard 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 here by the way set a special 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:16.310
 the limiter system is called virtual 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 box 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 virtual eyes 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.810
 limiter to this vacuum cleaner 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.880
 didn't go beyond what we needed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.880
 premises I choose his involvement 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.750
 let's see he again went to the corner but 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.750
 for some reason decided not to call him now 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.960
 yes, that's just necessary or terrible 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.170
 some amount and immediately became 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.620
 We come back here again we come 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.620
 hope 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.090
 we have a special way activated 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.000
 mode is called fiction that is if 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.140
 vacuum cleaner notices trash 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.239
 large accumulation of garbage of some kind 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.310
 certain place he handles it 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.599
 more carefully that is returns to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.790
 he is sucked in by the garbage and then again 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.239
 follows that course he means what 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.239
 called 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.069
 his 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.549
 type of activation of the automatic mode 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.549
 cleaning up 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.430
 trimmed all the same in the furniture 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.849
 that is, not all pieces of furniture and not 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.019
 he always differs table legs 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.930
 actually is always a problem for 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.720
 all robot vacuum cleaners that are so on 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.959
 in shores tested like that 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.959
 standard situation 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.510
 he offends us was 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.080
 does not collect all the garbage that finds 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.450
 near it there appears a straight line inside 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.100
 took it so go on again 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.810
 to deal with the angle of the brush because they 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.100
 not fully activated not sold 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.510
 fully extends nominated to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.130
 so far as is necessary to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.169
 whichever distance the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.169
 whose princess is off the wall 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.150
 and so almost five minutes to exactly five 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.070
 minutes continues of our lesson 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:12.310
 let's a small area of â€‹â€‹the room 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:15.000
 this kitchen is not some garbage in 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.080
 corners still left 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.710
 we tried to ease the task of vacuuming 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.360
 we removed all hundred measures as you see no 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:33.250
 wires 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:36.420
 smooth floor principle or difficulty not 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.440
 should arise 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:44.440
 samsung navibot 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:47.290
 plans wings let's come liquid 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.400
 garbage yes well see what we have 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.320
 It turns out that in the opinion 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.900
 robot cleaner is so called cleaning 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.050
 graduated from the inscription and 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.050
 and 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.170
 beep sounded robot vacuum cleaner 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.180
 I will try to find a charger 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:14.410
 mom won't find it because it's worth it 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:17.670
 limiter and so trash 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.790
 debris in the corner quantity is noticeably less 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:27.420
 but something else here is even bigger and something 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:30.460
 that all the same there is no garbage here 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:34.770
 under the table well here in the corner 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.770
 something else is there 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.240
 such pay cleaning in principle 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:43.000
 the result of interest is probably 90 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.759
 90 percent even more than 95 percent 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.180
 garbage collected vacuum cleaner which is very good 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:52.240
 very much the principle of this test 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.370
 can be considered as passed because 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.270
 the perfect result the manufacturer does not 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.210
 promise the same technician at least develops but 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.840
 develops gradually 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:08.430
 ideal frequencies nobody ever 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.740
 doesn't promise it was specially shot for 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.440
 zoom si video footage progress 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.810
 Testing New Robot Vacuum Cleaner 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.620

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.620
