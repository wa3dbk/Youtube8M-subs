Dean<00:00:22.970> is<00:00:23.570> going<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:23.930> show<00:00:24.080> us<00:00:24.200> that

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
Dean is going to show us that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.749 
Dean is going to show us that
microphones<00:00:24.800> are<00:00:24.950> not<00:00:25.070> all<00:00:25.220> about<00:00:25.340> rock<00:00:25.730> and

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
microphones are not all about rock and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.580 
microphones are not all about rock and
roll<00:00:25.939> sometimes<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.110> actually<00:00:27.230> want<00:00:27.529> to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
roll sometimes you actually want to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.710 
roll sometimes you actually want to
measure<00:00:27.830> something<00:00:28.330> accurately<00:00:29.330> rather<00:00:29.570> than

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
measure something accurately rather than

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.589 
measure something accurately rather than
at<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:29.840> flavor<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.730> can<00:00:31.730> see<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.090> looks<00:00:32.390> like<00:00:32.540> a

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
at a flavor I can see this looks like a

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.540 
at a flavor I can see this looks like a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.430 
typical measurement microphone
I<00:00:34.579> guess<00:00:34.880> it's<00:00:35.090> aimed<00:00:35.239> at<00:00:35.360> people<00:00:35.450> doing<00:00:35.870> room

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
I guess it's aimed at people doing room

this maps for $2.99
and<00:01:01.250> measurement<00:01:01.580> microphones<00:01:01.970> can<00:01:02.120> be<00:01:02.150> quite

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
and measurement microphones can be quite

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.990 
and measurement microphones can be quite
expensive<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.320> now<00:01:03.470> with<00:01:03.770> systems<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.610> can

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
expensive and now with systems that can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.470 
expensive and now with systems that can
measure<00:01:05.239> up<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.770> multiple<00:01:06.770> zones<00:01:07.270> say<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:08.450> a

measure up to multiple zones say like a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.570 
measure up to multiple zones say like a
seven<00:01:08.900> zone<00:01:09.140> system<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.310> be<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.430> pretty

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
seven zone system that can be a pretty

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.580 
seven zone system that can be a pretty
expensive<00:01:10.880> bit<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.840> kit<00:01:11.990> for<00:01:12.230> all<00:01:12.470> those

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
expensive bit of kit for all those

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.840 
expensive bit of kit for all those
microphones<00:01:13.160> so<00:01:13.280> there's<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.460> very<00:01:13.640> cost

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
microphones so there's a very cost

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.730 
microphones so there's a very cost
efficient<00:01:14.270> way<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.390> go<00:01:14.660> but<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:15.470> what<00:01:15.620> we're

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
efficient way to go but now what we're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.100 
efficient way to go but now what we're
doing<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.220> we're<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.520> feature<00:01:16.760> our<00:01:16.970> tm1<00:01:17.660> Plus

windscreen<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.710> threaded<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.090> spin

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
windscreen that is threaded so you spin

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.670 
windscreen that is threaded so you spin
it<00:01:26.479> like<00:01:26.510> that<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.080> not<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.380> come<00:01:27.530> off

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
it like that it's not going to come off

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.530 
it like that it's not going to come off
with<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> gust<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.280> wind<00:01:28.490> which<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.060> pretty

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
with a gust of wind which is pretty

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.990 
with a gust of wind which is pretty
important<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.020> outside<00:01:30.380> festivals<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.700> half

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
important for outside festivals a half

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.850 
important for outside festivals a half
inch<00:01:32.210> calibration<00:01:32.869> adapter<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:33.740> can

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
inch calibration adapter so you can

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.160 
inch calibration adapter so you can
measure<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.340> microphone<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:35.960> also

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
measure the microphone and we also

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170 
measure the microphone and we also
include<00:01:36.650> with<00:01:36.830> each<00:01:36.950> one<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.280> these<00:01:37.400> systems<00:01:37.910> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
include with each one of these systems a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.990 
include with each one of these systems a
CD<00:01:38.899> with<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.649> calibration<00:01:40.190> data<00:01:40.460> for<00:01:40.790> this

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
CD with a calibration data for this

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.060 
CD with a calibration data for this
specific<00:01:41.509> microphone<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.649> can<00:01:42.770> go<00:01:42.890> right

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
specific microphone so it can go right

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.760 
specific microphone so it can go right
into<00:01:43.220> your<00:01:43.340> system<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.000> you're<00:01:44.330> ready<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.690> go

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.810 

digital<00:01:51.770> reverb<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:52.250> where<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.490> want<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
digital reverb that's where you want to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.290 
digital reverb that's where you want to
record<00:01:53.060> everything<00:01:53.330> absolutely<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:56.180> this

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
record everything absolutely and this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.520 
record everything absolutely and this
will<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.750> especially<00:01:56.869> with<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
will do it especially with the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.530 
will do it especially with the
calibration<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.460> correct<00:01:59.240> the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
calibration you can correct the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.440 
calibration you can correct the
microphone<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.970> flat

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
microphone so that it's that it's a flat

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.969 
microphone so that it's that it's a flat
in<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.660> system<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.680> use<00:02:03.800> that

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
in your system and then you can use that

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.919 
in your system and then you can use that
to<00:02:04.100> measure<00:02:04.220> by<00:02:04.819> impulses<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.600> for

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
to measure by impulses to for

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.240 
to measure by impulses to for
convolution<00:02:06.500> effects<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.920> things<00:02:07.069> like<00:02:07.190> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
convolution effects and things like that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.850
