and it almost looks like as if it's a
sticker<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> peeling<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.040> but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
sticker that this is peeling off but

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
sticker that this is peeling off but
that's<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> logo<00:01:26.880> itself<00:01:27.299> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

really<00:03:45.410> see<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.739> I'm<00:03:45.890> pretty<00:03:46.040> sure<00:03:46.190> it's<00:03:46.310> some

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
really see it I'm pretty sure it's some

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.340 
really see it I'm pretty sure it's some
type<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.610> meat<00:03:46.880> like<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.299> maybe<00:03:48.110> it's<00:03:48.290> a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
type of meat like a maybe it's a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.410 
type of meat like a maybe it's a
strawberry<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.890> have<00:03:49.220> no<00:03:49.519> clue<00:03:49.820> what<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.090> was

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
strawberry I have no clue what this was

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.620 
strawberry I have no clue what this was
to<00:03:50.540> be<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.829> has<00:03:51.980> like<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.310> end<00:03:52.459> side<00:03:52.970> like

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
to be and it has like the end side like

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.390 
to be and it has like the end side like
it's<00:03:53.780> on<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> toothpick<00:03:54.200> or<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.799> obviously

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
it's on a toothpick or like a obviously

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.650 
it's on a toothpick or like a obviously
a<00:03:55.459> kabob<00:03:55.790> skewer

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
a kabob skewer

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.740 
a kabob skewer
and<00:03:58.470> then<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.550> one<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.000> would<00:04:00.120> assume<00:04:00.540> as

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and then this one I would assume as

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.150 
and then this one I would assume as
marshmallows<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.650> you're<00:04:01.770> roasting

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
marshmallows like you're roasting

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.500 
marshmallows like you're roasting
marshmallows<00:04:02.490> on<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.760> fireplace<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.330> that's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
marshmallows on the fireplace so that's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.840 
marshmallows on the fireplace so that's
those<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.440> then<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.250> also<00:04:05.370> comes<00:04:05.610> with<00:04:05.700> a

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
those and then it also comes with a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.770 
those and then it also comes with a
crystal<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:10.610> then<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.880> includes<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.480> which

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
crystal and then it includes this which

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.110 
crystal and then it includes this which
appears<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> be<00:04:13.320> like<00:04:13.440> some<00:04:13.620> type<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:14.120> drink

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
appears to be like some type of drink

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.790 
appears to be like some type of drink
maker<00:04:17.480> maybe<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.570> hot<00:04:18.780> cocoa<00:04:19.020> maker<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.680> then

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
maker maybe a hot cocoa maker and then

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.979 
maker maybe a hot cocoa maker and then
you<00:04:19.890> could<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.400> put<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.390> inside<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you could just like put this inside it

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.680 
you could just like put this inside it
or<00:04:22.170> whatever<00:04:22.320> whatever<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.860> want<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.040> do<00:04:23.690> okay

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
so there's that those are the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.000 
so there's that those are the
accessories<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.450> side<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.020> then<00:04:28.800> as<00:04:28.890> we

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
accessories on this side and then as we

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.260 
accessories on this side and then as we
work<00:04:29.160> our<00:04:29.280> way<00:04:29.310> over<00:04:29.460> here<00:04:29.730> as<00:04:29.850> we<00:04:29.940> can<00:04:30.030> see<00:04:30.180> it

days so the place I itself includes some
furniture<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.100> furniture<00:05:32.430> consists<00:05:33.270> of

this<00:05:33.630> little<00:05:34.080> sofa<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:35.160> pretty<00:05:35.520> much<00:05:35.730> one

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
this little sofa that pretty much one

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.880 
this little sofa that pretty much one

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
doll can fit on maybe one or two because

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.470 
doll can fit on maybe one or two because
the<00:05:38.070> brass<00:05:38.220> are<00:05:38.400> kind<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.610> smaller<00:05:38.940> doll<00:05:39.240> so

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
the brass are kind of smaller doll so

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.630 
the brass are kind of smaller doll so

the brass will fit on there and then it

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.750 
the brass will fit on there and then it
has<00:05:41.850> like<00:05:41.880> this<00:05:42.300> little<00:05:43.340> hedge<00:05:44.340> like<00:05:44.670> an
