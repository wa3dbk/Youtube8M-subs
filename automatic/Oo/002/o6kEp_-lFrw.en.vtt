00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.420
 good friends then the ingredients 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.760
 to make these rich mundanes go to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.260
 be 2 cups of flour 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:25.480
 sugar a cup of milk a cup of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:30.340
 water oil three eggs I'm going to use two 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 whole and the yolk of one leaves the ground 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.240
 and salt 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 because then now to start here 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.290
 the place 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 add water 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.620
 for milk 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.480
 and the eggs 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.130
 remember that they are whole eggs 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 because they look good 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.869
 or 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.869
 Now he's going to add a pinch of salt 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.120
 are 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.900
 At the end 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.920
 I'm adding it to the flour 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920
 look for a bit 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.950
 and you have to mix or not to remain 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.409
 lumps 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.770
 Let there be a consistency as if it were 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.770
 a parasol or the parks are hot cakes 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.170
 good and there they have 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.979
 this is how the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.979
 consistency of the dough 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.700
 and all the following I have already done the 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.740
 mass I recommend you do what 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 following that they prepare in a tray 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.560
 a dish or something where they can go throwing 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.040
 the fritters with a frying pan 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.260
 with this being napkins themselves here 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.260
 so that they absorb the oil 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.130
 something more or less like that 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:45.990
 and after that I have sugar here 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.090
 with cinnamon is the cinnamon espresso is 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.820
 star of your choice if you do not want 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.820
 add or not I was always added 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 mix it well all 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 ah 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.400
 people 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.909
 then now 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.900
 is that it is done all we can already 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.900
 the following 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:28.080
 here I have oil is already heating 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.920
 you have to have the mold inside so that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.950
 it's hot and in this case I've already 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.650
 had like this for about 10 minutes 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.099
 also sound to tell them that having a 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.700
 dish with napkins aside because 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.930
 we do not remove the mold 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.930
 we do not have what 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.989
 How about the oil if you do not stick them in 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.989
 mass 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:05.520
 you can see here I put it 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.460
 and it does not show everything completely the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.090
 Sir 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.090
 untill there 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.810
 it is not here 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.010
 and it only comes out 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.850
 and you should keep this in here 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.850
 so it's always hot 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.169
 almost always good in my experience the 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.279
 first suffers does not go very well 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.279
 but after that 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.849
 go well 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.899
 and now it's the sides of browning the honey 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.899
 everywhere 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.289
 yes 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.520
 that I grab a good 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.520
 coffee color 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.870
 good friends then here I already have the 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:33.170
 fritters already made to me they came out 34 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.950
 this the amount that take depends on 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.280
 how thick they are 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:44.740
 because the more they leave the mold in the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.880
 Thicker thicker mass is made 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.160
 so that's why I tell you it depends 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.720
 this but already done then already what 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.930
 last thing that remains to be is 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.870
 Obviously, it is no longer necessary to 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.500
 sugar like that 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.500
 loneliness 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.130
 and of course they can do it in what 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.650
 the fritters are coming out true 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:17.490
 but I decided to wait for our and the 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:20.990
 last but they are and it is already the last thing 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.990
 have to do as I told them 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.520
 doing everything is true 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.039
