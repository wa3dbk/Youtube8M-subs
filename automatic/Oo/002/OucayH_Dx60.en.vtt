00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
check to see that it's clean and that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.779 
check to see that it's clean and that
it's<00:01:30.690> full<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.340> fooled<00:01:32.369> by<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
it's full and don't be fooled by this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's full and don't be fooled by this
because<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.570> possible<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.229> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because it's possible that they just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.120 
because it's possible that they just
changed<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> oil<00:01:35.009> before<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.460> looked<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
changed the oil before you looked at it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
changed the oil before you looked at it
so<00:01:38.130> something<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.580> would<00:01:38.729> recommend<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so something I would recommend is to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.609 
so something I would recommend is to
take<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.170> cap<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:41.660> remove<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.690> cap<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
take the cap off remove the cap and you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.169 
take the cap off remove the cap and you
want<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.039> at<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.250> inside<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:45.000> cap

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
want to look at the inside of the cap

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.210 
want to look at the inside of the cap
