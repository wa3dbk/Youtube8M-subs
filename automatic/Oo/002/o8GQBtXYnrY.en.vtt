completely fine and I had a little hair
that<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:50.890> wouldn't<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:51.190> back<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.670> keep

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
that just wouldn't go back so I keep

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.330 
that just wouldn't go back so I keep
paying<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.330> down<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:53.800> pin<00:04:54.010> it<00:04:54.130> until

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
paying that down so just pin it until

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.900 
paying that down so just pin it until
you<00:04:54.430> like<00:04:54.580> it

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
you like it

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.510 
you like it
you<00:04:55.780> also<00:04:56.140> make<00:04:56.410> sure<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.830> pin<00:04:57.100> down<00:04:57.130> at

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
you also make sure that you pin down at

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.280 
you also make sure that you pin down at
the<00:04:57.640> top<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.570> doesn't<00:04:58.870> slide

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
the top so that that doesn't slide

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.410 
the top so that that doesn't slide
anywhere<00:04:59.800> because<00:05:00.040> that<00:05:00.310> usually<00:05:00.670> does<00:05:00.880> and

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
anywhere because that usually does and

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.970 
anywhere because that usually does and
then<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:01.900> curled<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.230> pieces<00:05:02.560> around<00:05:02.860> my

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
then I just curled the pieces around my

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.710 
then I just curled the pieces around my
face<00:05:03.190> because<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.610> know<00:05:03.670> she<00:05:03.820> did<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.510> one

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
face because I know she did that in one
