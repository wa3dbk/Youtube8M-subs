overheating Dodge 2001 Caravan and the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330 
overheating Dodge 2001 Caravan and the
problem<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.929> had<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.469> vehicle<00:00:13.860> was<00:00:14.009> I

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
problem I had with this vehicle was I

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.019 
problem I had with this vehicle was I
lost<00:00:14.820> heat<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.980> vehicle<00:00:17.310> kept<00:00:17.520> running<00:00:17.670> hot

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
lost heat the vehicle kept running hot

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.060 
lost heat the vehicle kept running hot
it<00:00:18.960> would<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> way<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> high

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
it would go all the way up to a high

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.460 
it would go all the way up to a high
temperature<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.630> indicator<00:00:22.109> would<00:00:22.260> come

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
temperature and the indicator would come

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
temperature and the indicator would come
on<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> then<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:25.019> temperature<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.500> go

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
on and then the temperature would go

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.130 
on and then the temperature would go
down<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.160> operating<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:27.660> operating

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
down to operating at operating

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.640 
down to operating at operating
temperature<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.920> 180<00:00:29.400> 190<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:31.470> would

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
temperature about 180 190 and I would

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
temperature about 180 190 and I would
still<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.040> no<00:00:32.219> heat<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> first<00:00:33.600> thing<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
still have no heat so the first thing I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
still have no heat so the first thing I
did<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.440> hope<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> follow<00:00:35.100> me<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.489> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
did I hope you can follow me as I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.510 
did I hope you can follow me as I
changed<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.059> thermostat<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.230> ensure<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.340> was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
changed my thermostat to ensure that was

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
changed my thermostat to ensure that was
not<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> problem<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.960> check<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
not the problem and how you check the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
not the problem and how you check the
thermostat<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.010> there's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.670> hose<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.270> here

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
thermostat is there's a hose right here

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080 
thermostat is there's a hose right here
connected<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> thermostat<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
connected to the thermostat you if that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.049 
connected to the thermostat you if that
is<00:00:45.149> hot<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> holes<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.760> at<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is hot and the holes down here at the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.020 
is hot and the holes down here at the
bottom<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> radiator<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> cool<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bottom of the radiator that is cool you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
bottom of the radiator that is cool you
can<00:00:51.210> tell<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.719> thermostat<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> stuck

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
can tell that your thermostat is stuck

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.750 
can tell that your thermostat is stuck
closed<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.570> working<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.760> well

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
closed and it's not working for you well

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.240 
closed and it's not working for you well
I<00:00:56.969> checked<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> problem<00:00:58.160> replace<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I checked that problem replace the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.810 
I checked that problem replace the
thermostat<00:00:59.930> still<00:01:00.930> had<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> problem<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.579> next

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
thermostat still had the problem so next

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
thermostat still had the problem so next
thing<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.120> looked<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:05.720> my<00:01:06.720> radiator<00:01:07.080> cap

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
thing I looked at was my radiator cap

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.550 
thing I looked at was my radiator cap
I<00:01:08.510> changed<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> radiator<00:01:09.990> cap<00:01:10.170> because

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I changed the radiator cap because

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
I changed the radiator cap because
sometimes<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> cats<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:12.600> bad<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
sometimes really the cats go bad that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.890 
sometimes really the cats go bad that
means<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> won't<00:01:14.310> function<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.240> lets<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
means it won't function as it lets the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620 
means it won't function as it lets the
fluid<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.920> bottle<00:01:17.390> that's<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fluid go to your bottle that's down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
fluid go to your bottle that's down
there<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.409> coolant<00:01:19.770> bottle<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.310> suck<00:01:20.759> back

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
there your coolant bottle and suck back

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.590 
there your coolant bottle and suck back
up<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:22.350> keep<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> vehicle<00:01:22.830> cool

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
up to keep the vehicle cool

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
up to keep the vehicle cool
well<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.740> problem<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> took

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well that was not my problem so I took

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.679 
well that was not my problem so I took
it<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> mechanic<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.250> he<00:01:29.850> said<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.509> could

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it to a mechanic and he said what could

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
it to a mechanic and he said what could
be<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> problem<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.979> might<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.250> Eric

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
be the problem is there might be Eric

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
be the problem is there might be Eric
skating<00:01:33.680> from<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.920> engine<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.670> your

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
skating from your engine into your

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.440 
skating from your engine into your
cooling<00:01:36.240> system<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.220> when<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> happens<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
cooling system and when that happens it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.310 
cooling system and when that happens it
cause<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> temperature<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:41.119> well<00:01:42.320> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
cause the temperature to go up well that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.539 
cause the temperature to go up well that
was<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> problem<00:01:44.220> either

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
was not the problem either

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.090 
was not the problem either
I<00:01:44.729> took<00:01:45.630> some<00:01:45.960> Blue<00:01:46.110> Devil<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> into

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I took some Blue Devil and I put it into

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.280 
I took some Blue Devil and I put it into
the<00:01:47.189> engine<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.570> happened<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the engine and what happened was the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
the engine and what happened was the
vehicle<00:01:49.700> didn't<00:01:50.700> run<00:01:50.880> hot<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.329> much<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
vehicle didn't run hot as much but I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.499 
vehicle didn't run hot as much but I
still<00:01:52.829> had<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> same<00:01:53.250> problem<00:01:53.759> high

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
still had the same problem high

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.010 
still had the same problem high
temperatures<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.520> no<00:01:56.520> hot<00:01:56.969> air<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
temperatures and no hot air in the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100 
temperatures and no hot air in the
vehicle<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> next<00:01:59.939> thing<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> did<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
vehicle so the next thing I did was I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.480 
vehicle so the next thing I did was I
had<00:02:01.350> my<00:02:01.890> heater<00:02:02.610> core<00:02:02.729> flush<00:02:04.219> flushed<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
had my heater core flush flushed and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.680 
had my heater core flush flushed and
blown<00:02:05.909> out

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
blown out

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.100 
blown out
that<00:02:07.320> didn't<00:02:07.590> work<00:02:07.740> either<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.720> now<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:09.900> stuck

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that didn't work either so now I'm stuck

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.840 
that didn't work either so now I'm stuck
with<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.350> vehicle<00:02:10.380> possible<00:02:11.250> blown<00:02:11.580> head

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
with the vehicle possible blown head

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.780 
with the vehicle possible blown head
gasket<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.200> could<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.620> figure<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.190> why<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
gasket and I could not figure out why I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.080 
gasket and I could not figure out why I
did<00:02:15.450> not<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.900> any<00:02:16.560> heat<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.430> why<00:02:17.820> was<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
did not have any heat and why was the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.890 
did not have any heat and why was the
vehicle<00:02:18.300> still<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.510> vehicle

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
vehicle still going up there was vehicle

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.050 
vehicle still going up there was vehicle
temperatures<00:02:22.230> still<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
temperatures still going up so then I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
temperatures still going up so then I
changed<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.960> look<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.410> noticed<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
changed I look and I noticed that one of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.130 
changed I look and I noticed that one of
my<00:02:26.220> fans<00:02:26.490> wasn't<00:02:26.910> working<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.420> replaced<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
my fans wasn't working I replaced the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.520 
my fans wasn't working I replaced the
fan<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.860> same<00:02:29.730> thing<00:02:29.960> until<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.140> went<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
fan to it same thing until I went to a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.580 
fan to it same thing until I went to a
mechanic<00:02:32.010> again<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.670> here's<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.510> he<00:02:33.600> did<00:02:33.840> he

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
mechanic again and here's what he did he

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.550 
mechanic again and here's what he did he
removed<00:02:35.040> as<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.520> vehicle<00:02:36.120> was<00:02:36.210> running<00:02:36.630> he

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
removed as the vehicle was running he

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.810 
removed as the vehicle was running he
removed<00:02:38.030> my<00:02:39.030> radiator<00:02:39.330> cap<00:02:43.550> looked<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:44.670> my

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
removed my radiator cap looked at my

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.940 
removed my radiator cap looked at my
level<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.390> noticed<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:47.490> was<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.760> circulating

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
level and noticed it was not circulating

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.130 
level and noticed it was not circulating
now<00:02:49.950> from<00:02:50.280> history<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.360> tend<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> understand

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
now from history we tend to understand

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.620 
now from history we tend to understand
that<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.430> water<00:02:56.700> pump<00:02:57.030> problem

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
that when we have a water pump problem

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.870 
that when we have a water pump problem
the<00:02:57.960> water<00:02:58.200> pump<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.650> designed<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:59.160> leak<00:02:59.460> and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the water pump is designed to leak and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.430 
the water pump is designed to leak and
leave<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> spot<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.690> front<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> vehicle<00:03:01.170> to

leave a spot in front of the vehicle to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.140 
leave a spot in front of the vehicle to
let<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.710> know<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.070> been<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:03.030> been

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.260 

in<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.709> diagram<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:15.060> typical

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
in this diagram this is your typical

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.740 
in this diagram this is your typical
inside<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.930> your<00:03:16.050> water<00:03:16.260> pump<00:03:17.120> as<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.330> flow

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
inside of your water pump as a flow

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.110 
inside of your water pump as a flow
where<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.530> comes<00:03:19.739> out<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> radiator<00:03:20.730> into

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
where it comes out of the radiator into

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.410 
where it comes out of the radiator into
the<00:03:21.360> engine<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.190> problem<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.640> had<00:03:23.910> was<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the engine but the problem I had was the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.630 
the engine but the problem I had was the
blades<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> inside<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.130> water<00:03:26.370> pump

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
blades on the inside of the water pump

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.699 
blades on the inside of the water pump
were<00:03:27.090> broken<00:03:27.650> which<00:03:28.650> caused<00:03:28.980> no<00:03:29.700> circulation

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
were broken which caused no circulation

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.720 
were broken which caused no circulation
from<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.890> engine<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.880> radiator<00:03:33.510> and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
from the engine to the radiator and

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.990 
from the engine to the radiator and
forcing<00:03:35.730> fluid<00:03:36.600> down<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.260> heater<00:03:37.470> core<00:03:38.000> so

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
forcing fluid down to the heater core so

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.490 
forcing fluid down to the heater core so
once<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.019> water<00:03:40.470> pump<00:03:41.100> was<00:03:41.250> replaced<00:03:42.500> my

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
once the water pump was replaced my

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.110 
once the water pump was replaced my
problem<00:03:43.920> was<00:03:44.040> solved<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> don't<00:03:46.230> forget<00:03:46.500> that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
problem was solved so don't forget that

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.880 
problem was solved so don't forget that
sometimes<00:03:48.120> when<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> water<00:03:48.660> pump<00:03:48.959> goes<00:03:49.200> bad<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
sometimes when a water pump goes bad it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.530 
sometimes when a water pump goes bad it
doesn't<00:03:50.580> cause<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> leak

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
doesn't cause a leak

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.750 
doesn't cause a leak
