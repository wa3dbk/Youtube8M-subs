00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
two balls and a third and add and by

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.020 
two balls and a third and add and by
removing<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:34.059> one<00:00:35.280> what's<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.460> result<00:00:36.579> of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
removing just one what's the result of

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.000 
removing just one what's the result of
that<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:40.059> said<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.329> how<00:00:41.170> wrong<00:00:41.620> you<00:00:41.890> would

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
that if you said to how wrong you would

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.939 
that if you said to how wrong you would
be<00:00:42.219> because<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.989> total<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:45.329> no<00:00:46.329> less<00:00:46.600> than

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
be because the total is no less than

00:00:46.949 --> 00:01:00.270 
be because the total is no less than
three<00:00:50.069> one<00:00:51.069> ball<00:00:54.929> two<00:00:55.929> balls<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:59.039> third<00:01:00.039> in

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
the Hat and by removing just one what's

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.960 
the Hat and by removing just one what's
the<00:01:06.610> result<00:01:06.760> of<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:09.340> if<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:09.700> said<00:01:09.940> to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
the result of that now if you said to

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.870 
the result of that now if you said to
and<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:11.050> was<00:01:11.230> your<00:01:11.380> guests<00:01:11.800> I'd<00:01:12.550> say<00:01:12.820> try

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
and that was your guests I'd say try

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.410 
and that was your guests I'd say try
again<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:14.130> answer<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:16.270> less<00:01:17.910> now<00:01:18.910> if<00:01:19.240> that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
again and answer one less now if that

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.650 
again and answer one less now if that
was<00:01:19.600> too<00:01:19.810> fast<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.950> do<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.310> once<00:01:21.520> more<00:01:21.820> this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
was too fast I can do it once more this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.130 

and<00:01:41.390> by<00:01:42.049> removing<00:01:42.590> one<00:01:42.799> invisibly<00:01:43.899> what's<00:01:44.899> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
and by removing one invisibly what's the

result of that well if you sit three

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.090 
result of that well if you sit three
you'd<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.610> partially<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.799> except<00:01:51.799> for<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
you'd be partially right except for the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:03.149 
you'd be partially right except for the
fact<00:01:52.570> they're<00:01:53.570> now<00:01:53.780> blue<00:01:54.700> red<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.740> white

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
wave of the wand and a puzzling rhyme

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.380 
wave of the wand and a puzzling rhyme
there's<00:02:19.670> still<00:02:19.910> three<00:02:20.150> balls<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.739> take<00:02:22.390> one

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
there's still three balls do I take one

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.960 
there's still three balls do I take one
away<00:02:23.709> which<00:02:24.709> leaves<00:02:25.010> how<00:02:25.310> many<00:02:25.579> would<00:02:25.910> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
away which leaves how many would you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.819 
away which leaves how many would you
care<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.870> say<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.819> say<00:02:29.180> three<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.829> cannot

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
care to say if you say three I cannot

care to say if you say three I cannot
agree<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:32.420> said<00:02:32.660> two<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.709> simply<00:02:34.099> not

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
agree if you said two it's simply not

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.449 
agree if you said two it's simply not
true<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.110> said<00:02:36.349> one<00:02:36.620> you'd<00:02:37.310> be

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
true but if you said one you'd be

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.080 
true but if you said one you'd be
partially<00:02:38.030> right<00:02:38.829> except<00:02:39.829> it's<00:02:40.099> much<00:02:40.459> larger

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
partially right except it's much larger

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.099 
and no longer white well I hope you
enjoy<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.250> mystery<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.109> the

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
enjoy this little mystery and the

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.129 
enjoy this little mystery and the
display<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.680> dexterity<00:02:49.489> but<00:02:49.989> remember<00:02:50.989> it

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
display of dexterity but remember it

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.470 
display of dexterity but remember it
wasn't<00:02:51.500> an<00:02:51.829> illusion<00:02:52.280> nor<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.239> trick

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
wasn't an illusion nor was it a trick

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.930 
wasn't an illusion nor was it a trick
but<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.709> curious<00:02:55.160> type<00:02:55.549> of<00:02:56.560> arithmetic

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
but just a curious type of arithmetic

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.390 
but just a curious type of arithmetic
you<00:02:58.940> where<00:02:59.900> does<00:03:00.079> it<00:03:00.109> go<00:03:00.290> where<00:03:00.920> does<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.100> wind

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
you where does it go where does it wind

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.599 
you where does it go where does it wind
up<00:03:01.579> well<00:03:01.880> there's<00:03:02.120> only<00:03:02.239> one<00:03:02.450> place<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:03.079> this

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
up well there's only one place in this

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.920 
up well there's only one place in this
under<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:04.700> cub<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:06.410> more<00:03:06.590> ball<00:03:07.720> way<00:03:08.720> does<00:03:08.900> it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
under the cub one more ball way does it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.879 
under the cub one more ball way does it
go<00:03:09.549> under<00:03:10.549> Cup<00:03:10.819> number<00:03:11.510> three<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.989> don't<00:03:12.829> think

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
go under Cup number three I don't think

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.309 
go under Cup number three I don't think
so<00:03:13.099> but<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.209> little<00:03:14.329> ball<00:03:14.599> cannot<00:03:14.959> vanish

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
so but that little ball cannot vanish

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.129 
so but that little ball cannot vanish
without<00:03:15.500> leaving<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.250> trace<00:03:16.720> where<00:03:17.720> does<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.900> go

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
without leaving a trace where does it go

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.420 
without leaving a trace where does it go
well<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:19.400> usual<00:03:19.790> place<00:03:20.620> now<00:03:21.620> don't<00:03:21.980> blink<00:03:22.280> now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
well the usual place now don't blink now

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.670 
well the usual place now don't blink now
because<00:03:22.819> what<00:03:23.000> you're<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.389> see<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:24.410> this

because what you're about to see is this

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.729 
because what you're about to see is this
little<00:03:25.010> ball<00:03:25.160> penetrate<00:03:25.819> through<00:03:26.530> until<00:03:27.530> we

little ball penetrate through until we

little ball penetrate through until we
have<00:03:28.010> one<00:03:28.549> two<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.169> three

one goal two balls and a third one now
watch<00:03:42.150> very<00:03:42.600> carefully<00:03:42.930> because<00:03:43.380> I'm<00:03:43.740> just

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
watch very carefully because I'm just

silver<00:06:43.100> to<00:06:44.180> Chinese<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:47.580> with<00:06:47.760> a<00:06:47.790> tap<00:06:48.120> of<00:06:48.390> the

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
silver to Chinese and with a tap of the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.770 
silver to Chinese and with a tap of the
hand<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:51.419> a<00:06:51.750> magical<00:06:52.229> squeeze<00:06:53.540> what's<00:06:54.540> in<00:06:54.690> the

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
hand and a magical squeeze what's in the

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.000 
hand and a magical squeeze what's in the
hand<00:06:55.100> what<00:06:56.100> does<00:06:56.250> it<00:06:56.370> hold<00:06:56.750> maybe<00:06:57.750> some<00:06:58.470> silver

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
hand what does it hold maybe some silver

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.250 
hand what does it hold maybe some silver
or<00:06:59.850> maybe<00:07:00.240> some<00:07:01.080> gold<00:07:01.520> but<00:07:02.520> these<00:07:02.790> coins<00:07:03.510> can

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
or maybe some gold but these coins can

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.110 
or maybe some gold but these coins can
change<00:07:04.710> in<00:07:05.190> the<00:07:05.390> blink<00:07:06.390> of<00:07:07.200> an<00:07:07.620> eye<00:07:08.120> into

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
change in the blink of an eye into

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.040 
change in the blink of an eye into
something<00:07:09.630> quite<00:07:10.050> strange<00:07:10.640> known<00:07:11.640> as<00:07:11.669> the

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
something quite strange known as the

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.570 
something quite strange known as the
coins<00:07:13.050> of<00:07:14.240> Shanghai<00:07:15.240> and<00:07:15.750> now<00:07:16.340> let's<00:07:17.340> simplify

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
coins of Shanghai and now let's simplify

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.180 
coins of Shanghai and now let's simplify
this<00:07:17.910> by<00:07:18.300> eliminating<00:07:19.110> the<00:07:19.320> pocket<00:07:19.710> I'll

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
this by eliminating the pocket I'll

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.930 
this by eliminating the pocket I'll
place<00:07:20.850> one<00:07:20.880> ball<00:07:21.419> in<00:07:22.290> my<00:07:22.470> left<00:07:22.680> hand<00:07:22.950> one<00:07:23.790> ball

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
place one ball in my left hand one ball

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.730 
place one ball in my left hand one ball
goes<00:07:24.330> in<00:07:24.510> the<00:07:24.720> right<00:07:24.840> hand<00:07:25.110> and<00:07:25.290> by<00:07:25.500> just

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
goes in the right hand and by just

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.010 
goes in the right hand and by just
tapping<00:07:25.950> like<00:07:26.310> this<00:07:26.580> two<00:07:27.240> balls<00:07:27.539> appear<00:07:27.960> in

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
tapping like this two balls appear in

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.690 
tapping like this two balls appear in
the<00:07:28.110> right<00:07:28.260> hand

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
the right hand

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.600 
the right hand
again<00:07:29.390> one<00:07:29.660> ball<00:07:29.690> in<00:07:30.140> each<00:07:30.230> hand<00:07:30.560> and<00:07:30.740> just<00:07:31.430> by

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
again one ball in each hand and just by

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.820 
again one ball in each hand and just by
tapping<00:07:32.210> like<00:07:32.570> this<00:07:32.810> we<00:07:33.050> now<00:07:33.170> have<00:07:33.380> two<00:07:33.560> balls

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830 
tapping like this we now have two balls

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.330 
tapping like this we now have two balls
in<00:07:34.100> the<00:07:34.880> left<00:07:35.120> hand
