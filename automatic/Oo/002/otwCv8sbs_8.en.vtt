that with the 5 players in the midfield

middle third of the field which some

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.229 
middle third of the field which some
would<00:00:36.710> argue<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.399> most<00:00:37.579> important<00:00:38.059> third

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
would argue is the most important third

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.450 
would argue is the most important third
of<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.420> field<00:00:38.630> in<00:00:38.960> terms<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.890> staging<00:00:40.340> and

of the field in terms of staging and
attack<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.170> providing<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.290> screening<00:00:42.800> front

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
for for defending the three backs

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.680 
for for defending the three backs
once<00:00:48.890> upon<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.190> time<00:00:49.309> could<00:00:49.879> be<00:00:50.030> played<00:00:50.270> as<00:00:50.480> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
once upon a time could be played as to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.229 
once upon a time could be played as to
marking<00:00:51.110> backs<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.590> sweeper<00:00:52.040> but<00:00:52.700> these

days<00:00:53.510> almost<00:00:54.110> no<00:00:54.320> one<00:00:54.469> does<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.739> it's<00:00:55.190> a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
days almost no one does that it's a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
for the system to be successful several

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.740 
for the system to be successful several
things<00:01:03.829> are<00:01:03.980> important<00:01:04.460> one<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.329> that<00:01:05.539> the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
things are important one is that the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.399 
things are important one is that the
roles<00:01:06.079> of<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.799> three<00:01:07.779> midfield<00:01:08.779> players<00:01:09.079> must

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
roles of the three midfield players must

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.309 
roles of the three midfield players must
be<00:01:09.619> clearly<00:01:09.920> defined<00:01:10.539> I've<00:01:11.539> used<00:01:11.929> the<00:01:12.079> system

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
be clearly defined I've used the system

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.469 
be clearly defined I've used the system
twice<00:01:12.529> in<00:01:13.009> my<00:01:13.130> coaching<00:01:13.399> career<00:01:13.729> once<00:01:14.209> very

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
twice in my coaching career once very

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.660 
twice in my coaching career once very
successfully<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.350> once<00:01:15.590> disastrously<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
successfully and once disastrously and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.260 
successfully and once disastrously and
the<00:01:17.179> critical<00:01:17.929> difference<00:01:18.109> was<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.249> when<00:01:20.119> we

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the critical difference was that when we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.669 
the critical difference was that when we
used<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.569> successfully<00:01:20.779> the<00:01:21.409> three

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
used it successfully the three

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.529 
used it successfully the three
midfielders<00:01:22.090> understood<00:01:23.090> their<00:01:23.270> roles

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
midfielders understood their roles

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.749 
midfielders understood their roles
brilliantly<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.409> like<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.219> coach<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.609> with<00:01:25.729> a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
brilliantly I like to coach it with a

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
play the system successfully you also

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.569 
play the system successfully you also
need<00:01:48.349> to<00:01:49.279> flank<00:01:50.209> midfielders<00:01:50.840> who<00:01:51.829> can<00:01:52.189> run

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
need to flank midfielders who can run

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.269 
need to flank midfielders who can run
the<00:01:52.759> field<00:01:53.029> who<00:01:53.749> can<00:01:54.380> get<00:01:54.619> forward<00:01:54.979> into<00:01:55.189> the

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
the field who can get forward into the

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.489 
the field who can get forward into the
attack<00:01:55.639> who<00:01:56.299> are<00:01:56.419> excellent<00:01:56.810> crossers

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
attack who are excellent crossers

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.529 
attack who are excellent crossers
excellent<00:01:58.039> servers<00:01:58.429> of<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.639> ball<00:01:58.849> but<00:01:59.389> who

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
excellent servers of the ball but who

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.190 
excellent servers of the ball but who
also<00:01:59.749> can<00:02:00.229> get<00:02:00.380> back<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.270> defend<00:02:02.270> tenaciously

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
also can get back and defend tenaciously

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.709 
also can get back and defend tenaciously
so<00:02:03.499> they've<00:02:03.649> got<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.859> be<00:02:03.950> very<00:02:04.159> fit<00:02:04.429> players

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
so they've got to be very fit players

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.870 
so they've got to be very fit players
technically<00:02:05.719> very<00:02:05.959> sound<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:06.619> if<00:02:07.609> we're

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
could play in a variety of ways I used

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.880 
could play in a variety of ways I used
to<00:02:25.700> like<00:02:25.909> to<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.239> one<00:02:26.540> more<00:02:27.170> oriented<00:02:27.739> as<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to like to have one more oriented as a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.440 
to like to have one more oriented as a

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
would tend to play more one up and one

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.589 
would tend to play more one up and one

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
off the ball it is a is a difficult

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.550 
off the ball it is a is a difficult
system<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:46.060> play<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.359> directly<00:02:47.810> out<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.200> the

system to play in directly out of the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
back but you certainly can possess the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.740 
back but you certainly can possess the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
ball very well and move the ball in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.520 
ball very well and move the ball in
midfield<00:02:53.989> but<00:02:55.450> often<00:02:56.450> times<00:02:56.720> teams<00:02:57.140> will<00:02:57.379> have

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
midfield but often times teams will have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770 
midfield but often times teams will have
the<00:02:57.680> three<00:02:57.980> backs<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:59.209> very<00:02:59.420> clear
