currently have much of the original
earlier<00:01:47.970> work<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.420> aeronautics<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.680> done

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
earlier work in aeronautics was done

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.330 
earlier work in aeronautics was done
right<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> UK<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.130> always

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
right here in the UK so you have always

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.050 
right here in the UK so you have always
been<00:01:53.880> among<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> leaders<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.380> came<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
been among the leaders when it came to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.820 
been among the leaders when it came to
taking<00:01:57.060> things<00:01:57.420> from<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> unknown<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
taking things from the unknown and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.370 
taking things from the unknown and
making<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.340> known<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.020> UK

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
making them known and and I think the UK

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
making them known and and I think the UK
is<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> perfect<00:02:01.950> partner<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.580> try<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.820> venture

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is a perfect partner to try to venture
