00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and there beauty guys who speaking edson 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 real-life math channel silva 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.400
 bringing you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.980
 the resolution of the 1st qualification examination 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 da uerj 2016 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.960
 the math test that your number 25 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.910
 the question said so admit that order 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 of magnitude of a measure x is a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 base power 10 consequent year 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.519
 to 10 for eni-10 for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.490
 10 to the lower middle and borges 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 less than 10 to the animals and the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.930
 consider that the earthquake has released 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 an energy is in general Luis whose value 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 number is such that day at the base is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 equal to 15.3 order of magnitude of r 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 games here evaluate this person was good 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.090
 quite simple beauty was only you have 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.739
 A little calm to understand what 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 he means he relationship here O log 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 of base 10 is equal to 15.3 say that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.340
 You have to remember that the property 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.900
 of the logarithm reminds us that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.860
 air locke on base b is equal to and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.229
 means that the higher the little arrows and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 is equal to a certain then that one can 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:23.189
 that 10 to 15.3 is equal to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 It is then he wants to know the order of 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 greatness is I already know what is valle 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 15.3 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.799
 but if the former and serves raised to 3 to 10 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.439
 15.3 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.400
 how will I know which of these options is the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.610
 correct 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.350
 crew that can be taken to whom 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.299
 I know high 16 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.680
 how can I be sure it 's a definition 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.820
 that give you up 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 he put here a certain restriction 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.100
 He said how are you going to stay? 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.560
 So what do you have to have here? 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.649
 value x will be 10 for example 10 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.469
 raising to 15 what you will lose 10 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.700
 elevated to 15 in place of x if it is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:10.110
 greater than or equal to 10 to 15 less 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 of one-half or less than 10 to 15 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.970
 more means 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:22.500
 so you have 10 high 14.5 right there 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.819
 your x 10 will be raised to 15.5 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.569
 happens you will have x equal to 10 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 high jack 15 is exposed if the value 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 you have here you have between 10 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.099
 elevated 14 and 10 and elevated to 15 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.140
 as the value we found was 10 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.299
 increased to 15.3 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.470
 he is in this range soon you have 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.260
 10 high to 15 alternative b tranquil 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.930
 just so you have an idea of ​​how 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.650
 A table works if it were to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.159
 you get to the letter c should raise 16 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.530
 you would have to 10 and it will take 16 he goes 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:12.500
 be 10 raised to 16 - medium and 10 raised 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:16.260
 to 16 but a half or 10 to 15.5 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.639
 x10 high 16 and a half then silver 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.060
 this interval would have to be greater or 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.810
 equal to 15.5 and smaller than 16.5 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.099
 It's really reserved for those beauty. 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.329
 Quite simple, the question is why 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.669
 more that is a matter of logic was 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.549
 simple but that idea is to be a question 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.010
 to be simple to log in does not mean 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.930
 to be simple after all is not simple at all 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.849
 Beauty then hope you have 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.129
 I like it if you subscribe to the channel 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.729
 enjoy a video and see you around 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.729
 galley I went
