00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
I'll bet we will see if we have any

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.910 
I'll bet we will see if we have any
results<00:03:24.580> now<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.330> can<00:03:25.630> say<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.050> we<00:03:26.290> are<00:03:26.500> have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
results now I can say that we are have

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.920 
results now I can say that we are have
some<00:03:27.220> results<00:03:27.550> because<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.270> very<00:03:28.480> purple

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
some results because it's very purple

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.010 
some results because it's very purple
and<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:30.160> think<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:30.940> time<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.750> was

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
and I think this time this was

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.070 
and I think this time this was
successful<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:33.040> there<00:03:33.580> will<00:03:33.760> be<00:03:33.790> no<00:03:34.090> fail<00:03:34.540> so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
successful and there will be no fail so

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.050 
successful and there will be no fail so
we<00:03:35.670> will<00:03:36.670> see<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:38.290> will<00:03:38.530> be<00:03:38.860> pretty<00:03:39.459> or<00:03:39.760> not

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
we will see if it will be pretty or not

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.870 
we will see if it will be pretty or not
I<00:03:40.450> really<00:03:40.780> hope<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.470> will<00:03:41.680> buy<00:03:42.370> for<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.700> while
