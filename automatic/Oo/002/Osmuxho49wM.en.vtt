00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.270 
sphere will be the mystery did you get
the<00:01:01.699> code<00:01:01.940> there<00:01:02.749> is<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.989> codons<00:01:03.469> nearly

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the code there is the codons nearly

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.560 
the code there is the codons nearly
destroyed<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.730> code<00:01:05.089> there

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
destroyed the code there

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.840 
destroyed the code there
what<00:01:06.320> if<00:01:06.620> you<00:01:06.800> want<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.190> code<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.820> use

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
what if you want that code you can use

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.680 
what if you want that code you can use
that<00:01:08.680> for<00:01:09.680> free<00:01:10.159> rocks<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:10.940> is<00:01:11.120> gone<00:01:11.480> in

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
that for free rocks and it is gone in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.020 
that for free rocks and it is gone in
three<00:01:12.580> two<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.970> one<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.870> code<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.230> blonde

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
three two and one the code is blonde

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.110 
three two and one the code is blonde
lucky<00:01:17.030> eat<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> first<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.530> get<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:19.070> there<00:01:19.310> with

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
lucky eat the first to get in there with

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.260 
lucky eat the first to get in there with
that<00:01:20.330> code<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.950> let's<00:01:22.430> take<00:01:22.700> all<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:22.970> puppy

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270
