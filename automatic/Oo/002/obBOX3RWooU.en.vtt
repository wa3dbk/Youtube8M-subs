00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
recording actually at a resolution of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.310 
recording actually at a resolution of
720p<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.269> pretty<00:00:15.419> good<00:00:15.660> we've<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.170> 1

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
720p so it's pretty good we've got 1

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.590 
720p so it's pretty good we've got 1
point<00:00:16.350> 2<00:00:16.980> megapixels<00:00:17.580> camera<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.240> front

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
point 2 megapixels camera at the front

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
point 2 megapixels camera at the front
if<00:00:18.810> i'm<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.020> wrong<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:20.160> i'm<00:00:20.490> doing<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.060> video

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
if i'm not wrong so i'm doing this video

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.350 
if i'm not wrong so i'm doing this video
like<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> blogger<00:00:23.100> well<00:00:23.850> i<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
like a like a blogger well i think that

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.420 
like a like a blogger well i think that
if<00:00:24.540> people<00:00:24.750> use<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.350> front<00:00:25.800> facing<00:00:25.950> camera<00:00:26.400> for

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
if people use a front facing camera for

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
if people use a front facing camera for
video<00:00:26.760> mode<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.600> they<00:00:27.690> almost<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:28.230> we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
video mode I think they almost like we

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.179 
video mode I think they almost like we
use<00:00:28.620> for<00:00:29.430> bloggy<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.720> when<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:32.009> living

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
use for bloggy so when I'm in my living

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.349

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
room as you can see this a lot of lights

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.739 
room as you can see this a lot of lights
in<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.870> bag<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.949> I'm<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.429> to<00:00:38.460> walk<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
in a bag so I'm going to walk around and

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.720 
in a bag so I'm going to walk around and
test<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.260> whether<00:00:40.499> if<00:00:40.679> there's<00:00:40.890> any<00:00:41.159> image

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
test out whether if there's any image

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.569 
test out whether if there's any image
stabilization<00:00:42.179> or<00:00:42.929> video<00:00:43.800> stabilizer<00:00:44.249> for

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
stabilization or video stabilizer for

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.569 
stabilization or video stabilizer for
this<00:00:44.879> point<00:00:45.210> facing<00:00:45.420> camera<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this point facing camera so I'm going to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
this point facing camera so I'm going to
walk<00:00:47.760> around<00:00:47.909> I'm<00:00:48.449> not<00:00:48.569> walking<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
walk around I'm not walking at that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.169 
walk around I'm not walking at that

walking towards my teacher Miss which is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
walking towards my teacher Miss which is
pretty<00:00:53.519> duck<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.839> can<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pretty duck so you can actually see the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.579 
pretty duck so you can actually see the
amount<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> noise<00:00:56.449> produce<00:00:57.449> proof<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> front

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
amount of noise produce proof the front

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.619 
amount of noise produce proof the front
facing<00:00:58.889> camera<00:00:59.159> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.909> see<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.449> back

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
facing camera you can see from the back

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
facing camera you can see from the back
there's<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:01.229> a<00:01:01.260> pretty<00:01:01.889> large<00:01:02.579> mouth

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
there's actually a pretty large mouth

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.010 
there's actually a pretty large mouth
noise<00:01:03.389> at<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
noise at a bit so I don't think there is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
noise at a bit so I don't think there is
any<00:01:07.259> xmas<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.219> on<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.490> front<00:01:08.729> facing

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
any xmas and so on the front facing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
any xmas and so on the front facing
camera<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.630> won't<00:01:10.049> reduce<00:01:10.229> any<00:01:10.770> amount

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
camera so it won't reduce any amount

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730 
camera so it won't reduce any amount
minds<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.630> walking<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.350> living

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
