hey everyone welcome to another gear
blocks<00:00:03.629> update<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.380> time<00:00:04.589> I'll<00:00:04.740> be<00:00:04.770> talking

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
blocks update this time I'll be talking

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.519 
blocks update this time I'll be talking
about<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.400> new<00:00:05.520> spring<00:00:05.759> dampers<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> game

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
about the new spring dampers in the game

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.629 
about the new spring dampers in the game
the<00:00:07.529> spring<00:00:07.740> dampers<00:00:08.040> are<00:00:08.130> made<00:00:08.220> out<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.490> two

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the spring dampers are made out of two

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.370 
the spring dampers are made out of two
parts<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.750> fitted<00:00:09.990> together

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
parts that have to be fitted together

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.440 
parts that have to be fitted together
and<00:00:10.650> they<00:00:10.800> come<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.190> sizes<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.820> smaller<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and they come in two sizes a smaller and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
and they come in two sizes a smaller and
a<00:00:12.480> larger<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:17.550> spring<00:00:17.760> dampers<00:00:18.029> are

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
a larger you know the spring dampers are

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:18.980 
a larger you know the spring dampers are
attached<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> rest<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> your

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
attached to the rest of your

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
attached to the rest of your
construction<00:00:19.320> using<00:00:20.220> axles<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> axles

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
construction using axles and the axles

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.370 
construction using axles and the axles
can<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.880> attached<00:00:24.180> either<00:00:24.539> using<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> hinge<00:00:25.170> or

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
can be attached either using a hinge or

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.730 
can be attached either using a hinge or
a<00:00:25.470> rigid<00:00:25.800> attachment<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.080> parts<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a rigid attachment the two parts of the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.460 
a rigid attachment the two parts of the
spring<00:00:29.160> damper<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.699> attached<00:00:30.000> in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
spring damper can be attached in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.510 
spring damper can be attached in
different<00:00:31.470> orientations<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
different orientations like that so you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
different orientations like that so you
can<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> axles<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.390> 90<00:00:33.660> degrees<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.440> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
can have the axles at 90 degrees if you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.209 
can have the axles at 90 degrees if you
want<00:00:37.579> once<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.879> spring<00:00:39.360> damper<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.780> unfrozen

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
want once the spring damper is unfrozen

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
want once the spring damper is unfrozen
you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.489> it'll<00:00:41.730> extend<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> spring

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you can see it'll extend as the spring

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.130 
you can see it'll extend as the spring
pushes<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> two<00:00:43.950> parts<00:00:44.280> apart<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.270> that

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.240 

the<00:00:49.140> two<00:00:49.289> parts<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> spring<00:00:49.829> damper<00:00:49.950> Esha

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the two parts the spring damper Esha

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
the two parts the spring damper Esha
attached<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> midpoint<00:00:51.570> along<00:00:52.469> their

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
attached at the midpoint along their

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
attached at the midpoint along their
range<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.340> motion<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.059> case<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.989> can

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
range of motion so in this case it can

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
range of motion so in this case it can
move<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.500> unit<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.699> unit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
move one unit in that way and one unit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
move one unit in that way and one unit
out<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:58.879> there's<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> larger<00:01:00.359> spring

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
out that way there's a larger spring

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
out that way there's a larger spring
damper<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> greater<00:01:02.460> range<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
damper that has a greater range of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.200 
damper that has a greater range of
movement<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.309> case<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.790> move<00:01:05.939> two

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
movement so in this case it can move two

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.870 
movement so in this case it can move two
units<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.439> units<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:10.610> okay<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.670> let's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
units in and two units out okay so let's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480 
units in and two units out okay so let's
have<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> look<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.590> parts<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.189> couple

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
have a look at these parts on a couple

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
have a look at these parts on a couple
of<00:01:14.549> examples<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.330> off<00:01:15.479> here's<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> simple

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
of examples so first off here's a simple

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
of examples so first off here's a simple
test<00:01:16.619> bed<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> swing<00:01:17.520> arm<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> weight

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
test bed with a swing arm and a weight

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
test bed with a swing arm and a weight
that<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.290> compress<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that we're going to use to compress the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:30.410 
that we're going to use to compress the
spring<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.060> attach<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:29.420> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
spring so let's attach that like that so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.999 
spring so let's attach that like that so
once<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.869> frozen<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> spring

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
once I'm frozen you can see the spring

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.270 
once I'm frozen you can see the spring
is<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.220> pushing<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> arm<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:35.070> under

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is now pushing the arm up and it's under

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
is now pushing the arm up and it's under
compression<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> weight<00:01:36.119> pulling<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
compression from the weight pulling it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.740 
compression from the weight pulling it
down<00:01:37.460> now<00:01:38.460> by<00:01:38.790> hovering<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.509> spring

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
down now by hovering over the spring

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.160 
down now by hovering over the spring
damper<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.200> holding<00:01:41.130> shift<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> E<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:43.140> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
damper and holding shift and E you can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
damper and holding shift and E you can
bring<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.070> part<00:01:44.520> behavior<00:01:44.880> dialog<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
bring up the part behavior dialog and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
bring up the part behavior dialog and
adjust<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> spring<00:01:46.770> rate<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.100> damping<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.119> if

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
adjust the spring rate and damping so if

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
adjust the spring rate and damping so if
I<00:01:48.270> bring<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> spring<00:01:48.780> rate<00:01:48.930> down<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> see

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I bring the spring rate down you can see

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
I bring the spring rate down you can see
that<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> arm<00:01:50.970> sinks<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.810> there's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that the arm sinks down because there's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.679 
that the arm sinks down because there's
less<00:01:52.049> force<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> spring<00:01:52.770> pushing<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> up

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
less force in the spring pushing it up

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.709 
less force in the spring pushing it up
and<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.219> increase<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.000> make<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and I can increase it as well to make it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
and I can increase it as well to make it
more<00:01:57.960> stiffly<00:01:58.290> sprung<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:59.340> well<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:01.740> adjust

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
more stiffly sprung as well I can adjust

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
more stiffly sprung as well I can adjust
the<00:02:02.159> damping<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.119> bring<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the damping so if I bring that all the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.080 
the damping so if I bring that all the
way<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.500> becomes<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.909> very

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
way down you can see becomes very very

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.120 
way down you can see becomes very very
bouncy

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.320 

and<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:11.030> push<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.080> way<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> see

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and I can push it all the way up you see

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.620 
and I can push it all the way up you see
the<00:02:14.450> motor<00:02:14.660> movements<00:02:15.110> now<00:02:15.590> very<00:02:15.860> stiff<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
the motor movements now very stiff and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.010 
the motor movements now very stiff and
actually<00:02:17.830> when<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:19.010> released<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:20.240> takes<00:02:20.840> a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
actually when it's released it takes a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.390 
actually when it's released it takes a
little<00:02:21.140> time<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.440> be<00:02:21.770> pushed<00:02:22.069> up<00:02:22.190> by<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
little time to be pushed up by the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.949 
little time to be pushed up by the
spring<00:02:22.700> because<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.000> damping<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.510> kind<00:02:23.930> of

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
spring because the damping is kind of

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.729 
spring because the damping is kind of
holding<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.319> back<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:27.290> largest<00:02:27.620> spring

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
holding it back the largest spring

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.160 
holding it back the largest spring
damper<00:02:27.950> not<00:02:28.250> only<00:02:28.459> has<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.720> greater<00:02:29.720> range<00:02:29.989> of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
damper not only has a greater range of

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.460 
damper not only has a greater range of
movement<00:02:30.319> but<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.130> also<00:02:31.280> has<00:02:32.020> higher<00:02:33.020> spring

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
movement but it also has higher spring

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.320 
movement but it also has higher spring
and<00:02:33.739> damping<00:02:34.100> rates<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.790> starts<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.209> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and damping rates so it starts at a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.800 
and damping rates so it starts at a
higher<00:02:35.870> default<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.830> go<00:02:36.980> up<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:38.480> twice

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
higher default and can go up to twice

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.140 
higher default and can go up to twice
the<00:02:39.020> values<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.739> smaller<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the values that the smaller one can and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.800 
the values that the smaller one can and
one<00:02:44.269> last<00:02:44.450> thing<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.720> mention<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
one last thing to mention is that the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
one last thing to mention is that the
spring<00:02:47.810> rate<00:02:47.959> can<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.230> reduced<00:02:48.530> all<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> way

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
spring rate can be reduced all the way

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.410 
spring rate can be reduced all the way
down<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.130> zero<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.760> then<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> spring<00:02:50.269> damper

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
down to zero and then the spring damper

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.250 
down to zero and then the spring damper
becomes<00:02:50.900> just<00:02:51.230> purely<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.650> damper<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.140> can

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
becomes just purely a damper so you can

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.630 
becomes just purely a damper so you can
see<00:02:54.350> there's<00:02:54.500> no<00:02:54.590> spring<00:02:54.800> force<00:02:55.100> anymore<00:02:55.310> but

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
see there's no spring force anymore but

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.479 
see there's no spring force anymore but
it<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.880> lets<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.390> weight<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:57.080> gently<00:03:00.489> okay

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
it just lets the weight down gently okay

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.220 
it just lets the weight down gently okay
so<00:03:01.550> let's<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.000> look<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.569> simple

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
so let's have a look at this on a simple

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.259 
so let's have a look at this on a simple
vehicle<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:07.880> we<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:10.280> couple<00:03:11.090> of

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
vehicle so here we have a couple of

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.539 
vehicle so here we have a couple of
uprights<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.170> move<00:03:12.739> up<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.010> down<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.430> are

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
uprights that move up and down that are

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.479 
uprights that move up and down that are
attached<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.450> chassis<00:03:14.630> with<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:16.250> swing

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
attached to the chassis with these swing

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.330 
attached to the chassis with these swing
arms<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.000> let<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> suspension<00:03:18.980> move<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.250> and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
arms that let the suspension move up and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.210 
arms that let the suspension move up and
down<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.650> spring<00:03:21.650> damper<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.950> attached

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
down and the spring damper is attached

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.690 
down and the spring damper is attached
rigidly

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
rigidly

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.030 
rigidly
to<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.480> rest<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.989> upright<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.829> stop

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
to the rest of the upright to stop

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.100 
to the rest of the upright to stop
things<00:03:25.579> flopping<00:03:25.940> around<00:03:26.030> I've<00:03:26.959> just

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
things flopping around I've just

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.930 
things flopping around I've just
implemented<00:03:27.650> steering<00:03:28.100> using<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.610> couple<00:03:28.820> of

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
implemented steering using a couple of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.580 
implemented steering using a couple of
servos<00:03:29.329> like<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:29.930> just<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.320> keep<00:03:30.440> things

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
servos like this just to keep things

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.370 
servos like this just to keep things
simple<00:03:30.799> otherwise<00:03:31.250> you'd<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.640> bunch<00:03:32.000> of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
simple otherwise you'd have a bunch of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.860 
simple otherwise you'd have a bunch of
linkages<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.650> stuff<00:03:33.920> as<00:03:34.040> well<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.570> want

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
linkages and stuff as well I just want

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.720 
linkages and stuff as well I just want
to<00:03:35.930> keep<00:03:35.989> things<00:03:36.200> simple<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:37.070> example

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to keep things simple this this example

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.750 
to keep things simple this this example
the<00:03:38.450> rear<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.310> solid<00:03:40.310> swing<00:03:41.150> arm

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
the rear we just have a solid swing arm

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.039 
the rear we just have a solid swing arm
pretty<00:03:43.760> much<00:03:43.940> as<00:03:44.329> simple<00:03:44.540> as<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.810> can<00:03:44.840> get

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
pretty much as simple as you can get

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.729 
pretty much as simple as you can get
really<00:03:47.079> but<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.290> see<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.500> works<00:03:48.620> pretty

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
really but you can see it works pretty

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.710 
really but you can see it works pretty
well<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:49.579> see<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.970> vehicle<00:03:52.720> riding

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
well and you can see the vehicle riding

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.940 
well and you can see the vehicle riding
on<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:53.989> suspension<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.680> kind<00:03:54.890> of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
on the suspension and kind of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.319 
on the suspension and kind of
compressing<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.850> down<00:03:55.970> like<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:58.180> now<00:03:59.180> when

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
compressing it down like that now when

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.880 
compressing it down like that now when
you're<00:03:59.450> adjusting<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.900> suspension<00:04:00.410> for<00:04:00.769> your

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
you're adjusting the suspension for your

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.520 
you're adjusting the suspension for your
vehicle<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.970> typically<00:04:02.359> want<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:03.049> have<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
vehicle you typically want to have the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.289 
vehicle you typically want to have the
the<00:04:06.920> suspension<00:04:07.400> give<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.760> kind<00:04:07.970> of<00:04:08.030> one

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
the suspension give you a kind of one

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.500 
the suspension give you a kind of one
down<00:04:08.900> up<00:04:09.140> motion<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:10.150> kind<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.239> what<00:04:11.359> you're

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
down up motion is kind of what you're

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.910 
down up motion is kind of what you're
after<00:04:11.630> rather<00:04:12.019> than<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.230> bouncing<00:04:12.650> around<00:04:12.709> all

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
after rather than it bouncing around all

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.210 
after rather than it bouncing around all
over<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.190> place<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.870> also<00:04:15.220> typically

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
over the place and you also typically

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.860 
over the place and you also typically
want<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.609> have<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.909> spring<00:04:17.239> rate<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.570> damping

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
want to have the spring rate and damping

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.560 
want to have the spring rate and damping
at<00:04:17.959> roughly<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.320> same<00:04:18.500> value<00:04:18.890> seems<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.280> give

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
at roughly the same value seems to give

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.300 
at roughly the same value seems to give
good<00:04:20.810> behavior<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.800> know<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.220> play

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
good behavior but you know you can play

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.600 
good behavior but you know you can play
around<00:04:22.490> with<00:04:22.670> it<00:04:22.850> as<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.420> want<00:04:27.130> as<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.190> say<00:04:28.430> this

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
around with it as you want as I say this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.440 
around with it as you want as I say this
is<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.760> very<00:04:29.000> simple<00:04:30.700> suspension<00:04:31.700> geometry<00:04:31.820> you

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
is a very simple suspension geometry you

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.500 
is a very simple suspension geometry you
can<00:04:32.620> build<00:04:33.620> all<00:04:33.860> sorts<00:04:33.890> of<00:04:34.130> kind<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.520> different

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
can build all sorts of kind of different

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.980 
can build all sorts of kind of different
kinds<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.840> suspension<00:04:37.450> yeah<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.600> can't<00:04:38.840> say

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
kinds of suspension yeah and I can't say

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.090 
kinds of suspension yeah and I can't say
weights<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.380> what<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.530> guys<00:04:39.650> build<00:04:39.950> with

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
weights to what you guys build with

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.430 
weights to what you guys build with
these<00:04:40.220> new<00:04:40.370> parts<00:04:40.700> but<00:04:41.690> yeah<00:04:41.780> that's<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.260> for

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
these new parts but yeah that's it for

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.970 
these new parts but yeah that's it for
this<00:04:42.530> time<00:04:42.820> thanks<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:43.850> watching
