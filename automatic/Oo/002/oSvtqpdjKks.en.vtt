00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
 a ball to start his death 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.889
 in agreement 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.150
 what you have to do from the position of prepared your state of the question 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:07.930
 of prepared 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 is that the ball well to the right the doctor what you do is to prepare 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.219
 a blow right away 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.139
 looking at rum is weird 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.119
 7 if the amazing already have the racket almost here without having to shoot 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 only need they will not do anything now only zp 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.849
 it's just to throw 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.210
 only me with this little twist 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.640
 I'm almost ready 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.879
 from here again to find distances 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.330
 then p the racket back 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.230
 hit where he was before 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 and continued forward 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.730
 and ended up going back 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.950
 in the direction where I want to throw the ball 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.480
 that agreement 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.510
 now it would be 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.120
 now it would be more or less 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.480
 move more 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 percent 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.290
 It has to be natural 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
 Egypt 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.610
 efe of agreement podés in this same year 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.020
 said contribution currently has a 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 in this way on your part 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.120
 yes well done 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.770
 expectant attitude 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 Madrid 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.990
 now 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.830
 canalize 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.219
 the cock that song explained 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.219
 very good now 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.840
 I do these exercises and that nobody can incur the students that I 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.000
 throw hand because it's the only way 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.490
 that they can control the ball, feel it first and foremost 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.690
 in any Cáceres tennis teacher that the student 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.870
 he will have to control the ball accordingly then if he does not feel the ball 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.720
 it is impossible that later I can learn to play a network that does not have a technique 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.810
 correct is much faster if he can hit very slowly because 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.920
 can feel that what happens then remember the first feel the ball already 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.840
 Then you have to feel the body then once we have the technique 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.190
 with how the racket moves you have to learn to do it by moving your feet 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.739
 Same time
