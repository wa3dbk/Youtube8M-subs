00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
farm side the second thing we did is we

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.459

reworked<00:00:47.980> severs<00:00:48.399> w<00:00:48.910> ricochet<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:50.140> instead

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
reworked severs w ricochet now instead

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.959

each<00:00:52.120> attack<00:00:52.449> is<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.840> non<00:00:53.109> next<00:00:53.469> hit<00:00:53.590> effect

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
each attack is a non next hit effect

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.340 
each attack is a non next hit effect
like<00:00:54.039> NASA's<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.699> siphon<00:00:55.149> e<00:00:55.210> strike<00:00:55.570> this<00:00:56.170> will

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
like NASA's a siphon e strike this will

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.380 
like NASA's a siphon e strike this will
let<00:00:56.500> her<00:00:56.680> do<00:00:56.920> kind<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.579> double<00:00:57.879> attack<00:00:58.120> thing

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
let her do kind of a double attack thing

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.939 
let her do kind of a double attack thing
like<00:00:58.539> we<00:00:58.690> see<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.050> other<00:00:59.260> on<00:00:59.500> next<00:00:59.859> hit

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
like we see with other on next hit

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.740 
like we see with other on next hit
effects<00:01:00.280> which<00:01:00.699> improves<00:01:01.239> their<00:01:01.359> ability<00:01:01.719> to

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
effects which improves their ability to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.299 
effects which improves their ability to
skirmish<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.469> kind<00:01:02.649> of<00:01:02.710> play<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> lane

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
skirmish and kind of play in the lane

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.120 
skirmish and kind of play in the lane
when<00:01:03.760> there's<00:01:03.910> fewer<00:01:04.210> than<00:01:04.390> five<00:01:04.600> targets

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
when there's fewer than five targets

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.590 
when there's fewer than five targets
finally<00:01:06.130> we've<00:01:06.250> changed<00:01:06.490> servers<00:01:06.790> passive<00:01:07.390> as

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
finally we've changed servers passive as

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.750 
finally we've changed servers passive as
opposed<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.440> giving<00:01:08.590> dodge<00:01:08.920> while<00:01:09.160> moving<00:01:09.430> it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
opposed to giving dodge while moving it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.429 
opposed to giving dodge while moving it
now<00:01:10.030> gives<00:01:10.330> bonus<00:01:10.750> move<00:01:10.960> speed<00:01:11.200> when<00:01:11.350> you

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
now gives bonus move speed when you

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.499 
now gives bonus move speed when you
attack<00:01:11.680> an<00:01:11.799> enemy<00:01:11.860> champion<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:13.240> allows

you can really feel like you made the
right<00:03:19.840> choice<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.310> some<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
right choice because of some of the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.580 
right choice because of some of the
jungle<00:03:21.820> changes<00:03:22.240> we<00:03:22.330> did<00:03:22.510> health<00:03:23.110> potions<00:03:23.470> are

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
jungle changes we did health potions are

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.229 
jungle changes we did health potions are
much<00:03:23.620> less<00:03:24.130> required<00:03:24.489> for<00:03:24.700> junglers<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.150> be

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
much less required for junglers to be

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.820 
much less required for junglers to be
successful<00:03:25.750> there<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.050> we<00:03:26.170> felt<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:26.530> had<00:03:26.560> some

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
successful there so we felt we had some

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.870 
successful there so we felt we had some
room<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.070> go<00:03:27.280> ahead<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.519> adjust<00:03:27.700> these

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
room to go ahead and adjust these

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.820 
room to go ahead and adjust these
numbers<00:03:28.239> now<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:29.019> reason<00:03:29.260> we<00:03:29.350> wanted<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> do

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
numbers now the reason we wanted to do

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.830 
numbers now the reason we wanted to do

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
so was people were being a little too

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.690 
so was people were being a little too
