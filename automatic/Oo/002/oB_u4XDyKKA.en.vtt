don't have the real one unfortunately so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.970 
don't have the real one unfortunately so
that's<00:00:51.989> part<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> reason<00:00:52.620> why<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> made<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that's part of the reason why I made a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.520 
that's part of the reason why I made a
custom<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.579> normally<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.120> would<00:00:54.270> have

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
custom one normally I would have

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.720 
custom one normally I would have
minifigure<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> lot<00:00:55.710> closer<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
minifigure a lot closer so I use this in

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.029 
minifigure a lot closer so I use this in
a<00:00:56.789> Jago<00:00:57.090> piece<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> shoulder<00:00:59.160> piece

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
a Jago piece here for a shoulder piece

give him a red cape and a suit from the
old<00:01:05.790> spider-man<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.409> built<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.920> his

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
old spider-man and then I built on his

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
old spider-man and then I built on his
hat<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:12.030> try<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:12.990> best<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
hat here as you can see I try my best to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
hat here as you can see I try my best to
make<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.100> accurate<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.700> possible<00:01:15.470> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
make it look as accurate as possible and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.999 
make it look as accurate as possible and
also<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.220> terms<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> proportion<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
also in terms of proportion I think it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460 
also in terms of proportion I think it
it<00:01:20.460> turned<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:20.850> fine<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:22.320> eyes
