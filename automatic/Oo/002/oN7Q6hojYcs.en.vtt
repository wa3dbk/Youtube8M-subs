00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pretty serious this repair will be a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.930 
pretty serious this repair will be a
race<00:00:53.550> against<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> clock<00:00:55.070> first<00:00:56.070> job<00:00:56.370> get

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
race against the clock first job get

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.599 
race against the clock first job get
supplies<00:00:58.850> second<00:00:59.850> job<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> water<00:01:01.020> out

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
supplies second job get the water out

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
supplies second job get the water out
and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.120> safely<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.080> I'm

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and I can pretty safely say that I'm

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
and I can pretty safely say that I'm
definitely<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:05.970> person<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.510> bail<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
definitely the first person to bail this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.469 
definitely the first person to bail this
boat<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:08.700> sure<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> won't<00:01:09.330> be

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
boat out but I'm pretty sure I won't be

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
boat out but I'm pretty sure I won't be
the<00:01:09.720> last

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the last

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.219 
the last
this<00:01:11.250> water<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.729> cold

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.050 

things<00:01:20.229> are<00:01:20.380> never<00:01:20.500> easy<00:01:20.649> on<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.219> trip<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:21.939> we

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
things are never easy on this trip so we

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.499 
things are never easy on this trip so we
have<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.360> work<00:01:22.539> fast<00:01:24.000> being<00:01:25.000> sunny<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:25.479> the

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
have to work fast being sunny for the

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.709 
have to work fast being sunny for the
last<00:01:25.719> six<00:01:25.990> hours<00:01:26.200> but<00:01:26.530> we've<00:01:26.649> taken<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.250> long

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
last six hours but we've taken so long

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.950 
last six hours but we've taken so long
these<00:01:28.719> clouds<00:01:29.049> are<00:01:29.229> starting<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.710> roll<00:01:29.890> in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
these clouds are starting to roll in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.190 
these clouds are starting to roll in
maybe<00:01:31.960> 10<00:01:32.229> 15<00:01:32.619> minutes<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:34.420> what<00:01:34.539> happens

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.639 

this<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.259> exactly<00:01:42.420> exactly<00:01:43.420> how<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.170> fit<00:01:44.500> how

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
this is exactly exactly how we fit how

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.480 
this is exactly exactly how we fit how
to<00:01:44.710> fix<00:01:44.979> sails

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
to fix sails

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.609 
to fix sails
I<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:49.479> we've<00:01:49.599> done<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.780> pretty<00:01:49.869> nice<00:01:50.259> job

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619
