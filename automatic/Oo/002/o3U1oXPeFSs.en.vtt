00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.559
 welcome aboard the strong galaxy a 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.240
 monospace we can say it is almost 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.570
 one of the last survivors of this 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.390
 segment 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.460
 and yes this one does not present itself as a 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.060
 crossover or a mix of I do not know 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.880
 What is true you talk about the renault 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.140
 space not specially way I have not 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.669
 tried the renault space in front of a 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.599
 confidence so I will not allow myself to 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.009
 make space renault reviews 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.200
 games it's justin theroux back 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.430
 guidelines and he is ready ligÃ©a I say 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.689
 that because indeed the renault 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.840
 space that was almost the same 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.039
 minivan symbol now the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 French manufacturer presents it as 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.359
 a crossover but that's for that yes but no 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.039
 sir you may notice too 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.620
 something weird is that I 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.660
 am right it's normal we're in 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.440
 england but it's the very first and 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.899
 that of galaxy on it is an excluded if we 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.269
 wants the Parisian or motorcycle if I 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.129
 quickdraw before we'll see I think everything 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.519
 is an hour before it happened the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.440
 weekend finally in any case yes we are 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.909
 all first to try it and try it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 in England it's good because the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.520
 roads are demanding 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.410
 so if a vehicle behaves of course 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.550
 the English roads is that it's good 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.910
 after on our roads 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.560
 the minivans it's space is here 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.110
 this is the case so we have three rows 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.140
 seven seats it serves and slash yeah they 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.399
 have put an easy access system to 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.180
 the back yeah because there is no 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.850
 sliding doors 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.439
 oddly sliding doors on 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.610
 problem is that it's heavy and that 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.590
 expensive and today as we 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.080
 looking to win co2 it's the race 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.470
 it's on the back and my weight looks good 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.759
 practice if we still have a 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.289
 wide range of engines 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.659
 in any case in diesel passes that has not 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.679
 of gas it goes from 100 cows calves have 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.539
 210 horses 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.479
 yeah it's still the same block it's 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.100
 a 2 liters tdci turbo or bi turbo on 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.659
 the high end and every time it's 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.340
 finally the same block of 4 cylinders 2 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.549
 liters of water that is declined in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.349
 different yeah so she 120 150 180 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.299
 and 210 there we have with the 180 but hey there 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.429
 is that's what they do ah yeah you 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.780
 find the 50 years the straw series q you 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.280
 think he's a little bit right me it has to 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.290
 to be equivalent couple 1 there must not be 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.549
 have lemon horses on a diesel 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.290
 it is especially the couple who is 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.299
 important so it must appear 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 really very very good but hey it's 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.620
 well what 180 all his accounts with the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.569
 kids behind the luggage and everything 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.049
 was not too much that we launched not too much 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.049
 there is also a phenomenon of more 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.689
 in addition frequent piloted suspension 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.639
 appears here as an option 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.400
 his appearance then there is no one on 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.560
 this one yeah I think no no I have 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.939
 not seen either it's still 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.659
 quite comfortable finally just now 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.549
 I was in the back 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.680
 it was still a little more hectic 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.389
 at waimes is pretty normal from the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.579
 world on a minivan you have seats 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.639
 modular that flip full soon 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.109
 that they do not necessarily withdraw less 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 thick than standard seats but 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.599
 less heavy worry yeah actually to 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.980
 the back a comfort 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.109
 Then you come there did practice 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 it's a choice but good as it is 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.349
 often children in the back who are 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.840
 less demanding even in seats 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.150
 self they take the party to make 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.909
 seats plus background but more practical 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.129
 the Iceland of plowing then the minivan 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.209
 is also a loading capacity there 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.719
 in 7-seater version 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.250
 we have 300 liters which is good it is the 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.139
 chest of a big animated site we are in 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.799
 7th place a home then 300 liters is 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.599
 to the roof 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.599
 it's because it's so it's less 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.699
 it must be 250 maybe but 700 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.569
 liters in 5-seater version with the 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.659
 rear seats 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.109
 folded is not bad it's good in 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.069
 the more seats are sliding 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.930
 bows 5 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.719
 yeah these are really three seats 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.849
 independent you can put three seats 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.319
 auto on the back that's very important 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.000
 for large families it's 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.310
 you have three places but the place 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.780
 central is a false place then 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.780
 that there you have a real seat in the middle 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.950
 remains the question of the tariffs months are 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 almost copied on the competition have 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.260
 now it's after you 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.169
 compare the equipment there the tariff of 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.359
 base starts at 37000 goes to 37000 without 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.340
 joy for the trend version with the 100 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.739
 calf cows and we have more than 44 minutes 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.370
 with a 180 with a double box 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.630
 powershift clutch 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.880
 there is also a version 4 4 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.479
 yes we can have it in 4 4 6 2 million 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.800
 euros + it is rather a 4 4 on a 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.090
 sequence enough years and it goes mostly 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.490
 allow all the texts that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.050
 work in mountain adopt me as 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.190
 that rather than in 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.349
 false traction with enhanced traction 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.729
 finally is the MPV it's 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:44.349
 really it's not segment that is lost 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.159
 yeah what's her guard anyway 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.720
 an interest me I think his guard in 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.940
 interest since 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.660
 from the moment you need 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.950
 space tab to 3 be the look does not matter 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.690
 what is needed is to put the luggage 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.040
 and the kids so I mean there is a 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.760
 moment when you have a cubic form 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.610
 etc. 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.990
 it may sound like a military yes 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.190
 maybe but well here I was 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.780
 a lot of people who need a 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 everyday utility and then there the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.530
 difference of a utility you have when 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.960
 even a level of comfort and even in 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.910
 driving pleasure that's still 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.130
 not bad against the box the direction the 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.530
 chassis is still not bad 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.040
 you do not feel like a van 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.200
 now it's true it's a movie 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.000
 in super new wolf at the level of 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.520
 look it was very well stitched but 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.170
 do you lose in aesthetics that he 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.010
 wins a practical side with a beautiful 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.210
 roof guard etc 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.890
 so it's a choice one that is 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.810
 attached to appearances prefers a 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:41.410
 silac crossover to the kids 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.510
 four kids there is the obligatory passage 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.800
 here he will always do anyway 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.150
 more space than in a big 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.690
 7 pass crossovers it will cost a lot 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.690
 more expensive 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.560
 and then in the end we 'll even be a little 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.560
 more because it will be higher
