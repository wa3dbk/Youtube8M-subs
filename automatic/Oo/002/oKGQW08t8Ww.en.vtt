00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.429
 saturated 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.800
 today we have 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.480
 unon boxing 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 palm 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.009
 perforator 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.869
 firms bosch 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 which is called 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.169
 jay bi yo ichi 2 23 er riyade aut 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 it comes in such 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.190
 huge boxes even short call 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.990
 hard case 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.170
 blue like all professional 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.250
 models 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.060
 firm 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.720
 bush 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.630
 this is not a case in cairo boxing 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.020
 accordingly it cannot be joined 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.040
 with other cases 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.450
 unique individual 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.380
 the size 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.580
 therefore it is used only 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.210
 individually 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.080
 we look at 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.780
 with others earlier the other day 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.190
 which is not easy 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.039
 in the wagon what I saw 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.830
 glass moisture 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260
 all morning losses 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.530
 heavy even with one hand is quite difficult 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.740
 to run 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.900
 on this side 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.870
 sticker 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.060
 they have small specifications 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.980
 written that made 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.380
 china punch 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 written in different languages 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.650
 I think we have written here that 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 the drug has already been extinguished from various 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.190
 language courses 0 most pictures 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 second we will learn the play that 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.550
 power consumption perforator 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.390
 710 here 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.200
 apparently my maximum 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.460
 drilling diameter 23 millimeter 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.950
 and in that you can use 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.330
 transaero 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 any 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 the most simple com usd with plus 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.279
 on the opposite end 0 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.279
 and see only the name 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 but also that to the regimes of cats 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.260
 so bed 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
 for this you need and what is the key 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.109
 so do not latch 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.709
 and understand 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.909
 top cover 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.499
 Yes, as we see the equipment inside 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.619
 not too rich 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 lies in pakistan puncher 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:47.780
 fork 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.209
 there is no land 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 powerful at 220 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.779
 but the end is 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.129
 when rubber stuff 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.379
 hard to say anything she is possible somewhere 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.749
 what were like 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:05.849
 insert 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.849
 pull out of the socket 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 immediately soak 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.679
 besides the boxes we see 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.439
 we get 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.639
 one two three four 5 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.679
 replaceable 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:29.969
 rings 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.969
 for complex rsa but in this we will tell a little 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.319
 pick up the punch itself 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.189
 quite heavy 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.519
 probably kilos 2 3 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.669
 perforator consists of two parts 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.689
 proper 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.689
 herself 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.309
 vacuum cleaners unit 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:57.909
 someone to disconnect 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.629
 vacuum cleaner need 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.699
 push button crit button 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.699
 all night before but not so easy 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.379
 it means kohl sos 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.139
 contains filter at the bottom 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.329
 then to remove the doctor we press 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.199
 we understand 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.199
 here the filtering parts are removable 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.340
 all look at the forums write that she 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.220
 either washable toli blown in general 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.249
 this move pretty 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.539
 long time 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.210
 into place 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.509
 true square it is not very tight 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 I generally have such rubble that 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.460
 tightness is full of some window practice 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.400
 shows no 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.939
 in sussex good enough 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.889
 we collect into place 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.249
 in the same way as disassembled the daughter 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.009
 Chicago 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.180
 we all puncher 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.279
 ready for work 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.659
 not enough on the right 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.249
 correct electricity 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.249
 we connect 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.889
 and try to turn on 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.939
 dumk work of the punch 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.680
 population now 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 Craig will not 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.089
 see the work tripoli sos can 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.210
 for example, this is us 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.539
 take a look at a regular piece of paper 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.029
 can he him 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.029
 to hold 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.660
 power gcal thawed at least in order 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.660
 to hold a piece of paper 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:02.789
 let's see now 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.409
 perforator housing 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.159
 what kind of governing body do we have 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.389
 but this is the most important thing 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.710
 descend trailer 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.710
 stabbing which trigger flow 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.909
 the rules of the fingers 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.580
 thumb there is an mbp fix button 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.710
 pressed 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.500
 released he continues to work 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.500
 pressing started reading 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.900
 from two sides 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.059
 switch 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.059
 forward and reverse 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.599
 target side 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.650
 there is a drilling switch slotting 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.650
 In fact that in the asset you need to click 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.209
 the button is pretty to have it all 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.009
 happens and crank into another 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.290
 side just need to press 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.409
 but the button 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.559
 crank up 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.329
 I already told you about the handle 

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:04.809
 rental opening to 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.099
 move 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.669
 from place 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.809
 all of this country 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.899
 other controls no but 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.069
 there is 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.490
 ticket points on which 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.529
 is written 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.080
 allowable size 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.469
 draw 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.469
 materials 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.369
 replacement of the drill 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:28.050
 happens 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.599
 corporatization 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:31.559
 to myself 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:32.770
 cartridges 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.020
 but accordingly 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.180
 drawing up there 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.699
 google maps shank it 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:39.740
 sds 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.740
 a plus 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:48.129
 vacuum cleaner to pieces 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.169
 can move 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.520
 drilling in order accordingly 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.699
 when drilling 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.699
 nbu could go deep into the wall 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.179
 efficiency 

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:02.339
 dust collection 

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.909
 do not interfere 

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:07.909
 that's probably all but he is 

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:11.380
 the bush 

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.389
 jay forever up to 23 m
