 movement and system of celebrations in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.509
 which we get a menu at the moment of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 rotate with different buttons which 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.980
 we have to press for our 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 player do an acceleration that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 we breathe the most 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.420
 represent at the time of the game and so 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 becomes much more realistic in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 this situation 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.269
 without further ado and we express with the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.830

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.270
 player holding process 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 with the square with the triangle or the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.539
 Full observation 1 and the assignment 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 complicated have to understand 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.820
 first tica player in specific 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.710
 has its holding an acceleration 2 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.899
 by default and to enjoy it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.850
 they simply have to address square 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.290
 in play and always 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.180
 11 of the jazz tortilla 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.070
 predetermined front case study by 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 example squeezed with acceleration 1 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.630
 has the celebration of the self and the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.909
 default movements could only 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.590
 modify until here he was finished and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.450
 in the edit section we can 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.759
 nail it to each player as we want 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.799
 now if we go to the series of 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.509
 celebrations that can do it all 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.950
 player type first the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.500
 jumping celebrations that simply 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.409
 squeezed triangle as many times as we want 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.430
 and players in the fifth jump sure you 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.430
 It puts this convenient 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.820
 we also have the celebration of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 movement of hands and movement of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.650
 arms we support squares again and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.310
 we look and the player will make different 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.280
 movements 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.460
 we can also go to the public 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.470
 and enter an animation in the game and 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.329
 that we will celebrate with our classmates 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.329
 accompanied by public fund 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 you can also happen behind the arch and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 spend thus celebrating for later 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.860
 meet again for our companions 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.590
 undoubtedly one of the best 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.780
 celebrations that I have introduced has been 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 the run towards the band and since it has 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.470
 a lot of variants and they are very but 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.470
 very entertaining 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 Last but not least I have 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.910
 said also quite diversity and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.650
 we could cover towards the cameras by 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.900
 the journalists simply to the state 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.750
 of the pennant can be in both bands 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.490
 and we will celebrate looking at a camera with the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.370
 company of other colleagues really 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.720
 it's a super good animation and it's very 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 but very well made
