creep<00:02:20.800> into<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> calculation<00:02:21.940> let<00:02:22.150> me

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
creep into the calculation let me

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.510 
creep into the calculation let me
explain<00:02:22.600> what<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.740> phonetic

code<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.360> mnemonic<00:02:26.170> device<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> use<00:02:27.430> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
code a mnemonic device that I use that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.210 
code a mnemonic device that I use that
allows<00:02:27.940> me<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.240> convert<00:02:28.720> numbers<00:02:29.050> into<00:02:29.920> words

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
allows me to convert numbers into words

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
allows me to convert numbers into words
I<00:02:30.610> store<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.150> as<00:02:31.300> words<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.810> later<00:02:32.050> on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I store them as words and later on

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
like that and I'll try and figure out

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.550 
like that and I'll try and figure out
the<00:03:09.880> answer<00:03:10.060> which<00:03:10.570> could<00:03:11.320> be<00:03:11.410> pretty

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
the answer which could be pretty

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
the answer which could be pretty
entertaining<00:03:11.740> in<00:03:12.220> itself<00:03:12.459> if<00:03:13.120> however<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.750> am

that<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.160> got<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.550> answer<00:03:21.940> right<00:03:22.120> because<00:03:22.390> this

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
that I got the answer right because this

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.340 
that I got the answer right because this
is<00:03:22.660> my<00:03:22.780> Big<00:03:22.989> Finish

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
say three billion take the two forty

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.650 
say three billion take the two forty
nine<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.519> took<00:04:00.700> cookie<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.269> forty<00:04:01.630> nine

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
nine and that took cookie to forty nine

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.199 
nine and that took cookie to forty nine
oops<00:04:02.140> but<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> carry<00:04:02.980> coming<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.850> forty
