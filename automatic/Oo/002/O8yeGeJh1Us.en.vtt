00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
what we're looking at here is the front

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.039 
what we're looking at here is the front
of<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:04.370> cantilevered<00:00:05.370> exterior<00:00:05.940> ceiling<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
of a cantilevered exterior ceiling and

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.100 
of a cantilevered exterior ceiling and
you<00:00:07.080> see<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.340> roof<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.700> top<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.510> underneath

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
you see the roof on top and underneath

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680 
you see the roof on top and underneath
looks<00:00:10.380> like<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.679> has<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> light<00:00:11.190> gray<00:00:11.580> or<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
looks like it has a light gray or a

light grayish blue whatever that would

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.159 
light grayish blue whatever that would
be<00:00:15.679> ceiling<00:00:16.679> and<00:00:16.919> the<00:00:16.949> ceiling<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.970> actually

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
be ceiling and the ceiling is actually

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.309 
be ceiling and the ceiling is actually
plywood<00:00:19.169> t-111<00:00:20.029> don't<00:00:21.029> forget<00:00:21.239> t-111<00:00:21.659> plywood

plywood t-111 don't forget t-111 plywood
comes<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.679> a<00:00:22.769> variety<00:00:22.919> of<00:00:23.249> different<00:00:23.339> sizes

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
comes in a variety of different sizes

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.450 
comes in a variety of different sizes
and<00:00:24.269> lengths<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:26.069> looks<00:00:26.220> like

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and lengths this actually looks like

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779 
and lengths this actually looks like
it's<00:00:26.669> four-inch<00:00:27.269> groove<00:00:28.130> spacing<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
it's four-inch groove spacing the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.969 
it's four-inch groove spacing the
grooves<00:00:30.089> on<00:00:30.329> it<00:00:30.449> would<00:00:30.569> be<00:00:30.689> four<00:00:30.960> inches<00:00:31.319> and

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:31.979 
grooves on it would be four inches and

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.799 
grooves on it would be four inches and
of<00:00:32.099> course<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> does<00:00:32.609> make<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.879> nice<00:00:33.300> ceiling

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
of course it does make a nice ceiling

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
of course it does make a nice ceiling
actually<00:00:34.230> used<00:00:34.500> something<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.519> this<00:00:35.789> on<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
actually used something like this on a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.849 
actually used something like this on a
ceiling<00:00:36.269> I<00:00:36.539> built<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.320> homes<00:00:37.559> one

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
ceiling I built it one of my homes one

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.500 
ceiling I built it one of my homes one
time<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:39.059> turned<00:00:39.269> out<00:00:39.390> great<00:00:40.370> however

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
time and it turned out great however

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.040 
time and it turned out great however
don't<00:00:42.510> forget<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.710> plywood<00:00:44.570> when<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
don't forget that plywood when it is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
don't forget that plywood when it is
exposed<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.429> looking<00:00:47.760> at

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
exposed and that's what we're looking at

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.919 
exposed and that's what we're looking at
here<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.719> edge<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.499> the<00:00:50.070> plywood<00:00:50.699> is<00:00:51.510> not

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
here the edge of the plywood is not

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.439 
here the edge of the plywood is not
painted<00:00:52.679> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> other

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
painted and you can see in the other

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
painted and you can see in the other
picture<00:00:55.109> that<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> roof<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.249> sloping<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
picture that the roof is sloping the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
picture that the roof is sloping the
other<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.359> so<00:00:57.420> you're<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.839> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
other way so you're not going to get a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.610 
other way so you're not going to get a
lot<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.769> water<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.659> the<00:01:00.659> edge<00:01:00.870> here

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
lot of water off of the edge here

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.990 
lot of water off of the edge here
however<00:01:02.870> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.610> enough<00:01:05.610> moisture

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
however if you do get enough moisture

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.950 
however if you do get enough moisture
over<00:01:06.479> time<00:01:07.079> the<00:01:07.860> plywood<00:01:08.700> what's<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
over time the plywood what's it going to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
over time the plywood what's it going to
do<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.070> apart<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.939> that's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
do it's going to come apart and that's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
do it's going to come apart and that's
of<00:01:12.810> course<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:14.009> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> prevent<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of course what you want to prevent now I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
of course what you want to prevent now I
would<00:01:15.420> imagine<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.950> plywood

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
would imagine it one time the plywood

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.630 
would imagine it one time the plywood
butted<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.180> against<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> fascia<00:01:18.899> board<00:01:19.640> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
butted up against the fascia board and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.389 
butted up against the fascia board and
somehow<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.329> fascia<00:01:22.020> board<00:01:22.380> expanded<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
somehow the fascia board expanded I

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.270 
somehow the fascia board expanded I
doubt<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> original<00:01:24.479> builder<00:01:25.280> wouldn't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
doubt if the original builder wouldn't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.080 
doubt if the original builder wouldn't
have<00:01:26.399> painted<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> area<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:28.340> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.909> could

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have painted this area if if you could

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
have painted this area if if you could
see<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.530> wouldn't<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> bad

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
see it like that so wouldn't be a bad

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850 
see it like that so wouldn't be a bad
idea<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.880> paint<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.780> edge<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.530> again

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
idea just paint the edge here and again

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.639 
idea just paint the edge here and again

you<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.900> some<00:02:10.650> type<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you have some type of a would you have a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
you have some type of a would you have a
redwood<00:02:12.420> deck<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
redwood deck and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.809 
redwood deck and
you<00:02:13.379> want<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.859> stay<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.099> way<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.519> don't

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you want it to stay that way you don't

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.429 
you want it to stay that way you don't
want<00:02:14.969> it<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.299> treated<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:15.959> mind<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
want it to be treated you don't mind it

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.520 
want it to be treated you don't mind it
it<00:02:17.249> turning<00:02:17.969> gray<00:02:18.209> eventually<00:02:18.930> whatever<00:02:19.379> this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
it turning gray eventually whatever this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.110 
it turning gray eventually whatever this
is<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.829> look<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.219> looking<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.909> then

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is the look you're looking for then

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.520 
is the look you're looking for then
obviously<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.719> wouldn't<00:02:21.959> need<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.319> treat

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
obviously you wouldn't need to treat

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.089 
obviously you wouldn't need to treat
these<00:02:22.739> areas<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.299> you<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:25.170> come<00:02:25.469> across<00:02:25.499> an

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
these areas but if you do come across an

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.789 
these areas but if you do come across an
area<00:02:26.599> like<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> good

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
area like this and this is a good

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.879 
area like this and this is a good
example<00:02:28.829> where<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.639> have<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:31.409> entire

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
example where you have the entire

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.220 
example where you have the entire
building<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.519> painted<00:02:33.060> except<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.659> one<00:02:33.870> spot

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
building is painted except for one spot

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.860 
building is painted except for one spot
or<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.739> couple<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> spots<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:36.060> wouldn't<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
or a couple of spots then wouldn't be a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.259 
or a couple of spots then wouldn't be a
bad<00:02:37.079> idea<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.500> fix<00:02:38.010> something<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.879> this<00:02:39.090> as

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
bad idea to fix something like this as

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.619 
bad idea to fix something like this as
soon<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.629> possible<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.349> keep<00:02:40.859> in<00:02:41.069> mind

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
soon as possible and keep in mind

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.539 
soon as possible and keep in mind
replacing<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.810> ceiling<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.499> this<00:02:43.799> might<00:02:44.280> cost

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
replacing a ceiling like this might cost

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.640 
replacing a ceiling like this might cost
you<00:02:44.819> about<00:02:44.969> let's<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:45.959> say<00:02:46.079> a<00:02:46.109> thousand

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
you about let's just say a thousand

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.949 
you about let's just say a thousand
dollars<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:48.239> much<00:02:48.359> is<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.599> going<00:02:48.689> to<00:02:48.750> cost

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
dollars but how much is it going to cost

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.050 
dollars but how much is it going to cost
for<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.560> paint<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.189> paintbrush<00:02:50.609> you

for a can of paint and a paintbrush you

know twenty or thirty dollars let's say
and<00:02:55.650> again<00:02:55.949> if<00:02:56.069> you're<00:02:56.189> watching<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.639> video

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.899 
and again if you're watching this video
in<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.689> year<00:02:57.949> 2050<00:02:58.949> it<00:02:59.189> might<00:02:59.459> cost<00:02:59.699> you<00:02:59.879> a

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
in the year 2050 it might cost you a

in the year 2050 it might cost you a
hundred<00:03:00.030> dollars<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.079> would<00:03:01.620> imagine<00:03:01.799> the

hundred dollars but I would imagine the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.000 
hundred dollars but I would imagine the
repairs<00:03:02.639> would<00:03:03.629> instead<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.409> costume<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.949> a

repairs would instead of costume you a

repairs would instead of costume you a
thousand<00:03:05.579> might<00:03:05.699> cost<00:03:05.969> you<00:03:06.120> two<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.389> three

thousand if that's the case if they even
