00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
working at the dig site quarry where

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.609 
working at the dig site quarry where
bones<00:00:18.449> could<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.720> sticking<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> side

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
of a cliff it's pretty surreal because

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.609 
of a cliff it's pretty surreal because
those<00:00:21.630> bands<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.140> buried<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
millions of years and there you are

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
millions of years and there you are
digging<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.890> exposing<00:00:26.519> them<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.230> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
digging them up exposing them and the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130 
digging them up exposing them and the
realism<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> there<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.730> any<00:00:29.760> animals<00:00:30.330> alive

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
realism that there are any animals alive

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.889 
realism that there are any animals alive
today<00:00:31.520> like<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.120> creatures<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> you're

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
today like the creatures that you're

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
today like the creatures that you're
digging<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> those

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
know I worked at a dig site that hadn't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
know I worked at a dig site that hadn't
a<00:00:42.750> recorded<00:00:43.260> data<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.950> able<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> name<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I named it dame for because it was at

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
I named it dame for because it was at
the<00:00:46.739> side<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> cliff<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.940> felt<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the side of the cliff it felt like the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it was quite a drop I felt really

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
it was quite a drop I felt really
confident<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.739> site<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> few<00:00:56.670> from

the<00:01:08.010> side<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> cliff<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.970> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the side of the cliff and I really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
the side of the cliff and I really
wanted<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> try<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> dig<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.400> there

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
wanted to try and dig it out but there

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.700 
wanted to try and dig it out but there
were<00:01:11.610> also<00:01:11.820> other<00:01:12.270> birds<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
were also other birds and one of the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
were also other birds and one of the
most<00:01:13.860> beautiful<00:01:14.159> was<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.880> rib<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.140> was

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
most beautiful was this rib and I was

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.649 
most beautiful was this rib and I was
able<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.189> without<00:01:18.150> any

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
able to take that out without any

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.100 
able to take that out without any
problems<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.710> issues<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.750> happy

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
problems or issues so I was really happy

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
problems or issues so I was really happy
with<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.189> unfortunately<00:01:23.340> when<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> tried

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with that but unfortunately when I tried

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060 
with that but unfortunately when I tried
to<00:01:24.540> take<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> feem<00:01:25.049> about<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> plaster

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to take the feem about in a plaster

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730 
to take the feem about in a plaster
jacket<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.820> end<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.420> stuck<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.409> really

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
jacket the end was stuck in a really

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
jacket the end was stuck in a really
hard<00:01:29.040> laying<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> rock<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.479> remains

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
hard laying of a rock and it remains

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.179 
hard laying of a rock and it remains
stuck<00:01:31.560> while<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.700> rest<00:01:32.970> broke<00:01:33.600> free<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
stuck while the rest broke free so it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
stuck while the rest broke free so it
was<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.610> clean<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.750> was

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
was pretty clean but it was

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
was pretty clean but it was
disappointing<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> fact<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.820> wasn't

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
disappointing at the fact that I wasn't

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
disappointing at the fact that I wasn't
able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> entire<00:01:40.320> femur<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> one

able to take the entire femur out in one

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.990 
able to take the entire femur out in one
piece<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.090> ah<00:01:42.770> never<00:01:43.770> mind<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> saying

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
piece so ah never mind there's a saying

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
piece so ah never mind there's a saying
in<00:01:45.240> parent<00:01:45.600> ology<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.290> make<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
in parent ology that you make the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.170 
in parent ology that you make the
biggest<00:01:46.979> discoveries<00:01:47.790> when<00:01:48.030> you're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
biggest discoveries when you're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.420 
biggest discoveries when you're
finishing<00:01:48.570> off<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> that's<00:01:49.680> exactly<00:01:50.009> what

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
finishing off and that's exactly what

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
finishing off and that's exactly what
happened<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> me<00:01:51.049> one<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> last

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
happened to me one of the last

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
happened to me one of the last
opportunities<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> could<00:01:53.579> work<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.210> fall

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
opportunities I could work at don't fall

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.620 
opportunities I could work at don't fall
I<00:01:54.810> found<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.680> juvenile<00:01:56.280> Allosaurus<00:01:57.060> tooth<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
I found a juvenile Allosaurus tooth and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.010 
I found a juvenile Allosaurus tooth and
it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.320> absolutely<00:01:59.329> fantastic<00:02:00.329> finding

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it was just absolutely fantastic finding

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.170 
it was just absolutely fantastic finding
that<00:02:01.140> juvenile<00:02:01.680> Allosaurus<00:02:02.430> chief<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that juvenile Allosaurus chief is just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
that juvenile Allosaurus chief is just
brilliant<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.649> helps<00:02:05.070> build<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
brilliant because it helps build up a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
brilliant because it helps build up a
picture<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> area<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.439> been

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
picture of what the area would have been

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
picture of what the area would have been
like<00:02:07.799> during<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> time<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> dinosaurs<00:02:09.360> were

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
like during the time the dinosaurs were

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
like during the time the dinosaurs were
alive<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.679> start<00:02:10.920> understanding<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
alive and you start understanding the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.370 
alive and you start understanding the
behavior

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
behavior

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.800 
behavior
and<00:02:12.650> what<00:02:12.950> actually<00:02:13.370> happened<00:02:13.850> at<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.510> dig

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and what actually happened at this dig

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.440 
and what actually happened at this dig
site<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:16.010> overall<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.520> was<00:02:16.790> able<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.270> quite

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
site so overall I was able to make quite

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.510 
site so overall I was able to make quite
a<00:02:17.510> lot<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.750> discoveries<00:02:18.380> at<00:02:18.560> my<00:02:18.680> dig<00:02:18.920> site<00:02:19.190> but

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
a lot of discoveries at my dig site but

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.670 
a lot of discoveries at my dig site but
I<00:02:19.550> was<00:02:19.730> also<00:02:19.880> able<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.420> help<00:02:20.600> other<00:02:21.020> dig<00:02:21.380> sites

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
I was also able to help other dig sites

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.580 
I was also able to help other dig sites
and<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.360> other<00:02:23.600> people<00:02:24.080> had<00:02:24.200> discovered

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
and see what other people had discovered

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.680 
and see what other people had discovered
a<00:02:24.860> lot<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> best<00:02:25.640> things<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.090> was<00:02:26.240> able<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
a lot of the best things I was able to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.890 
a lot of the best things I was able to
view<00:02:26.900> upon<00:02:27.260> was<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.250> part<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> skull<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.690> an

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
view upon was a part of the skull of an

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.650 
view upon was a part of the skull of an
Allosaurus<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.520> dugall<00:02:32.150> which<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.630> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
Allosaurus it was a dugall which is a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.750 
Allosaurus it was a dugall which is a
bone<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.230> pretty<00:02:33.740> much<00:02:33.950> underneath<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
bone that's pretty much underneath the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.690 
bone that's pretty much underneath the
eye<00:02:35.090> socket<00:02:35.810> or<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.110> orbit<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.520> was

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
eye socket or the orbit so that was

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.310 
eye socket or the orbit so that was
absolutely<00:02:37.880> incredible<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:38.870> school

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
absolutely incredible to see school

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.440 
absolutely incredible to see school
material<00:02:39.920> from<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> apex<00:02:40.910> predators

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
material from one of the apex predators

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.450 
material from one of the apex predators
of<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.630> Jurassic<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.830> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.130> get<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
of the Jurassic so if you get the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.430 
of the Jurassic so if you get the
opportunity<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:44.150> dig<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.600> dinosaur<00:02:44.780> bones<00:02:45.080> I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
opportunity to dig for dinosaur bones I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.050 
opportunity to dig for dinosaur bones I
can't<00:02:45.830> guarantee<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.430> you're<00:02:46.700> going<00:02:46.850> to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
can't guarantee that you're going to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.850 
can't guarantee that you're going to
find<00:02:47.300> something<00:02:47.660> because<00:02:48.050> there<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:48.560> times

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
find something because there are times

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860 
find something because there are times
where<00:02:49.100> people<00:02:49.130> dig<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.910> dinosaur<00:02:50.060> bones<00:02:50.420> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
where people dig for dinosaur bones and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.650 
where people dig for dinosaur bones and
don't<00:02:51.350> find<00:02:51.620> anything<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.820> my<00:02:53.000> case<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.510> was

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
don't find anything so in my case I was

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.330 
don't find anything so in my case I was
very<00:02:53.840> lucky<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.410> able<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.830> do<00:02:55.010> what<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.250> did

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
very lucky to be able to do what I did

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060 
very lucky to be able to do what I did
I'm<00:02:56.300> also<00:02:56.570> writing<00:02:56.900> an<00:02:57.200> article<00:02:57.380> about<00:02:57.740> my

I'm also writing an article about my

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.890 
I'm also writing an article about my
experience<00:02:58.730> at<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> Wyoming<00:02:59.420> dinosaur

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
experience at the Wyoming dinosaur

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.620 
experience at the Wyoming dinosaur
center<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:00.590> when<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> know<00:03:01.490> more<00:03:01.670> about<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:02.600> I
