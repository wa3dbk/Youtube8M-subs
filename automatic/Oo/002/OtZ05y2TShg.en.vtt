00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everybody, I'm going to start here one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.410
 series of exercise videos 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.150
 independence of hands 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 Then we do exercises in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.690
 agility but today I'm going to start 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 talking a little exercise 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 Independence of the hands is a very 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 important for those who are starting to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 play the piano even for those who are already in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.970
 intermediate level and everything else because the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.740
 The logic of playing keyboard and piano is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.559
 one hand 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.559
 do things completely different from 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 do completely different things 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 and for this we have to teach to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.860
 our brains that every hand will do 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 a different thing then for that to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 We have some exercises, actually. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.899
 has many many many exercises 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.120
 exercise that I will spend here some 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.420
 I learned when I was studying. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.210
 in school are other 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 I learned on the internet so I 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'm going to take a lot of videos and it 's not much 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.939
 exercise I learned here in the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.439
 internet to pass to you 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 many of them are in English and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.700
 Portuguese has little is yet 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.009
 I think soon will have a lot of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 thing in Portuguese English and has 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.040
 Pretty cool thing about the piano is and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.049
 others also that I saw in books then 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.329
 Anyway, I'll spend all that I 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.369
 I think I know of 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.790
 independence of the hands and today we will 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.369
 start with a calmer course the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.920
 easier to do and then 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 we are increasing the degree of complexity 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.280
 of the exercises 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 O come first you remember there's 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.410
 larger scale of the scale right 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.270
 it that our base scale gives the first 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:08.390
 exercise you will do the same scale 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.390
 only with both hands at the same time 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:25.550
 All right, start slowly, put the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:28.280
 metronome 224 57 puts the metronome to 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.599
 beat the time right after 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.599
 go through the city 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.220
 then I'll increase the speed 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.959
 adjusting the precision there makes a 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.910
 warming hands I did not 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.670
 heating'm already recording directly here 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.670
 but he always does a warm up and does it 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 the always plays the notes together 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.180
 this is the first exercise that goes 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.069
 increasing the speed a little 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 second exercise and will do the same 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:09.659
 thing only now on the right hand you 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.909
 will play this catuta staccato is when 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:18.209
 You play the note that way. 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:22.489
 knows that it is different from the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.620
 right legato that is touching the notes 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.959
 followed by one another that makes a 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 smooth passage from one note to the other 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.340
 it's on the right hand 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.180
 You'll play staccato in the hand. 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.730
 left 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.489
 You will touch the legacy that you will make. 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:50.659
 the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:54.000
 one two three four five six seven 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.739
 Good that you're teaching for yours. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.750
 brain that a hand will do a thing 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.669
 that the other will do the same as 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.259
 we are working for now 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.329
 same scale 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.849
 You 're doing different things to 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.239
 each of the hands and then you reverse 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.329
 in the right hand and touch the connected is the 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:21.479
 legato and in the left hand becomes 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:23.699
 status will stay kind 17 beauty makes 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.870
 this greatly increasing the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.669
 velocity 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.990
 you will see that little by little you go 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.849
 earn enough performance in the hands 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.580
 next in the next video we 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.210
 passes some legal exercises to 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.210
 independence
