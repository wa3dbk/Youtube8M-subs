and it's positively medieval this was
the<00:01:05.509> type<00:01:05.690> of<00:01:05.720> helmet<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.740> was<00:01:06.890> born<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.399> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
the type of helmet that was born in the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.310 
the type of helmet that was born in the
Middle<00:01:07.700> Ages<00:01:07.820> by<00:01:08.570> archers<00:01:10.929> you'll<00:01:11.929> notice<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
Middle Ages by archers you'll notice the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.740 
Middle Ages by archers you'll notice the
shape<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.800> helmet<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.250> very<00:01:13.460> flat<00:01:13.789> and<00:01:14.119> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
shape of the helmet is very flat and the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.810 
shape of the helmet is very flat and the
reason<00:01:15.110> for<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:16.220> not<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.490> protect

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
reason for that is it's not to protect

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.639 
reason for that is it's not to protect
against<00:01:17.240> rifle<00:01:17.750> bullets<00:01:18.050> being<00:01:18.229> fired<00:01:18.350> from

concerned about true blocks the Germans

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.830 
concerned about true blocks the Germans
came<00:01:33.009> up<00:01:33.220> with<00:01:33.460> an<00:01:33.549> innovative<00:01:33.790> helmet<00:01:34.479> design

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
came up with an innovative helmet design

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080 
came up with an innovative helmet design
that<00:01:35.409> rapidly<00:01:35.890> reduced<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.520> number<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.850> head

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
that rapidly reduced the number of head

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.520 
that rapidly reduced the number of head

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
of its shape German designers take on

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.270 
of its shape German designers take on
the<00:01:51.940> idea<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.690> building<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.409> helmet<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:54.009> gives

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the idea of building a helmet that gives

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.499 
the idea of building a helmet that gives
full<00:01:54.700> peripheral<00:01:55.600> vision<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.950> still<00:01:57.509> maximum

full peripheral vision but still maximum

full peripheral vision but still maximum
protection<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.619> head<00:01:59.860> in<00:02:00.100> order<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.180> do

protection to the head in order to do

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.550 
protection to the head in order to do
this<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.899> take<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.979> bucket<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.869> comes<00:02:05.319> down

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
this you take a bucket that comes down

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.100 
this you take a bucket that comes down
far<00:02:06.069> enough<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.520> protect<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.119> occipital<00:02:07.659> lobe

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
far enough to protect the occipital lobe

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.070 
far enough to protect the occipital lobe
at<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.009> head<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.580> then<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.690> cut

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
at the back of the head and then you cut

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.590 
at the back of the head and then you cut
away<00:02:11.530> all<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.400> parts<00:02:12.790> where<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.480> be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
away all the parts where you want to be

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.710 
away all the parts where you want to be
able<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.989> see<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:15.190> result<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.989> stall<00:02:17.560> helm

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
the other problem with it is that what

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.039 
the other problem with it is that what
you<00:03:07.079> had<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.459> could<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:09.269> nor
