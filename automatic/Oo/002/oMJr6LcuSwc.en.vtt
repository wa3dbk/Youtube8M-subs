beeswax<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.909> I'm<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.240> gonna<00:02:07.330> cut<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.720> into

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
beeswax and I'm just gonna cut it into

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.139 
beeswax and I'm just gonna cut it into
slightly<00:02:08.350> smaller<00:02:08.920> pieces<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.729> help<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.060> along

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
slightly smaller pieces to help it along

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.449 
slightly smaller pieces to help it along
melting<00:02:11.110> process<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.010> must<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.310> an

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
melting process and this must be an

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.880 
melting process and this must be an
essential<00:02:12.760> part<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.870> lip<00:02:14.019> balm<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.500> this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
essential part of the lip balm is this

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.770 
essential part of the lip balm is this
is<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.250> what's<00:02:15.549> going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.090> solidify<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
is really what's going to solidify it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.140 
is really what's going to solidify it
okay<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.849> then<00:02:19.120> from<00:02:19.630> there<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:22.000> to

okay and then from there we are going to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.509 
okay and then from there we are going to
melt<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.569> down<00:02:22.810> okay<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.380> once<00:02:24.099> it's<00:02:24.340> melted

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
call it Katy Styles lip on we can no

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.640 
call it Katy Styles lip on we can no
should<00:04:29.889> there<00:04:30.039> be<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.159> high<00:04:30.340> demand<00:04:30.610> for<00:04:30.909> it<00:04:31.650> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
should there be a high demand for it and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.070 
should there be a high demand for it and
so<00:04:33.639> then<00:04:33.970> Vanessa<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.360> guess<00:04:34.389> this<00:04:34.659> is<00:04:34.810> probably

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
so then Vanessa I guess this is probably

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.839 
so then Vanessa I guess this is probably
a<00:04:35.169> good<00:04:35.289> time<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.530> fill<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.830> jars<00:04:36.159> before<00:04:36.490> it

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
a good time to fill the jars before it

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.550 
a good time to fill the jars before it
solidifies<00:04:37.330> yeah<00:04:37.599> absolutely

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
solidifies yeah absolutely

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560 
solidifies yeah absolutely
so<00:04:38.889> Vanessa<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:39.639> came<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.120> with<00:04:40.150> some<00:04:40.419> really

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
so Vanessa and came up with some really

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.140 
so Vanessa and came up with some really
good<00:04:40.840> ideas<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.830> containers<00:04:42.460> for<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:42.969> lip

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
good ideas of containers for the lip

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.300 
good ideas of containers for the lip
balm<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.690> thought<00:04:44.289> this<00:04:44.409> was<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:45.159> of<00:04:45.250> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
balm I thought this was one of the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.339 
balm I thought this was one of the
cutest<00:04:45.639> because<00:04:46.449> it's<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.690> great<00:04:46.870> gift<00:04:47.110> size

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
cutest because it's a great gift size

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.129 
cutest because it's a great gift size
and<00:04:48.130> definis<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.120> gonna<00:04:49.360> show<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:49.840> how<00:04:50.110> she

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
and definis is gonna show you how she

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.070 
and definis is gonna show you how she
skillfully<00:04:51.039> fills<00:04:51.340> them<00:04:51.639> I<00:04:51.990> personally<00:04:52.990> think

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
skillfully fills them I personally think

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.749 
skillfully fills them I personally think
I'd<00:04:53.229> make<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.440> mess<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:53.979> she's<00:04:54.460> using

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
I'd make a mess of this she's using

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.810 
I'd make a mess of this she's using
almost<00:04:55.599> like<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.780> wide<00:04:56.080> popsicle<00:04:56.800> stick<00:04:57.070> yeah

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
almost like a wide popsicle stick yeah

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.640 
almost like a wide popsicle stick yeah
it<00:04:57.940> just<00:04:58.120> makes<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.389> so<00:04:58.659> much<00:04:58.840> easier<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.440> fill

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
it just makes it so much easier to fill

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.519 
it just makes it so much easier to fill
yeah<00:05:00.009> not<00:05:00.729> making
