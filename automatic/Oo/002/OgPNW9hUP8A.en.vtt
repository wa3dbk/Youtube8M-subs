00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.300
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.070
 another comment with face cam yes 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.230
 In the background you can see one of the cops 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.350
 It is two gameplay on the parade 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.640
 I think yes plays with the hhr and 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.410
 I would also like to do so now 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.270
 not say because da da dam and is to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.810
 Anyway, I'll go for it today 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.550
 is a video answer to the video 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.480
 the new video from the court of duty 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.950
 player in 1993 because did the same to also 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.510
 to say a few things he meant so 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.190
 it can not go on the community 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.070
 it just does not work that way and I am the one 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.719
 same opinion who is is just like that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.800
 and I have them right on it 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.899
 written to me if I do something like that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.100
 may is a video can easily post 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.719
 so first of all thank you to me 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.129
 every case is a correct type 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.719
 We'll have every case, too 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.339
 I think I can do a lot together 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.870
 cool and javi entirely on a far 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.460
 community project we start to us 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 Therefore, think carefully because it can 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.620
 it should go on being smaller 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.960
 So youtube is now talking about the 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.590
 Commentators scene finished because 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.010
 you allegedly concepts pucker yes so 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.360
 it's not that as well as the navi 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.010
 everything is beautiful vivid community 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.110
 already noticed I have indeed 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 make a fm ask left tips give 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.890
 and then it says 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.630
 Rostow reads in the end yes what is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.710
 for since the people you can not help 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
 More on youtube I mean 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 commander warrior times we commented 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.830
 make all comments is that too 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.470
 So then, what do you want? 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.300
 quite honestly that people finished 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.760
 to be made because of concept stealing something 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 is that please people so everyone can 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.080
 that on youtube do what ambri for 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.360
 is it there or not so I find 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.950
 that really extremely off me and I mean 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.170
 just the smaller youtubers than the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.420
 difficult terrain today because it is quite 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.510
 simply a commentator overflows it 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.380
 there are far too many people 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.910
 respectively are not too many 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.010
 just a great variety but it is 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.190
 hold accordingly also hard for the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.720
 new ones for the smaller ones 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.519
 come 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.700
 and yes, people just get ready 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.800
 Made because they do what others do 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.330
 people have already done and me 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.319
 In any case I think that then 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.120
 you could not do anything anymore 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 it would just nothing more go to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.690
 the long-term project, so to speak, was yes 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.240
 even I mean I called it that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.690
 I want 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.220
 so not what I know before 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.690
 not even started with youtube 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.950
 Of course I have commented 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650
 already looked but I knew I 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.460
 really what that is whether his community 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.730
 So there's something and I just have it like that 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.530
 called and yes I mean there was road to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.930
 comment mw2 or something 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.250
 that is not exactly the same as us 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.020
 should all of us do so 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.340
 Everything should be a bit on the ground 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.260
 stay on the carpet 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.940
 they say because I mean we the people 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.830
 but make unnecessary stress if we 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.020
 the community here destroyed and robin 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.520
 has already said correctly we are not 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.590
 Community has not been around for a long time 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.840
 not so long as myself 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.520
 I joined the youtube scene there 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.790
 it was not a community anymore either 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.440
 I have to say really is that bad all 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.270
 honestly, when we all work together 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.370
 would the big and little together 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.010
 what we can then do everything for what 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.590
 doors would we insist on it would be so 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.880
 We could do so much together 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.920
 work and make it easy 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.920
 I celebrate his head, too 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.210
 exaggerated because he looks at you doctors 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.820
 he was also in his new book 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.570
 I comment with people 3 400 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.980
 subscribers 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.800
 he would laugh about that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.120
 That's just the way it is 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.590
 just awesome what he makes me sad 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.620
 leave you now I give now 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.940
 chance guest comes to me to do something 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.200
 unfortunately very few perceive and yes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.580
 then, of course, always call her 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.020
 can you as happy with me and advertising 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.760
 yes send me just succeed from yours 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.010
 video what you have loaded unresolved 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.240
 from the commentary and send it 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.340
 multiple I will tell you then on me 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.990
 or will not take and she 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 but agree are actually 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.400
 very good chances to get in there 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.810
 every case 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.000
 it just can not go on the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.710
 call of duty play is the one with relative 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.920
 much destroyed by such a shit so 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.260
 just because he has his five reaction video 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.920
 since it has been almost totally monstrous 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 because what's going on there yes that has that too 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.520
 ever did that ever 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.870
 makes yes and has no idea alberto has 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 probably would not even invented 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.910
 made it more often for a while 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.020
 So I mean what's the point 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.200
 if we all now a bit 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.860
 would work together then we would 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.090
 it's the little one 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.669
 Just make it easier a bit 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.560
 to come up with more fun in the matter 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.310
 and I'll tell you people I'll tell 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.860
 you really 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.099
 There are really really many 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.289
 little commentators that very much 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.490
 Do a better job than some big ones 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.909
 I really have to say that's mine 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.199
 I have often noticed that not only 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.560
 the big ones here always the good ones 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.990
 are 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.219
 Robin said that too 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.039
 watch the video in any case 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.210
 that's here on the is a video 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.729
 answer to this video 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.330
 that's why it's easy 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.159
 to link 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.810
 I do not know how that with video 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.180
 answers like everything runs like that 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.120
 is linked and so you'll get up 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.610
 can look at every case 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.409
 and yes, as I said again, I am already 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.590
 it just does not feel like it either 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.599
 more so much fun if that's always the case 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.719
 I would much rather be with each other 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.550
 understand as somehow no idea 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.659
 to somebody or somehow 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.610
 to be saved 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.960
 luckily I still have it relatively 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.460
 good luck though that with me at the 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.129
 videos too slowly starts again 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.620
 that right there if the video is three 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.089
 discs or so so that you need but 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.289
 not to say the people who are there now 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.849
 here again right at the beginning 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.960
 have been rising again all the time 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.270
 not see again 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.500
 That's why I think it's such a shame but there 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.759
 I would not change anything there 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.449
 you can not change that 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.409
 such people exist 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.779
 that's just these big ones 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.940
 ten-year-old children simply enter 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.990
 Making video and saying must be cool 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.719
 and that's how I had to be more often 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.490
 with my fans cam videos so read as 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.589
 I give a shit today it is 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.110
 I do not care you can do everything here 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:24.689
 sign to me so no matter 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.639
 So I do not worry me by 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.039
 if I would take on considerate 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.860
 what I wrote so the comments 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.550
 I think I would not have one 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.050
 more fun 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.249
 that's with many youtube and yes me 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.099
 find it as I said easy 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:43.859
 a little bit fun it is really 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.139
 so if you upload a video if i have 

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:49.049
 upload a video or see 1 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.749
 after a minute, three discs or something like that 

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:54.809
 that's really shit so it is 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:57.499
 Although all say yes itches us here 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:07:00.419
 you make you more popular you give us 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:02.849
 as attentive if you are the but 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:06.149
 Of course for people the new ones stay up 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:08.129
 channels and see the rating 56 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.819
 Dislike I say at the beginning so completely 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.909
 exaggerated 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.739
 they push away because to say that the 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.489
 People do not celebrate this, I celebrate 

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:18.319
 not that either 

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:20.699
 and so it goes on and on 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.469
 yes, I do not want to go any further 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.499
 Slip this dislike scene on everyone 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:27.809
 case it can not go on that way 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:29.849
 people then some commentators 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:33.629
 even require their subscribers 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:35.699
 to help someone because he allegedly 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:39.089
 made from these yawning ones 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:43.019
 is going but not there anymore 

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:44.759
 I almost fell the words so me 

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:48.259
 hope someday to hear anything 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.249
 better because it can not go on like that
