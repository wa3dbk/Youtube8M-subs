00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
though this week's chapter was brief it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.709 
though this week's chapter was brief it
still<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.149> cool<00:00:39.360> artwork

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
still had a lot of really cool artwork

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.270 
still had a lot of really cool artwork
in<00:00:39.989> panels<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.129> more

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
in panels and a little bit more

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
in panels and a little bit more
explanation<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.870> hell

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
explanation as to really what the hell

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860 
explanation as to really what the hell
is<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.180> firing<00:00:45.480> his

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is going on so as not is firing his

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
is going on so as not is firing his
weird<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.440> fear<00:00:46.950> missiles<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.579> over<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
weird like fear missiles all over the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
weird like fear missiles all over the
place<00:00:48.270> rukia's<00:00:49.140> dodging<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> left<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> right

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
place rukia's dodging the left and right

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
place rukia's dodging the left and right
and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:50.850> eventually<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.449> learned<00:00:51.719> why<00:00:52.079> she's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and then eventually we learned why she's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
and then eventually we learned why she's
not<00:00:52.559> succumbing<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> fear<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> his

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
not succumbing to the fear of his

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
not succumbing to the fear of his
abilities<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> apparently<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.680> because

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
abilities and apparently that's because

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.160 
abilities and apparently that's because
she's<00:00:56.460> literally<00:00:56.850> freezing<00:00:57.360> herself<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
she's literally freezing herself to the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
she's literally freezing herself to the
point<00:00:58.469> where<00:00:58.949> she's<00:00:59.280> essentially<00:00:59.760> killing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
point where she's essentially killing

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
point where she's essentially killing
herself<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> small<00:01:01.559> amount<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> time

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
herself for a small amount of time

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
herself for a small amount of time
essentially<00:01:03.300> she's<00:01:03.539> luring<00:01:04.080> her<00:01:04.260> temperature

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
essentially she's luring her temperature

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
essentially she's luring her temperature
well<00:01:05.189> below<00:01:05.549> zero<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.210> she's<00:01:06.600> also

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
well below zero and she's also

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
well below zero and she's also
incorporated<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.710> into<00:01:07.770> her<00:01:08.159> attacks<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
incorporated this into her attacks in

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
incorporated this into her attacks in
fact<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.180> she's<00:01:09.360> actually<00:01:09.570> attacking<00:01:10.380> as

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
fact when she's actually attacking as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
fact when she's actually attacking as
not<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.400> first<00:01:11.580> time<00:01:11.729> she<00:01:12.119> actually

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not for the very first time she actually

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
not for the very first time she actually
takes<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.780> chunk<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> his<00:01:13.740> shoulder<00:01:14.189> which

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
takes a chunk out of his shoulder which

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.450 
takes a chunk out of his shoulder which
immediately<00:01:14.939> freezes<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.170> impact<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
immediately freezes on an impact so it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.070 
immediately freezes on an impact so it
just<00:01:17.490> looks<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.299> dangerous<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.930> awesome

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
just looks really dangerous and awesome

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.230 
just looks really dangerous and awesome
and<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.340> where<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:21.000> not

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and this is the point where as not

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
and this is the point where as not
starts<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> freak<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.350> bit<00:01:22.680> he

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
starts to freak out a little bit he

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
starts to freak out a little bit he
starts<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.729> he<00:01:23.790> starts<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
starts to back up but he starts to not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
starts to back up but he starts to not
monologue<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.369> really

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
monologue as much and that's really

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.300 
monologue as much and that's really
where<00:01:27.150> unfortunately<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.170> only<00:01:28.740> complaint<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
where unfortunately the only complaint I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
where unfortunately the only complaint I
have<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> chapter<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.259> not

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
have for this chapter is is that as not

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
have for this chapter is is that as not
pretty<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.890> does<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.909> fifty

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pretty much does that for about fifty

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
pretty much does that for about fifty
percent<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.780> chapter<00:01:34.049> he's<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> trying

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
percent of this chapter he's just trying

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to get her to trip up but it's not going

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
to get her to trip up but it's not going
to<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.600> chapter<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.049> rupiah<00:01:40.710> just

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to work this chapter because rupiah just

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
to work this chapter because rupiah just
dominates<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> battle<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.180> there's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
dominates in this battle and there's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.819 
dominates in this battle and there's
this<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.720> panel<00:01:43.049> towards<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> end<00:01:43.530> Richie

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this one panel towards the end Richie

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
this one panel towards the end Richie
I'm<00:01:44.220> assuming<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.540> taking<00:01:45.750> him

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I'm assuming is going to be taking him

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.499 
I'm assuming is going to be taking him
out<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.829> she<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.100> instantly<00:01:47.880> freezes<00:01:48.329> him

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
out where she just instantly freezes him

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
out where she just instantly freezes him
and<00:01:48.960> she<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.530> states<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.100> she's<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and she even states that she's going to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
and she even states that she's going to
temperatures<00:01:51.720> negative<00:01:53.659> 253<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.229> just

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
temperatures negative 253 which is just

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
temperatures negative 253 which is just
crazy<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> can't<00:01:57.360> wait<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.899> he's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
crazy so I can't wait to see if he's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.209 
crazy so I can't wait to see if he's
actually<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.740> able<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.950> survive

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
actually going to be able to survive

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.950 
actually going to be able to survive
this<00:01:59.430> technique<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.390> he's<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this technique or if he's just going to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.389 
this technique or if he's just going to
shatter<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.829> bitch<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.070> he<00:02:02.369> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
shatter like the little bitch that he is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
shatter like the little bitch that he is
all<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.780> exciting<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
all I know is it's really exciting to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
all I know is it's really exciting to
get<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.860> her<00:02:05.009> fight<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:05.969> Rukia<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

get to see her fight because Rukia is
one<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> more<00:02:07.079> underplayed<00:02:07.649> characters

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
one of the more underplayed characters

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.559 
one of the more underplayed characters
when<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> come

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
when it come

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.479 
when it come
the<00:02:08.659> battles<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> series<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.769> think<00:02:10.280> other

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
the battles in the series I think other

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.860 
the battles in the series I think other
than<00:02:10.609> this<00:02:10.849> her<00:02:11.030> biggest<00:02:11.299> moment<00:02:11.749> was

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
than this her biggest moment was

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.500 
than this her biggest moment was
probably<00:02:11.900> during<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.709> Arrancar<00:02:13.519> art<00:02:13.790> but

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
probably during the Arrancar art but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.379 
probably during the Arrancar art but
still<00:02:15.109> this<00:02:15.499> is<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.889> great<00:02:16.340> addition<00:02:16.609> to<00:02:16.879> her<00:02:17.030> it

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:17.389 
still this is a great addition to her it

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.869 
still this is a great addition to her it
was<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.749> a<00:02:17.840> really<00:02:17.900> great<00:02:18.519> manga<00:02:19.519> chapter

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
was just a really great manga chapter

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.399 
was just a really great manga chapter
but<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.689> wishes<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> little<00:02:21.139> bit<00:02:21.260> more

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409

little more development and even though
her<00:02:25.010> attack<00:02:25.310> wasn't<00:02:25.639> may<00:02:25.939> be<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.269> flashy<00:02:26.569> as

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
