right<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.410> can't<00:00:10.860> fix<00:00:11.160> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
right was the one that I can't fix it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.010 
right was the one that I can't fix it's
something<00:00:12.210> that's<00:00:13.219> irreparable<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
something that's irreparable so what I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.340 
something that's irreparable so what I
did<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:17.779> uh<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> power<00:00:21.000> plug<00:00:21.660> would<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.109> right

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
did was uh the power plug would be right

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.179 
did was uh the power plug would be right
there<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.939> those<00:00:24.090> holes<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:26.010> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
there where those holes are so as you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.330 
there where those holes are so as you
can<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.910> soldered<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:28.340> because

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
can see I I soldered it up out because

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
can see I I soldered it up out because
it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.580> good<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:34.110> one

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it was good and this is it and that one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
it was good and this is it and that one
isn't<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.910> needed<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.110> replaced

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
isn't the one that needed to be replaced

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.940 
isn't the one that needed to be replaced
so<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> broken<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.230> so

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so this is the broken one right here so

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.010 
so this is the broken one right here so
I<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.160> ripped<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.760> pliers<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.360> D

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I just ripped that out with pliers I D

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
I just ripped that out with pliers I D
soldered<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.899> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
soldered the good one from here and I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.310 
soldered the good one from here and I
restarted<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> let's<00:00:48.960> test<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
restarted it to here so let's test it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.210 
restarted it to here so let's test it
and<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.680> happens

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.520 

all<00:00:59.220> right<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.610> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.360> it's<00:01:00.540> red<00:01:01.200> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
all right as you can see it's red and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.820 
all right as you can see it's red and
you<00:01:02.220> know<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> could<00:01:02.610> wiggle<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you know you could wiggle it and it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.690 
you know you could wiggle it and it
stays<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> success

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
stays on so it was a success

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
stays on so it was a success
let's<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.270> turn<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.690> here<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> there's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
let's just turn it on here and there's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.930 
let's just turn it on here and there's
the<00:01:10.860> green<00:01:11.040> light<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:12.600> originally<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.940> did

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the green light now originally I did

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.600 
the green light now originally I did
this<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.770> couldn't<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.340> thing<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
this and I couldn't get this thing to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.990 
this and I couldn't get this thing to
turn<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.300> staying<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.380> um

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
turn on it was just staying right so um

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.380 
turn on it was just staying right so um
I<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:22.080> backtracked<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.040> steps<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.790> recited

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I just backtracked my steps I I recited

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
I just backtracked my steps I I recited
it<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> second<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> second<00:01:25.890> time
