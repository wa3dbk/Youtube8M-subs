mount this on the right way and not back
so<00:02:14.349> take<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:16.050> GoPro<00:02:17.050> I'm<00:02:17.470> going<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.680> take<00:02:17.769> my

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
so take your GoPro I'm going to take my

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.789 
so take your GoPro I'm going to take my
case<00:02:17.970> pop<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.239> here<00:02:19.590> sometimes<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.680> forget

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
case pop it on here sometimes I forget

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.839 
case pop it on here sometimes I forget
which<00:02:21.010> way<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.370> thing<00:02:21.549> runs<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:23.849> let's

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
which way this thing runs and let's

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.930 
which way this thing runs and let's
double<00:02:25.239> check<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.980> sure<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
double check make sure this is on the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.710 
double check make sure this is on the
right<00:02:28.060> way<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.830> goes<00:02:30.720> so

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
right way and this is the way it goes so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.059 
right way and this is the way it goes so
you<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:36.489> curved<00:02:37.379> part<00:02:38.379> of<00:02:38.560> this

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.250 

faces<00:02:42.069> towards<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.180> bolt<00:02:43.690> side<00:02:43.989> will

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
faces towards you so the bolt side will

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.619 
faces towards you so the bolt side will
be<00:02:44.349> on<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> left-hand<00:02:44.950> side<00:02:45.269> all<00:02:46.269> right<00:02:46.329> and

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
be on the left-hand side all right and

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.970 
be on the left-hand side all right and
now<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:46.930> we're<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.349> do<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> same

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
now all we're going to do is the same

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.259 
now all we're going to do is the same
thing<00:02:48.040> we're<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.549> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> put<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> little

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
thing we're just going to put a little

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.530 
thing we're just going to put a little
bit<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.569> glue<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.970> inside<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.120> here

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
bit of glue in inside of here

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.380 
bit of glue in inside of here
I<00:02:53.310> won't<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.519> if<00:02:54.579> we<00:02:54.670> can<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.000> here<00:02:55.150> put<00:02:55.359> a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
I won't see if we can see it here put a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.430 
I won't see if we can see it here put a
little<00:02:55.569> bit<00:02:55.690> glue<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> end<00:02:56.079> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> tip<00:02:56.379> of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
little bit glue in the end of the tip of

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710 
little bit glue in the end of the tip of
this<00:02:56.560> monopod<00:02:57.099> put<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> little<00:02:57.579> bit<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.849> glue<00:02:58.090> on

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
this monopod put a little bit of glue on

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440 
this monopod put a little bit of glue on
the<00:02:59.530> tip<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.920> bolt<00:03:00.129> and<00:03:00.370> put<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.180> right<00:03:01.269> in

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the tip of the bolt and put it right in

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.390 
the tip of the bolt and put it right in
and<00:03:01.569> we'll<00:03:01.690> screw<00:03:01.930> right<00:03:02.079> in<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.530> make<00:03:03.370> sure

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
and we'll screw right in and make sure

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.280 
and we'll screw right in and make sure
you<00:03:03.579> cover<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:04.060> bottom<00:03:04.480> right<00:03:04.780> here<00:03:05.049> and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you cover this bottom right here and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.349 
you cover this bottom right here and
glue<00:03:06.220> don't<00:03:06.400> put<00:03:06.579> too<00:03:06.700> much<00:03:06.819> glue<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.209> want

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
glue don't put too much glue so you want

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:18.110

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.259 

and<00:03:19.120> then<00:03:19.930> it'll<00:03:20.079> just<00:03:20.260> place<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.530> right<00:03:20.980> in

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and then it'll just place it right in

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.210 
and then it'll just place it right in
make<00:03:22.269> sure<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.630> are<00:03:22.840> angle<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.530> right<00:03:24.040> what

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
we're going to hold it here for a couple

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.860 
we're going to hold it here for a couple
minutes<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.180> I'm<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.660> fast-forward

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
minutes so I'm going to fast-forward

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
minutes so I'm going to fast-forward
this<00:03:35.519> okay<00:03:36.690> there<00:03:37.690> we<00:03:37.810> go<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.139> mounted<00:03:38.940> right

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
this okay there we go it's mounted right

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.080 
this okay there we go it's mounted right
on<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:41.069> as<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.220> probably<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.639> right<00:03:42.880> here

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
on it as you can probably see right here

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.800 
on it as you can probably see right here
um<00:03:44.489> now<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.519> mean<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:45.970> would<00:03:46.180> let<00:03:46.329> this<00:03:46.450> cure

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
um now I mean I would let this cure

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.259 
um now I mean I would let this cure
probably<00:03:47.739> overnight<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.609> way<00:03:48.940> it's

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
probably overnight so that way it's

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.589 
probably overnight so that way it's
really<00:03:49.720> securely<00:03:50.260> on<00:03:50.500> here<00:03:51.120> but<00:03:53.669> fan<00:03:54.669> up<00:03:55.389> your
