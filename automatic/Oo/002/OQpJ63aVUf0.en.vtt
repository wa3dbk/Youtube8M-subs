00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's got some some developments on some

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's got some some developments on some
of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> larger<00:00:44.399> fowls<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:45.660> there

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
of the larger fowls as you can see there

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
of the larger fowls as you can see there
it's<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.629> spike<00:00:48.629> growing<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.680> well<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.340> tons

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's got a spike growing as well as tons

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's got a spike growing as well as tons
of<00:00:51.059> new<00:00:51.239> roots<00:00:53.270> as<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.039> think

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
of new roots as you can see and I think

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.180 
of new roots as you can see and I think
this<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.120> has<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.660> root<00:00:58.289> growing<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this one also has a root growing on the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
this one also has a root growing on the
other<00:00:59.340> side<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.940> hopefully<00:01:00.359> it'll<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
other side so hopefully it'll be a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.820 
other side so hopefully it'll be a
double<00:01:00.930> spike<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:02.309> kid<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:05.510> um

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
double spike or kid this one here um

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.730 
double spike or kid this one here um

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
just this is my all my minis tons of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.449 
just this is my all my minis tons of
growing<00:02:41.390> tips<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.410> one<00:02:42.650> here's<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.250> new

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
growing tips this one here's got new

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.020 
growing tips this one here's got new
leaf

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
leaf

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.070 
leaf
this<00:02:44.360> one<00:02:44.570> here<00:02:44.780> has<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.610> new<00:02:46.610> leaf<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.900> think

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
this one here has a new leaf and I think

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.840 
this one here has a new leaf and I think
it's<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.260> second<00:02:48.620> new<00:02:48.680> leaf<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.670> this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
it's a second new leaf actually so this

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.130 
it's a second new leaf actually so this
is<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.090> new<00:02:50.330> one<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> week<00:02:52.700> later

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
is a new one and then like a week later

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.800 
is a new one and then like a week later
this<00:02:54.140> one<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:55.630> something<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:57.670> okay

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.710 

it's<00:03:02.810> growing<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.650> has<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:06.860> spike

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it's growing this one here has a spike

it's growing this one here has a spike
that's<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.989> new<00:03:09.230> root<00:03:09.980> growth<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
that's a new root growth you can see the
