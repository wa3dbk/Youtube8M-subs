00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.870 

video<00:04:12.670> player<00:04:12.820> also<00:04:13.300> works<00:04:13.510> great<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:15.100> one

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
video player also works great but one

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.729 
video player also works great but one
little<00:04:16.209> corner<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.720> found<00:04:17.019> on<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:17.320> ROM<00:04:17.560> is

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
little corner I found on this ROM is

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.340 
little corner I found on this ROM is
that<00:04:18.150> there<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.329> no<00:04:20.820> rotation<00:04:22.110> option<00:04:23.110> on<00:04:23.200> this

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that there is no rotation option on this

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.770 
that there is no rotation option on this
ROM<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.590> don't<00:04:23.800> know<00:04:23.890> why<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.480> guess<00:04:25.480> the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
ROM I don't know why I guess the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.150 
ROM I don't know why I guess the
developer<00:04:26.260> might<00:04:26.380> have<00:04:26.530> forgotten<00:04:26.950> or

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
developer might have forgotten or

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.370 
developer might have forgotten or
something<00:04:27.490> like<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.790> wise<00:04:27.970> but<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.020> can't

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
something like that wise but I can't

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.850 
something like that wise but I can't
find<00:04:29.710> rotation<00:04:30.520> option<00:04:31.050> okay<00:04:32.050> as<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.590> can<00:04:32.740> see

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
find rotation option okay as you can see

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.980 
find rotation option okay as you can see
there<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.100> no<00:04:33.400> rotation<00:04:33.850> option<00:04:34.450> on<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> ROM

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
there is no rotation option on the ROM

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.560 
there is no rotation option on the ROM
and<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:36.340> can't<00:04:36.729> rotate<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:38.350> net<00:04:38.620> auto<00:04:39.570> rotation

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
and I can't rotate the net auto rotation

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.530 
and I can't rotate the net auto rotation
feature<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.290> don't<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.340> why<00:04:42.520> but<00:04:42.820> this<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
feature I don't know why but this is the

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
feature I don't know why but this is the
only<00:04:44.290> con<00:04:44.500> which<00:04:44.680> are<00:04:44.830> found<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:46.350> one<00:04:47.350> more

thing is then guys this ROM battery
backup<00:04:50.290> is<00:04:50.500> average<00:04:51.070> not<00:04:51.580> good<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.120> would<00:04:52.780> say

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
backup is average not good I would say

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.850 
backup is average not good I would say
average<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:53.680> smoothness<00:04:54.250> wise<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.820> very<00:04:55.150> fast

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
average but smoothness wise is very fast

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.500 
average but smoothness wise is very fast
