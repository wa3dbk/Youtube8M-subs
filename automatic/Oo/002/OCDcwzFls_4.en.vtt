00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.709 
that's right Google Google is super
expensive<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:09.059> never<00:00:09.240> want<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.510> buy<00:00:09.660> it

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
expensive and I never want to buy it

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.060 
expensive and I never want to buy it
because<00:00:10.019> I'm<00:00:10.200> like<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> only<00:00:10.800> need<00:00:11.040> it

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
because I'm like you know I only need it

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.320 
because I'm like you know I only need it
like<00:00:11.250> maybe<00:00:11.460> like<00:00:11.639> once<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.000> month<00:00:12.150> or

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
like maybe like once a month or

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.209 
like maybe like once a month or
something<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:13.110> why<00:00:13.320> would<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.559> want<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> buy<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
something so why would I want to buy a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.700 
something so why would I want to buy a
really<00:00:14.460> expensive<00:00:14.790> Google<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.410> doing

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
really expensive Google so I was doing

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
really expensive Google so I was doing
some<00:00:16.859> research<00:00:17.010> online<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.910> found<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.240> how

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
some research online and I found out how

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529 
some research online and I found out how
to<00:00:18.449> make<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.070> similar<00:00:20.070> version<00:00:20.250> using<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.240> two

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
to make a similar version using just two

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
to make a similar version using just two
ingredients<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.320> incredibly<00:00:22.859> easy<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> make

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
ingredients it's incredibly easy to make

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
ingredients it's incredibly easy to make
takes<00:00:23.970> less<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.449> five<00:00:24.600> minutes<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
takes less than five minutes but the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
takes less than five minutes but the
problem<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.789> isn't<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.449> effective<00:00:27.810> as

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
problem is it isn't as effective as

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
problem is it isn't as effective as
Google<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.859> sometimes<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.760> put<00:00:29.910> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
Google you do sometimes have to put it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400 
Google you do sometimes have to put it
on<00:00:30.090> more<00:00:30.330> than<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.779> let<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> sit<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
on more than one so let it sit for a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
on more than one so let it sit for a
while<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.040> scrub<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> away<00:00:32.460> I'll<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.969> all

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
while then scrub it away I'll have all

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
while then scrub it away I'll have all
the<00:00:33.180> details<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> corresponding<00:00:34.350> blog

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the details in the corresponding blog

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.370 
the details in the corresponding blog
post<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.790> sometimes<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
post so it is sometimes you do have to

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.930 
post so it is sometimes you do have to
work<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.770> harder<00:00:37.920> than<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
work a little harder than if you just

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.400 
work a little harder than if you just
bought<00:00:39.120> Google<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.170> you're<00:00:40.290> interested

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
bought Google but if you're interested

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.170 
bought Google but if you're interested
in<00:00:40.680> being<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:41.010> natural<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.969> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in being more natural or just like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
in being more natural or just like
making<00:00:42.480> things<00:00:42.719> yourself<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.410> then

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
making things yourself like I do then

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220 
making things yourself like I do then
this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.789> good<00:00:45.030> option<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.020> now

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this is a good option for you so now

00:00:46.230 --> 00:01:40.010 
this is a good option for you so now
onto<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.800> tutorial

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.649 

and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.090> how<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> make

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
and then that is it that is how you make

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.170 
and then that is it that is how you make
a<00:01:42.810> generic<00:01:43.170> version<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.890> googan<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.090> you
