obviously followed the Bionicle story
closely<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> recent<00:00:28.920> violin<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.609> I

closely with the recent violin is I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
closely with the recent violin is I
believe<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.090> being<00:00:30.240> re-released<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:31.140> 2015

believe it's being re-released in 2015

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.459 
believe it's being re-released in 2015
is<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> right<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.930> don't<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.020> Legos

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
is that right I don't think Legos

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.530

announce anything officially but I think

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you looking for there I think that's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
you looking for there I think that's
going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.400> pretty<00:01:05.790> divided<00:01:06.210> between<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
going to be pretty divided between the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.350 
going to be pretty divided between the
different<00:01:06.840> fans<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.409> far<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:07.979> want

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
different fans as far as what they want

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
different fans as far as what they want
personally<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> baggage<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
personally there is a lot of baggage of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.830 
personally there is a lot of baggage of
the<00:01:11.369> original<00:01:11.880> storyline<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.720> be

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the original storyline so I would be

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
the original storyline so I would be
perfectly<00:01:13.229> fine<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.710> them<00:01:13.830> reboot<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.509> but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
perfectly fine to see them reboot it but

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
perfectly fine to see them reboot it but
I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I think I would like it that would be

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
I think I would like it that would be
cool<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> captured<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
cool to see I'm kind of captured the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.109
