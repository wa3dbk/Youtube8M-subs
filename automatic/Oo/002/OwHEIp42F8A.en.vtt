world cup riders so these guys don't
even<00:02:44.849> break<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:46.140> almost<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:47.040> could<00:02:47.459> almost

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
even break I like almost I could almost

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.399 
even break I like almost I could almost
walk<00:02:47.790> quicker<00:02:48.209> than<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.390> rasterization<00:02:48.900> he's

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
walk quicker than I rasterization he's

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.869 
walk quicker than I rasterization he's
got<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> study<00:02:49.890> break<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.430> give<00:02:50.519> him<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.670> ton

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
got a study break I don't give him a ton

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.569 
got a study break I don't give him a ton
of<00:02:50.909> Daniel<00:02:51.450> yeah<00:02:52.409> there<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.709> more<00:02:52.950> riders<00:02:53.400> in

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
of Daniel yeah there is more riders in

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.170 
of Daniel yeah there is more riders in
like<00:02:53.849> top<00:02:54.180> 20<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.689> 30<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.590> South<00:02:55.950> America

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
like top 20 or 30 from South America

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.449 
like top 20 or 30 from South America
right<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.750> think<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:58.200> few<00:02:58.920> years<00:02:59.250> we're

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
right now and I think a few years we're

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.770 
right now and I think a few years we're
gonna<00:02:59.579> see<00:02:59.790> her<00:02:59.879> more<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.299> more<00:03:00.450> riders

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
gonna see her more and more riders

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.680 
gonna see her more and more riders
because<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.889> young<00:03:02.159> guys<00:03:02.370> they're<00:03:02.700> really

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
because the young guys they're really

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.500 
because the young guys they're really
crazy<00:03:03.959> over<00:03:04.260> here

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.940 

first<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.690> different<00:03:13.050> set<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> bike<00:03:13.770> so

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
first is different set up on the bike so

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
first is different set up on the bike so
everything<00:03:14.280> after<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.640> step<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.270> not<00:03:15.480> you're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
everything after this step if not you're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.210 
everything after this step if not you're
losing<00:03:15.959> speed<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.770> bottomed<00:03:17.069> out

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
losing speed because you bottomed out

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.550 
losing speed because you bottomed out
same<00:03:18.209> pressure<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.959> basically<00:03:19.319> almost

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
same pressure you basically almost

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680 
same pressure you basically almost
double<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.040> pressure<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.520> your<00:03:20.550> tires<00:03:20.690> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
double the pressure in your tires you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.120 
double the pressure in your tires you
have<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.020> cut<00:03:22.260> your<00:03:22.380> handlebar<00:03:22.830> as<00:03:22.950> well

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
have to cut your handlebar as well

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.650 
have to cut your handlebar as well
because<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.760> don't<00:03:23.970> you're<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.150> fitting

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
because you don't you're not fitting

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.949 
because you don't you're not fitting
between<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.650> walls<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.120> houses<00:03:27.390> and

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
between the walls and the houses and

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.809 
between the walls and the houses and
it's<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.860> like<00:03:28.920> different<00:03:29.610> thing<00:03:29.790> but

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
it's just like different thing but

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
it's just like different thing but
pretty<00:03:30.360> cool<00:03:30.510> too<00:03:30.750> i<00:03:30.780> mean<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.140> consequences

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
pretty cool too i mean the consequences

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.759 
pretty cool too i mean the consequences
if<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.860> crash<00:03:32.660> are<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.989> because<00:03:34.590> it's

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
if you crash are you because it's

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.430 
if you crash are you because it's
concrete<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.519> stairs<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.510> definitely<00:03:36.900> bring

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
concrete and stairs you definitely bring

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.130 
concrete and stairs you definitely bring
the<00:03:37.560> sport<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.190> go<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.420> city<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.900> not

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the sport to go to the city and not

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.990 
the sport to go to the city and not
saying<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:40.769> why<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.130> should<00:03:41.400> been<00:03:41.640> doing

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
saying that's why we should been doing

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:55.100 
saying that's why we should been doing
for<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.269> long<00:03:42.390> time

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.050 

you<00:03:56.110> can<00:03:56.290> easily<00:03:56.800> bend<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.460> wheel<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:57.880> it's

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
you can easily bend the wheel so it's

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.490 
you can easily bend the wheel so it's
really<00:03:58.270> important<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:58.990> like<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> right

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
really important to have like the right

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.490 
really important to have like the right
pressure<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.850> strong<00:04:01.120> wheels<00:04:01.500> otherwise

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
pressure and the strong wheels otherwise

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.960 
pressure and the strong wheels otherwise
you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.830> change<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.220> wheels<00:04:03.370> every<00:04:03.790> run

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you can change the wheels every run

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.630 
you can change the wheels every run
almost<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:05.320> got<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.770> 20<00:04:06.340> stairs

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
almost because you got like 20 stairs

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.820 
almost because you got like 20 stairs
dropping<00:04:07.510> on<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> fled<00:04:07.990> in<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> high-speed

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
dropping on the fled in the high-speed

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.400 
dropping on the fled in the high-speed
so<00:04:09.690> basically<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.720> would<00:04:10.930> say<00:04:11.050> this<00:04:11.200> is<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
so basically I would say this is the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.470 
so basically I would say this is the
real<00:04:11.710> testing<00:04:12.220> for<00:04:12.430> every<00:04:12.700> company<00:04:13.150> because

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
real testing for every company because

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.690 
real testing for every company because
the<00:04:13.720> frame<00:04:14.100> suspension<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.400> wheels

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
the frame suspension and the wheels

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.180 
the frame suspension and the wheels
especially<00:04:16.150> got<00:04:16.959> beaten<00:04:17.320> up<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.770> really

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
especially got beaten up like really

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:33.210 
especially got beaten up like really
hard<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:32.080> see<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.320> times<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.010> guys

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
hard here you can see the times the guys

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.670 
hard here you can see the times the guys
were<00:04:33.610> started<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.090> front<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:35.470> was

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
were started in front of you so I was

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.460 
were started in front of you so I was
standing<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.250> on<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.000> gate<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.480> like<00:04:38.230> five

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
standing on on the gate and like five

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.670 
standing on on the gate and like five
seconds<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:40.000> before<00:04:40.360> my<00:04:40.510> start<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.170> just

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
seconds just before my start I just

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.500 
seconds just before my start I just
heard<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.100> time<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.850> best<00:04:43.030> time<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
heard the time like the best time the
