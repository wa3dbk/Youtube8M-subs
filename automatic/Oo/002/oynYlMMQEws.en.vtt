simple job to notch out the corner of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.390 
simple job to notch out the corner of
the<00:04:15.239> faceplate<00:04:15.720> recess<00:04:16.199> where<00:04:17.099> we<00:04:17.220> use<00:04:17.370> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
the faceplate recess where we use a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.069 
the faceplate recess where we use a
round<00:04:17.699> cutter<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.209> leaves<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.479> radius<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.989> the

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
round cutter it leaves a radius in the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.990 
round cutter it leaves a radius in the
corners<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.799> just<00:04:19.949> chisel<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.609> corner

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
corners so we just chisel out the corner

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.620 
corners so we just chisel out the corner
to<00:04:21.180> bring<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.509> into<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.750> square<00:04:21.989> shape<00:04:22.400> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
to bring it into a square shape and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.350 
to bring it into a square shape and
that's<00:04:24.860> effectively<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.039> job<00:04:26.220> done<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
that's effectively the job done the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029 
that's effectively the job done the
vacuum<00:04:27.509> cleaner<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.349> just<00:04:28.560> vacuumed<00:04:28.919> out

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
vacuum cleaner we can just vacuumed out

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.240 
vacuum cleaner we can just vacuumed out
in<00:04:29.750> residual<00:04:30.750> sawdust<00:04:31.229> that's<00:04:31.410> in<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> pocket

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250

in residual sawdust that's in the pocket
of<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.370> door<00:04:32.840> key<00:04:33.840> nothing<00:04:34.139> miss<00:04:34.440> there's

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
of the door key nothing miss there's

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.589 
of the door key nothing miss there's
always<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> bit<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.729> residual<00:04:36.120> sawdust<00:04:36.570> that

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
always a bit of residual sawdust that

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.390 
always a bit of residual sawdust that
comes<00:04:36.930> off<00:04:37.110> particularly<00:04:37.800> from<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.099> drawing

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
so it's a quick cleanup and we can leave

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.089 
so it's a quick cleanup and we can leave

same<00:06:12.640> way<00:06:12.910> so<00:06:13.840> what<00:06:14.140> we<00:06:14.260> would<00:06:14.410> do<00:06:14.590> is<00:06:14.800> we<00:06:14.830> would

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
same way so what we would do is we would

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.770 
same way so what we would do is we would
go<00:06:15.160> to<00:06:15.220> our<00:06:15.430> wood<00:06:15.670> shop<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.180> we<00:06:16.360> would<00:06:16.540> produce

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
go to our wood shop and we would produce

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.740 
go to our wood shop and we would produce
a<00:06:17.260> wood<00:06:17.650> jig<00:06:18.370> that<00:06:18.700> we<00:06:18.820> could<00:06:19.000> use<00:06:19.180> our<00:06:19.330> routers

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
a wood jig that we could use our routers

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.200 
a wood jig that we could use our routers
clamp<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.230> onto<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.470> door<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.040> then<00:06:21.730> we<00:06:21.940> would

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
clamp it onto the door and then we would

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
clamp it onto the door and then we would
machine<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.230> door<00:06:23.410> using<00:06:23.620> a<00:06:23.830> wooden<00:06:24.040> J<00:06:24.310> and

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
machine the door using a wooden J and

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.060 
machine the door using a wooden J and
invariably<00:06:26.230> what<00:06:26.410> would<00:06:26.530> happen<00:06:26.830> is<00:06:26.950> the

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
invariably what would happen is the

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.890 
invariably what would happen is the
wooden<00:06:27.370> jig<00:06:27.580> would<00:06:27.790> be<00:06:28.620> discarded<00:06:29.620> or<00:06:30.900> damaged

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
wooden jig would be discarded or damaged

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.530 
wooden jig would be discarded or damaged
throwing<00:06:32.740> away<00:06:32.950> and<00:06:33.310> in<00:06:33.850> the<00:06:34.000> next<00:06:34.150> time<00:06:34.390> we

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
throwing away and in the next time we

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.050 
throwing away and in the next time we
went<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:34.990> install<00:06:35.340> some<00:06:36.340> more<00:06:36.490> hardware<00:06:36.880> it

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
went to install some more hardware it

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.330 
went to install some more hardware it
would<00:06:37.210> be<00:06:37.330> remade<00:06:37.840> and<00:06:38.140> that<00:06:38.560> tip<00:06:38.860> that<00:06:39.130> took

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
would be remade and that tip that took

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.330 
would be remade and that tip that took
