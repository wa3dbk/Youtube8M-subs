00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
wings of liberty collector's edition kit
just<00:00:10.620> got<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.400> while<00:00:11.670> ago<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.330> wanted

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
just got a little while ago and I wanted

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.780 
just got a little while ago and I wanted
to<00:00:12.809> let<00:00:13.620> everyone<00:00:13.769> see<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> kit

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
to let everyone see what was in the kit

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.099 
to let everyone see what was in the kit
so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> know<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:15.599> bit<00:00:15.780> more<00:00:15.900> money

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
so I know it's a little bit more money

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.220 
so I know it's a little bit more money
and<00:00:16.460> some<00:00:17.460> people<00:00:17.760> probably<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.600> fence<00:00:18.930> as

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and some people probably on the fence as

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.830 
and some people probably on the fence as
to<00:00:19.260> whether<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.859> worth<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.840> here

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
to whether it's worth or not so here

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.320 
to whether it's worth or not so here
goes<00:00:22.460> first<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
goes first of all I don't know if this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
goes first of all I don't know if this
is<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> selling<00:00:24.720> point<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
is a selling point but you do get a a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.200 
is a selling point but you do get a a
nice<00:00:26.699> box<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> definitely<00:00:28.910> nicer<00:00:29.910> than<00:00:30.000> your

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
nice box so definitely nicer than your

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.910 
nice box so definitely nicer than your
standard<00:00:30.510> packaging<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.830> going

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
standard packaging not that you're going

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.310 
standard packaging not that you're going
to<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> ton<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> extra<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to get a ton of extra use out of it but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
to get a ton of extra use out of it but
it's<00:00:34.530> something<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> shelf<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it's something to put on the shelf so

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690 
it's something to put on the shelf so
it's<00:00:36.660> probably<00:00:36.870> worth<00:00:36.989> noting<00:00:37.350> box<00:00:38.340> says<00:00:38.520> open

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it's probably worth noting box says open

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
it's probably worth noting box says open
and<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.920> teeth<00:00:41.570> type<00:00:42.570> thing<00:00:45.289> yeah
