00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.829
 our place is a dinner program 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.090

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.980
 our prize place of different 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.110
 cultural sports projects and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.250
 proposed social and carried forward 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.470
 for 58 thousand 500 boys and girls from 14 to 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.890
 18 years throughout the country and here 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.839
 develop good to the ngo as the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.210
 first project done because to 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.519
 all must include girls from 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.699
 different neighborhoods in an activity that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.680
 the one that integrates them because we saw that 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.020
 there was a sporting activity for 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 girls in popular neighborhoods then 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 behind that premise we went to try to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.590
 generate something new and we already total more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.590
 of 450 girls developing the activity 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.420
 hockey and many girls come here I 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 I think they are looking for a space 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.979
 where they can unwrap 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.800
 They have not found any friends 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.210
 companions 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.250
 a space where they learn and they believe 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.340
 that is more important apart we do 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.380
 integration workshops where we sit down 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.120
 social workers anthropologists 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 psychologists social psychologists 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.890
 talk about the problems that arise with 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.260
 the girls the key of the NGO is in no 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.910
 to fail to fulfill what we say 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.460
 we make the one who wants to come 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.650
 say exactly that we never miss 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.900
 a training we have gone until days of 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.760
 rain thinking that some will go and in 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.040
 they changed their lives since they play 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.650
 the hockey 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.360
 a lot in my place a lot because 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.040
 I could not have any relationship with the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.080
 girls was 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.090
 It was like being in my home at school 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.070
 my home from my home school and I do not 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
 spoke to anyone now not now yes with 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.150
 the girls all the time playing there 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.920
 like I change a lot not only in that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 but in the workshops he also talked to me 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 with a lot of people and I learned lots 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 of values ​​that before maybe not 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.460
 we knew and what he likes most 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.900
 of playing because workouts serve 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.060
 more for 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.030
 because with getting together between friends and not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.620
 speak no thanks girls for telling me 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.150
 what happens to them with hockey to me 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.010
 I also love hockey os 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.599
 thank you for letting me be part of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.939
 this and if you think I'll see them play 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.239
 For a while, let's start, also for coming 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.239
 To watch 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.910
 I loved it so I 'm not going to see them 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.680
 unicef ​​and the enap performed 700 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.050
 surveys to know the opinion of the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.610
 girls and boys participants and so you 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.920
 they see adequate information to improve 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.050
 policies and programs aimed at 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.879
 the teenagers 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.980
 this project is much more than sport 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.290
 It gives the opportunity to girls of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.330
 participate in building your own place 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.769
