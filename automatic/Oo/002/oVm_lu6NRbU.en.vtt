00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.760
 we are here in the half court we came 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.360
 to know a little about this project 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.279
 private football that pretends 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.970
 couple many young people who when they leave 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.080
 school or studies do not end 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.080
 they have where to practice 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.860
 the club they can become members 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.079
 counts as a soccer school 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.359
 camps tournaments and cadiz rental 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.579
 in a good location in the center of 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.469
 the young city of all ages 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 can go to practice the sport that they 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.829
 like 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.410
 but the midfield is is home to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.330
 Metropolitan Football League 5 on 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.210
 metropolitan league from where we what 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.190
 that we have developed a space where 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 the players can continue playing 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.440
 after they leave 15 years 16 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 that when nobody wants to work with 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.820
 young people who start to enter a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 complicated age then here what 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.320
 we did was develop a league where 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 they can form their teams no idea 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 and keep competing until they have 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 we have a category of over 35 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.190
 that is, they can continue playing until 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.190
 whenever you want 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.240
 but dad comes to play and can leave 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.390
 your child here who meanwhile rides 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.789
 on a bicycle or jump in bed 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.929
 jumping or playing soccer or basketball 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.640
 so it's a family environment 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.750
 People come have wives 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 it feels very nice 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.150
 during weekends also 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.040
 the Spanish league matches 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.140
 even so that everyone can enjoy 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.880
 the recent tornadoes that take place 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.310
 they have great support from the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 football community which attends 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.880
 periodically support your friends 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 family or favorite teams 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.090
 we started a relationship with guatemala 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.530
 now that we brought the coach of the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.450
 selection of guatemala to work with 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.160
 us for a while and with the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 we started a relationship where we are going to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.210
 start making tournaments bring teams of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.220
 guatemala and bring teams there too 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.000
 we plan to take the league champion to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.800
 play spain now in 2013 that is to say 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.960
 that if we are also going to expand 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.500
 outside of being out and coming to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.500
 visit us 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.110
 well we have ambulance on site all 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.769
 the hours while the league is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.660
 working with paramedics and in fact 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.180
 we have had injuries that the answer 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.580
 is immediate and takes one if you need 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.769
 It is served on the court if it is not carried 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.660
 an assistance center that is to say with that 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.120
 there is no safety problem 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
 enclosure closed with internal security 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440
 something that has differentiated us from the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.910
 rest is really the organization that 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.709
 we have managed to have here and the people 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.319
 I was looking to play in one place 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.410
 organized and that is what we are 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.410
 toasting 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.260
 the half court was a great contribution to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.550
 Dominican soccer and it's a project that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.130
 it must be limited by the sector 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.330
 business that the Dominican government 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.700
 so that many young people of the country 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.100
 continue practicing the sport after 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.560
 to finish school towards football 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.780
 a sport that generates incredible sums of 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.070
 money worldwide can continue 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.070
 growing that fundamental 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.510
 well the idea is that the average court 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.280
 keep growing the league really first 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.870
 solidify the part of the league we 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.150
 we have what are the rents of 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.720
 court on weekdays and already 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.520
 we are full that is not the demand 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.770
 greater of our offer so first 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.350
 probably expand we're going to have more 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.050
 courts here and the idea hopefully future is 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.640
 be able to have other projects in different 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.640
 places in the city or country
