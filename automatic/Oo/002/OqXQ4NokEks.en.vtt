00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.040
 it's still a magical moments 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.279
 game remained a quarter of an hour at the top 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.800
 it was my 40th birthday yeah 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.410
 it is by chance the head still full 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.590
 canvases with his friend stéphane benoît 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.400
 he has just walked the 8091 m of the summit 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.800
 of the annapurna 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.460
 we found her warm at home 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.910
 in chamonix 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.810
 but the spirit still a little there I have 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.760
 the impression of being a little in a world 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.410
 expanded what that did to me 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.410
 like a little impression 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.000
 yeah that was enough the impression finally 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.250
 I say that by joking but it was 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.670
 a bit like a rave party what face 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.719
 to images the adventure becomes real 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.000
 the opening of a 6000 neighbors for 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 acclimatize then in favor of a 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.929
 beautiful weather window does not attack 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.000
 the huge southern face of the giant is not 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.970
 the tunes the chute systems that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.320
 it's our first bivouac at 6100 in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 do it before you have some snow 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.470
 wet to make a platform for 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 put the tent 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.800
 both guides chose to join the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 summit by the mythical south face 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.330
 the one that was the shroud of stuttered stone 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 in 92 and more recently in October 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.870
 latest 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.780
 shipped in 28 hours round trip by the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.440
 fast esteem or istec a wall of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 2500 m back in front of which the man is 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.140
 feel tiny it's really huge 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.090
 and then because finally the facade to 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.300
 the effect that twice by the north face 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.260
 big jorasses this phase there but 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 but it's not even comparable 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.660
 commitment above all it's amazing 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.720
 is sick from the slopes permanently to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.750
 more than 50 degrees under the top a wall 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.460
 vertical extremely difficult 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 progression is becoming more and more 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.220
 slow 100 meters per hour on October 24 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.800
 after this box in phase i ly 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 indicated stephane reach the top and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.720
 here we come to the top so that's it 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.310
 the little men of the laden with 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.700
 dom like that we've already done four or 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.070
 five 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.209
 in fact we will go up there knowing that we must 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.550
 to go too close to the cornice 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.920
 is normal that I kiss ice axes 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.300
 why do not I know because I was 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 happy since it served me well what 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.140
 I started to understand how much 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.880
 we were engaged after the summit in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.680
 going down our bivouac at 7600 meters 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.390
 I thought ouh la la 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.600
 ouh there we are still upstairs 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.590
 a bar of 500 meters of rocks and 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.989
 vertical, you still have to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.120
 still go down not only 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.190
 the two friends are exhausted but stéphane 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.260
 suffers from pneumonia and cold 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.940
 he can no longer walk the descent 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.220
 will be a nightmare 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.230
 today yann is doing well with 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.549
 frostbite probably 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.610
 because my sock had made a 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.440
 fold under our feet for steph it's more 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.959
 severe amputations on several 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 fingers and most toes but 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.170
 for both the same conclusion 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.170
 no regrets
