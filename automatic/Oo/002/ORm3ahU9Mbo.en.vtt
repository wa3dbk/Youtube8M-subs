00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.990
 when I jake once again here mike's 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:07.990
 official gadget and we start with the video 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.029
 this time I want to teach you 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.570
 as you have been watching in my videos 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 is failing as they see the home button 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.830
 and I started searching the web for some 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.530
 remedy you could say home this 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.630
 it only works with software that 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 means inside of 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.450
 of the device not with hardware by 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.360
 say yes I would have fallen on the ipad 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.940
 and I would have broken the button this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.400
 method that serves to fix it does not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650
 it would work 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.660
 this only works in case 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.660
 descalabrÃ³ could be said in this way 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.180
 the button and then first of all we're going to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.650
 go see here as you can see what I am 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.750
 pressing and it does not work until I do 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.190
 a hard pressure is when it works and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.650
 right now at the end of the video they will see that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.440
 it improves quite a lot for this we have to 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.780
 open some active application of 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.910
 our iphone is not necessary to have 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.280
 jailbreak for this can do it 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.580
 anyone we open to say I 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.229
 I'm going to open in this the calculator has 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.940
 that the application can not be native 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.619
 open facebook or any other 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.430
 application because it will not work well 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.940
 to open it from time the calendar 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.400
 some application that already comes as it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.510
 could you say birth with your iphone 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.190
 or ipod they leave the button of the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.620
 side until the symbol appears 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.380
 turn off and then leave pressed the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.380
 camps until I take it out at spring words 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 As you can see here, I'm taking out the springboard 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600
 and then look 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.060
 already as you see it already works with greater already 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.250
 it works like new you can see that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.720
 I'm doing no pressure do not you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm lying make this method and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.130
 they are going to see they are going to think that I am 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.190
 lying but not at all 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 this method serves quite well 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.080
 try it if your button fails 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.660
 home and then leave me in the comments 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.420
