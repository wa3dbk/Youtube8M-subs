00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
see apps right move our cursor over that

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.869 
see apps right move our cursor over that
then<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.959> get<00:02:30.079> this<00:02:30.230> nice<00:02:30.469> flip<00:02:30.980> effect<00:02:31.159> what<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
then I get this nice flip effect what is

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.490 
then I get this nice flip effect what is
up<00:02:32.000> guys<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.840> even<00:02:32.870> touched<00:02:33.290> it

yellow drag it down and it starts here

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.000 
yellow drag it down and it starts here
this<00:02:40.579> is<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.000> short<00:02:41.329> dip<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:42.859> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
this is just short dip just like that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.920 
this is just short dip just like that
that's<00:02:43.310> simple<00:02:43.579> guys<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.450> want<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.659> make<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
that's simple guys if I want to make it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.679 
that's simple guys if I want to make it
slow<00:02:45.200> or<00:02:45.469> faster<00:02:45.919> I<00:02:46.129> can<00:02:46.189> linkedin<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.120> or

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
slow or faster I can linkedin it or

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.479 
slow or faster I can linkedin it or
shorten<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.379> to<00:02:48.439> make<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.680> slower<00:02:49.159> or<00:02:49.459> faster

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489

shorten it to make it slower or faster
so<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.389> shorten<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.439> Clipper<00:02:51.650> make<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:51.949> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
so just shorten the Clipper make it that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.949 
so just shorten the Clipper make it that
effect<00:02:52.370> slower<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.060> touch<00:02:53.239> just<00:02:53.569> this<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
effect slower and touch just this is

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.319 
effect slower and touch just this is
just<00:02:53.989> short<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.669> drag<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:55.879> out<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.269> of

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
just short I just drag it out and of

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.909 
just short I just drag it out and of
course<00:02:56.540> make<00:02:56.659> it<00:02:56.750> faster<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.079> drag<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.439> so

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
course make it faster you drag it in so

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.679 
course make it faster you drag it in so
that's<00:02:58.040> video<00:02:58.370> action<00:02:58.639> okay<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.389> that's<00:02:59.510> just

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
that's video action okay and that's just

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.209 
that's video action okay and that's just
a<00:02:59.810> simple<00:03:00.139> video<00:03:00.319> action<00:03:00.560> for<00:03:00.799> your<00:03:00.859> eyesight
