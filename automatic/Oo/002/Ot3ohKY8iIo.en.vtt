00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
you did you did a sort of dive on with a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.279 
you did you did a sort of dive on with a
harmonic<00:00:17.710> yeah<00:00:22.029> tall<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.060> tall<00:00:23.509> like<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:23.749> your

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
harmonic yeah tall a tall like you your

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.970 
harmonic yeah tall a tall like you your
control<00:00:24.849> yeah<00:00:26.079> this<00:00:27.079> is<00:00:27.230> something<00:00:27.499> lies<00:00:27.619> I

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
control yeah this is something lies I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.179 
control yeah this is something lies I
learned<00:00:28.759> actually<00:00:29.060> fairly<00:00:29.659> recently<00:00:30.189> about

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
learned actually fairly recently about

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.810 
learned actually fairly recently about
three<00:00:31.550> years<00:00:31.730> ago<00:00:31.849> two<00:00:32.750> maybe<00:00:33.380> two<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.670> half

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
three years ago two maybe two and a half

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.530 
three years ago two maybe two and a half
something<00:00:35.120> like<00:00:35.210> that

note playing and it just had this huge

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.760 
note playing and it just had this huge
span<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.800> know<00:00:54.830> this<00:00:55.340> uh<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:57.470> know<00:00:57.560> note

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
span you know this uh you know note

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.200 
span you know this uh you know note
value<00:00:58.100> span<00:00:58.340> or<00:00:58.520> whatever<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:58.880> want<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.030> say

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
value span or whatever you want to say

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.420 
value span or whatever you want to say
and<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.930> had<00:01:00.200> no<00:01:00.410> clue<00:01:00.590> how<00:01:00.770> he's<00:01:00.950> doing<00:01:01.220> it<00:01:01.310> you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
and I had no clue how he's doing it you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.400 
and I had no clue how he's doing it you
know<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:01.760> knew<00:01:02.000> about<00:01:02.180> these<00:01:03.050> kind<00:01:03.350> of

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
know and I knew about these kind of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.060 
know and I knew about these kind of
things<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:03.770> know<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:05.170> type<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.200> artificial

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
things you know that type of artificial

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.630 
things you know that type of artificial
harmonic<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.969> course<00:01:08.210> everybody<00:01:08.570> knows

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
harmonic and of course everybody knows

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.039 
harmonic and of course everybody knows
but<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.670> never<00:01:10.880> knew<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.119> that's<00:01:11.869> exactly

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
but I never knew that that's exactly

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.539 
but I never knew that that's exactly
what<00:01:12.439> he<00:01:12.499> was<00:01:12.590> doing<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.399> could

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
what he was doing and that you could

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.550 
what he was doing and that you could
play<00:01:13.789> him<00:01:13.909> anywhere<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.539> I<00:01:14.749> mean<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.439> can<00:01:17.560> get

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
play him anywhere so I mean you can get

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.279 
play him anywhere so I mean you can get
really<00:01:19.329> high<00:01:20.329> ones<00:01:20.569> down<00:01:20.749> there<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.170> it's

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
really high ones down there but it's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.099 
really high ones down there but it's
kind<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.499> hard<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:22.009> pull<00:01:22.219> off

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
kind of hard to pull off

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:36.780 
kind of hard to pull off
no<00:01:24.109> I<00:01:24.499> just<00:01:25.369> use<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:25.640> thumb<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.909> block<00:01:26.869> things

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.990 

well<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.860> got<00:01:39.010> them<00:01:39.130> all<00:01:39.220> over<00:01:39.490> really<00:01:39.640> so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
well and you got them all over really so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.210 
well and you got them all over really so
with<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.680> again<00:01:42.060> beast<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.270> harlots

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:08.800 

I<00:02:06.970> don't<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.030> that's<00:02:08.240> how<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.540> is<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I don't know that's how it is on the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.920 
I don't know that's how it is on the
album<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:09.140> that's<00:02:09.320> how<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.590> done<00:02:09.649> now
