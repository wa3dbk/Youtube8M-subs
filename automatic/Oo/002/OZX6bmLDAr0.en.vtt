crate<00:00:31.150> so<00:00:31.269> if<00:00:31.359> you<00:00:31.449> have<00:00:31.539> an<00:00:31.630> ammo<00:00:31.779> crate<00:00:32.020> you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
crate so if you have an ammo crate you

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.270 
crate so if you have an ammo crate you
throw<00:00:32.320> it<00:00:32.410> down<00:00:32.560> there's<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> certain

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
throw it down there's a certain

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.770 
throw it down there's a certain
percentage<00:00:33.790> I'm<00:00:33.940> not<00:00:34.060> exactly<00:00:34.300> sure<00:00:34.480> what

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
percentage I'm not exactly sure what

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.229 
percentage I'm not exactly sure what
that<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:34.989> but<00:00:35.170> there's<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.190> certain<00:00:36.700> percentage

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
that is but there's a certain percentage

gets a few kills before actually picking

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.380 
gets a few kills before actually picking
up<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.219> minigun<00:00:57.460> cuz<00:00:57.640> it's<00:00:57.820> completely

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
up the minigun cuz it's completely

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.389

invite<00:00:58.660> luck<00:00:59.019> it's<00:00:59.559> completely<00:00:59.949> by<00:01:00.070> chance

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
invite luck it's completely by chance

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.549 
invite luck it's completely by chance
it's<00:01:00.760> not<00:01:00.850> like<00:01:01.030> oh<00:01:01.179> okay<00:01:01.989> I'm<00:01:02.079> gonna<00:01:02.170> go<00:01:02.260> for<00:01:02.530> a

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
it's not like oh okay I'm gonna go for a

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.229 
it's not like oh okay I'm gonna go for a
minigun<00:01:02.829> kem<00:01:03.100> strike<00:01:03.370> by<00:01:03.550> going<00:01:03.940> over<00:01:04.120> there

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
minigun kem strike by going over there

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.270 
minigun kem strike by going over there
and<00:01:04.269> getting<00:01:04.480> that<00:01:04.629> ammo<00:01:04.900> crate<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.100> can't

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
and getting that ammo crate so you can't

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.950 
and getting that ammo crate so you can't
really<00:01:06.340> predict<00:01:07.210> if<00:01:07.330> you're<00:01:07.450> going<00:01:07.570> for<00:01:07.810> not

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
really predict if you're going for not

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840 
really predict if you're going for not
so<00:01:08.230> you<00:01:08.290> can't<00:01:08.500> really<00:01:08.560> start<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.640> new<00:01:09.790> streak

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
so you can't really start a new streak

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.880 
so you can't really start a new streak
because<00:01:10.540> once<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:10.840> die<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.590> don't<00:01:11.680> have<00:01:11.770> a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
because once you die you don't have a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.920 
because once you die you don't have a
minigun<00:01:12.220> anymore<00:01:12.579> so<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.689> know<00:01:13.780> there's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
minigun anymore so you know there's

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.330 
minigun anymore so you know there's
nothing<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.200> can<00:01:14.350> do<00:01:14.470> about<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.070> he<00:01:15.159> does

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
nothing you can do about that so he does

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.280 
nothing you can do about that so he does
get<00:01:15.490> five<00:01:15.759> kills<00:01:16.060> with<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.299> m27<00:01:16.900> before

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
get five kills with the m27 before

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.200 
get five kills with the m27 before
actually<00:01:17.619> going<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.040> streak<00:01:18.430> with<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
actually going on a streak with the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.840 
actually going on a streak with the
minigun<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:20.470> he<00:01:20.530> does<00:01:20.710> make<00:01:20.950> up<00:01:21.159> one<00:01:21.520> extra

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
minigun but he does make up one extra

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.319 
minigun but he does make up one extra
kill<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:23.320> technically<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.860> 21<00:01:24.460> kills<00:01:24.909> with

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
kill so it technically is 21 kills with

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.649 
kill so it technically is 21 kills with
the<00:01:25.479> minigun<00:01:25.869> um<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.820> that's<00:01:28.060> still<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.540> know

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
the minigun um so that's still you know

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.100 
the minigun um so that's still you know
kind<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:29.170> around<00:01:29.890> getting<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> kem<00:01:30.939> strike<00:01:31.329> he

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
kind of around getting the kem strike he

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.600 
kind of around getting the kem strike he
didn't<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.439> hard<00:01:32.680> line<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:32.920> but<00:01:33.310> anyways

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
didn't have hard line on but anyways

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.069 
didn't have hard line on but anyways
guys<00:01:33.759> hopefully<00:01:33.969> do<00:01:34.270> enjoy<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.689> gameplay<00:01:34.840> he
