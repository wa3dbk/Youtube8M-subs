00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the camera track tool click on it and we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.869 
the camera track tool click on it and we
can<00:00:58.699> move<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> scene<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.930> camera<00:01:01.230> around

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
can move the scene the camera around

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
can move the scene the camera around
note<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.120> moving<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.780> camera<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> four

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
note by moving the camera all the four

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.719 
note by moving the camera all the four
layers<00:01:06.049> they<00:01:07.049> move<00:01:07.350> together<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.670> were

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
layers they move together as they were

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
layers they move together as they were
one<00:01:09.600> single<00:01:10.350> area<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.960> create<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> 3d

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
one single area and to create a 3d

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.570 
one single area and to create a 3d
effect<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.640> must<00:01:14.909> tell<00:01:15.210> enemy<00:01:15.659> studio<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
effect we must tell enemy studio the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
effect we must tell enemy studio the
distance<00:01:18.210> between<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.350> camera<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.689> each<00:01:21.689> one

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
distance between the camera and each one

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
distance between the camera and each one
of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> layers<00:01:23.060> creating<00:01:24.060> therefore<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:28.250> 3d

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
of the layers creating therefore a 3d

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.560 
of the layers creating therefore a 3d
effect

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
effect

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840

for<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> we'll<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.680> using<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.310> translate

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

for this we'll be using the translate
layer<00:01:33.120> tool<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> moment<00:01:34.830> we<00:01:34.980> click<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
layer tool and the moment we click on it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.740 
layer tool and the moment we click on it
three<00:01:36.990> variables<00:01:37.500> show<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.270> top<00:01:39.480> of<00:01:39.660> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140 
layer the right heel the layer selected
this<00:01:51.960> puts<00:01:52.320> minus<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.940> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the scene around we'll be able to note

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.699 
the scene around we'll be able to note
that<00:02:20.120> each<00:02:21.120> layer<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.780> movement<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:24.150> moves<00:02:24.750> on

that each layer on movement it moves on

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.830 
that each layer on movement it moves on
a<00:02:25.770> different<00:02:26.190> speed<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.630> see

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a different speed as you can see

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
a different speed as you can see
creating<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.650> 3d<00:02:29.160> effect<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:31.320> make<00:02:31.500> things<00:02:31.860> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
