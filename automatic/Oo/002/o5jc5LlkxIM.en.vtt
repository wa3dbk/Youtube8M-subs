00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.880
 In this video I want to introduce you to the quaint upcoming Bamboo 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.180
 at a 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.280
 standard mouse 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.069
 you have the problem that puts the wrist up 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.349
 and the forearm 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 one is crowded 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.230
 and also the burden on the index finger is very big 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.439
 Herrmann with year 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 everyone executes 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.899
 when using it is not such graphics tablets you have the same night 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.729
 Saint not man has instead deposits from visit one 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.740
 the hand posture 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.360
 is to write the wall as normal 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 so is not twisted under Arntz 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 and also the wrist is not clarified 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.720
 Visi Inc 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.920
 The mouse pointer also moves while moving the pen 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.990
 You have to do this the pin up to three millimeters over this pipe surface 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.590
 receive 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590
 the mouse pointer moves 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 Surface occurs 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.150
 for Klopp 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 one clicks out 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 wohn Licht goes to the configuration program 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 to after 9 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.800
 those are way here these two buttons that could still collapse here 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.260
 be placed visual 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.280
 now it is like that with me 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.570
 lower that the lower button 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.220
 and that lasts hold 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.150
 in order to 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.570
 and the upper class so that you can right-click 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.289
 Euro on the far tablet 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.510
 can these 4 buttons 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.539
 individually 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.140
 Competitor function 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.520
 be occupied 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 this day nice here 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.660
 in the middle 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
 with that one can rumble or zoom 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.979
 it is Hirtz 2 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:03.899
 Moody 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.880
 once the mouse Mus 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.869
 Deetz is currently active 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.380
 or the pen mode 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.389
 when off mode it is like that 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.819
 the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.659
 That is, the positioning around the tablet works like a mouse 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.609
 relative 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.569
 I have to move here now 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.259
 heels 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.050
 drive diagonally upwards 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.900
 that weighs 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.789
 the mouse 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.149
 or the mouse does not jump afterwards 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.149
 which I now in the pen mode 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.389
 really will 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.150
 this talent one on one 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.759
 transmit the screen 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.579
 who does not settle 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.569
 and John approaches again he also jumps the mouse pointer immediately to the screen 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.229
 that for sure 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.169
 the back on it 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.429
 who jumps to the top left 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:52.939
 this is a yes I am the same positioning possible that 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.159
 The pen bonus is actually quite enjoyable 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.609
 also has the further advantage of the mandate 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.099
 the inscription can last longer on the field and then would 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.719
 it is done that is with the 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.349
 Mouse mode 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.349
 not really 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.029
 you can still tackle 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.799
 like the screen on it should be my case like here two 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.690
 screens 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.459
 connected and for the first time since the first resolution but this can be 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.919
 really free to configure you can also use the area of 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.219
 when adjusting so that's him 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.119
 that you are very flexible 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.359
 later open again from moss 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.069
 because in the pen Motors 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.200
 unfortunately not a bit more 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.940
 the llama in the middle area works that one then 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:44.829
 always on this 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.539
 Edge lies 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.679
 then again to the right, then it's about open again 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.369
 the 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.969
 but you take her middle range works 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.969
 then you always have the palm of your hand 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.419
 this one can fly what I do not like that 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.529
 pleasant 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.009
 Lieberman from Moers works 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.069
 when then they have to lie down 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.099
 or at least 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.179
 completely on it 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.399
 and thanks to their upper left area works and then settle by as well 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.619
 longer distances with the mouse pointer 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 while can cover 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.370
 if you do not between them 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.969
 around 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.189
 with the draw here with 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.189
 work after the pen then there are still so handy pen holder 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.919
 Rheinstetten can 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.289
 already denied the normal - operation 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.749
 very easy in how to get in and out of party 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:41.960
 continue 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.090
 Another feature is 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.099
 with forced graphics tablet of course 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.099
 should you go into such a degree editing program 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.879
 the mandate in the evening, the men from 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.830
 The men's selection also does not work so well 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.139
 if you are here now 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.909
 in Stetten w he already makes hyphens and if I put dollars on it 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.909
 Pusher makes thick strokes so neither the name can 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.409
 he can with his 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.139
 with a graphic artist Blatter 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.139
 very nice things 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.030
 from the Adamo mix 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.349
 Contemplating names gives a lot of positive points which surely already 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.650
 initially also counted 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.710
 m this natural 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.010
 That means holding your arm 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.699
 so it does not 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.800
 one turned 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.960
 and it will be 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.099
 You can also turn your mouse clicks, for example 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.319
 different muscles - Valve entire arm 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.380
 is used and not even a finger the Valencianer normal failed 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.919
 and also up to the tent suitable for right and left-handers 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.470
 no problem 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.479
 who works in such an image editing program anyway 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.360
 the EM is that 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.800
 He was followed very much by him 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.029
 practically 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.119
 However, I also see a few disadvantages 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.710
 is equipped by this heathen 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.479
 over 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.749
 the area 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.050
 you actually have a constant slight base tension in your forearm 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.889
 which may not feel so pleasant of course 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.599
 put the pen more and more 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.729
 but if in between 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.889
 you just do not do it 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.379
 and then the chip was called again and then grief imprisonment 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:34.490
 the burden is on 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.639
 the addressed Kant uses it here in the use 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.639
 not so good for me 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.699
 who's much anyway 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.699
 Of course, having m writing there naturally has such a double burden 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.849
 then exactly 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.740
 Write attitude 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.150
 it says my conclusion is 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.919
 4 people who work with image editing programs so 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.589
 absolute buy recommendation 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.460
 and it can be a lot more relaxed to work with it 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.749
 against with a mouse not at all 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.800
 compared to a normal house visited 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.119
 also advantages 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.859
 However, I can find an ergonomically shaped mouse that is 

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:16.439
 a house 

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.630
 where I put my hand up 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.580
 can insert so diagonally 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.870
 and for me a little more pleasant because then 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.210
 has no tension 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.169
 if only your hand 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.199
 m there has the leagues 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.119
 how the team does the play "The case is holding a pen 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.759
 and that you always 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.180
 slight tension 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.770
 Emmeram feels 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.520
 And so an ergonomic mouse can be used, for example, with an express 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.419
 program 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.789
 in addition to that one with not even more 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.370
 Mouse has to perform clicks 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.970
 they will be automatic
