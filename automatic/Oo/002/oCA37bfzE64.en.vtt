00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.929
 well then now determine to eliminate 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:14.299
 now so if I go back we're going 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:17.200
 to see where I'm going to my house or I 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.360
 I'll keep looking 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.950
 one of my house in the end I'm going to 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.290
 address everything I have diamonds 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.860
 all that I found that is not the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.860
 problem 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.650
 but 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.250
 in another video tutorial of minecraft xbox 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.650
 360 playstation3 for how to do 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.059
 stairs stairs talking or stairs 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.739
 who speak or do not know how you 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.270
 want to call as you realized in 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.400
 the introduction simply comes mine 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.710
 some good things in fact ends a 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.059
 thing and then I said that I was going not in the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.579
 way back I found two 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.460
 roads what was or not to go to me to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.440
 the mine and one to go to the house so 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.420
 what everything is teaching today is how 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.860
 do so that these stairs like that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.200
 have text you realize you have 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.869
 as a type of text that stands out and what 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.190
 which does not indicate where we have to go if 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.960
 we want to go to the mine because we see each other 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.090
 this way and if we want to go home 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.950
 we also go down this road I do not know 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 what will I use it for, since it is already 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.270
 question of imagination and then on how 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.890
 you are going to use it, I would use it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.979
 all for this for the house the mine or 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 to go to although scarce and how it is 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.479
 this 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.799
 it's farm but then you can only 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.020
 put four letters which is a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.520
 disadvantage but good so good without 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.430
 nothing more to say we go with the tutorial 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.369
 the materials that they will need are 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.950
 the building block of your choice 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.810
 stairs any kind of stairs 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.450
 slab is very optional indeed it is something 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.090
 optional things and points one or two 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 it is well number in fact one this now 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 what I do not know is the following, not what 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 let's just do not put a 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.220
 exit of stairs and normal not of the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 height they want, I will not do it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.659
 so high but I can just go to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.020
 put a staircase exit not so high 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.850
 why 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.230
 because this is good to do the example and 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.760
 Nothing more I'll make four or 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.160
 five I do not know with everything I did right now 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.110
 but we're going to leave a space between 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.300
 each of these in the center and you give 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.250
 realize that you will have something like this now 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200
 what you do is that you're going to put a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 block starting here and then you're going to go 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.120
 going up and up and so not so that 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.200
 one block up on each stair 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.820
 so now you decide where you want to go 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.790
 poster for example I'm going to put it here 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.520
 in the second staircase you are going to remove this 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.160
 block the support that the one who is 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.900
 between the stairs that you want to put your 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.450
 put poster not what you're going to do is 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.340
 that you are going to leave this hole because 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 the stairs that you want to put you going to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.710
 put a sign or a poster and you go to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 put the following not in my case I'm going to 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.230
 put that I tell you the same house and look no 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.200
 there are points that speak celestial thing you're going to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.910
 put on it since it starts with being the house 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.620
 or indeed if it does it backwards then 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.750
 there you have to see how you do it because 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.730
 would be mine first and home after 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.800
 because already there as you want, I'm going to 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.100
 make house and mine the point is that I put 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.730
 a c 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.890
 twice to rt use in xbox 360 in 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.690
 playstation I do not know what the wave would be like 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.940
 but then this little symbol has to be 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.380
 and I 'm going to put the first three 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.300
 papers for until I get to the top 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.970
 once you get to the top what are you going 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.280
 to do is to press again r you're going to 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.930
 press x which is to erase what 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.570
 town that just put on playstation 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.570
 like this one when you get the top you erase 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.630
 the last title is like that we're going to say 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.700
 chirolo and you're going to put the initial of the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.380
 next word you want to put in 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.760
 my case would be m because it starts at 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.380
 combine and then we're going to do 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.720
 exactly the same in the part of 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.140
 down in this case how would it be home we go 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.090
 to put a c to arrive by the us 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.400
 we take when we get to the top we erase 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.610
 the last one and we put now the and that would be 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.350
 mine with the already valid and not and then we 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.760
 let's go like this consecutively up 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.220
 fill then the word we want 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.920
 do we can not again the s since 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.840
 touch house then now let's put the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.780
 Y 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.049
 well and then I just finished it 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.459
 with one another time and the two horns of 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.959
 done the two end with the then 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.630
 let's see we finish 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.300
 and we put and ready you realize that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.490
 now it is highlighted that as a 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.410
 result of this you realize that as 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.479
 that the letters leave the poster and 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.310
 it's like a small bug that we're going to 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.289
 take advantage of points that we are now going to 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.660
 put whatever was the blocks and ready 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.220
 it is already done in fact this 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.780
 Very simple tutorial and very easy to do 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.630
 you will realize that it is too much 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.150
 you just have to put it then lyrics 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.550
 and it's for pissing those things and I know that 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.860
 there will be but to identify mine house 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.590
 home or armilla what you want in fact and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.870
 of your decision and choice and so that 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.389
 things not just the mere rozas 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800
 it can be an object of decoration then to 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.710
 sometimes I use it to decorate so that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.680
 stay as leveled or do not know no of 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.300
 done I would use the slabs but then here 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.220
 in this I think that in this example I do not know 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.050
 can and then you can decorate it as 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.330
 you want your stairs is your world 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.039
 your imagination because of the string 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.169
 as you want if you want you can put 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.120
 walls and so it is not so good not 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.220
 since this world she put you decide 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.780
 what to do with him and he is a very tutor 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.340
 easy the truth to start if you're 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.289
 starting there minecraft and then you 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.880
 you confuse every time in which way and the 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.350
 path 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.870
 well I recommend this tutorial a lot 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.390
 since it's good to do it in your world since 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.040
 It helps you a little to recognize which way 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.330
 is which although after a while already you 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.250
 we are going to learn it and we are not going to 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.730
 need so good you realize 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.910
 the text emphasizes more on in 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.980
 next on the quartz stairs you 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.110
 realize that as it is white with black 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.300
 it stands out not here on this side also 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.900
 highlights in fact the mine highlights more and 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.050
 I actually got my self and have united in 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.150
 good game because yes because I put mine 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.190
 although it seals mine in this case I'm sorry 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.260
 for that serious error but the point is that 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.450
 have understood the idea so good 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.190
 gentlemen is basically all of the cnecc 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.650
 if you liked the video if it served you this 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.880
 for this tutorial for your world comments 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.440
 because there are things you have some doubt 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.330
 you know it's a book in the comments 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.460
 where we separate videos like this one if 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.170
 the facts as well as the free smn efe 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.170
 Well not all and until next time
