the<00:00:38.629> song<00:00:38.809> I'm<00:00:38.930> going<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.079> play<00:00:39.140> for<00:00:39.289> you<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:40.059> by

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
the song I'm going to play for you is by

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.299 
the song I'm going to play for you is by
Morgoth<00:00:41.600> probably<00:00:42.379> not<00:00:42.530> as<00:00:42.680> well-known<00:00:42.859> today

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
Morgoth probably not as well-known today

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.610 
Morgoth probably not as well-known today
but<00:00:43.609> you<00:00:43.909> know<00:00:43.969> they<00:00:44.120> were<00:00:44.149> I<00:00:44.510> think<00:00:44.839> came<00:00:45.469> out

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
but you know they were I think came out

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.799 
but you know they were I think came out
around<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.070> start<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.089> death<00:00:47.629> metal

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
around the start of the death metal

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.399 
around the start of the death metal
scene<00:00:48.079> down<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.379> Florida<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:51.110> song<00:00:51.289> I'm

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
scene down in Florida and the song I'm

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.560 
scene down in Florida and the song I'm
gonna<00:00:51.559> play<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.010> isolated<00:00:52.610> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
gonna play for you is isolated the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.750 
gonna play for you is isolated the
tuning<00:00:54.110> I<00:00:54.170> think<00:00:54.409> is<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:54.890> C<00:00:55.100> tuning<00:00:55.339> on<00:00:55.579> app

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
tuning I think is the C tuning on app

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.910 
tuning I think is the C tuning on app
but<00:00:56.030> with<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.539> Floyd<00:00:56.960> Rose<00:00:57.170> tremolo<00:00:57.500> on<00:00:57.739> this

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
but with the Floyd Rose tremolo on this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.579 
but with the Floyd Rose tremolo on this
it's<00:00:58.670> difficult<00:00:59.000> for<00:00:59.539> me<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.719> just<00:01:00.170> change

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
it's difficult for me to just change

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.590 
it's difficult for me to just change
that<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.489> I'm<00:01:01.640> gonna<00:01:01.760> play<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.149> for<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.420> and
