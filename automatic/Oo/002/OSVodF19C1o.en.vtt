 the vegetable of the Incas the dad of the Incas 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.970

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.200
 right away it was called batata la

 plant known a lot of success she 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 disseminated throughout Europe and 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 France we stay at a little bit 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 skeptical about this Solanaceae 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.910
 it was called the pub and Maurelle reuze 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.479
 until louis amedee strawberries on 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.450
 famous strawberry trees and zte hare discover 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.700
 chili strawberries with big fruits and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.649
 call our potatoes apples 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 earth we were then in 1716 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.459
 3 saying tells us the ideal period 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.799
 to plant the potatoes first 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.319
 we say planting potatoes at 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.780
 moment when the lilac flowers are said also 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.019
 planted potatoes at 10 singles 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.760
 the March 29 killing will harvest by 10 or at 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.579
 their complaint the potatoes to the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.859
 Saint-Anselme April 21st you will have 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.230
 a whole art m so be careful it takes 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.819
 use of the selected plan we 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 let's see this in detail 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.129
 we could perfectly use 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.480
 tubers of consumption for the 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.939
 planting but I do not recommend it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.200
 formally this is the best way to 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.220
 transmit all diseases 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.389
 possible and imaginable 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.340
 so you will go to your 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.739
 garden center and choose apple plan 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.260
 of land that you will recognize at this 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.480
 blue label that comes from the soc is to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.220
 say the official service of control and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.680
 which guarantees you that these plans are 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.010
 completely unscathed from any 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.049
 phytosanitary disease you have two 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.099
 categories of possible care plans 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.269
 classic plans that are not sprouted there 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.239
 we'll have to make them sprout 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.780
 for 4 to 5 weeks at 5.7 degrees in 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.879
 The cave 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.190
 so that's really for crops 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.629
 the later ones on the other hand you 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.569
 find in the trade in the form of 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.519
 picking up plans already gernez they have 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.419
 this little I like indispensable to the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.419
 success of your culture 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.690
 the potato enjoyed a soil 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.220
 deep rich well before departure too much 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.080
 organic materials nida zone because 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.950
 otherwise we have mostly foliage and that 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.200
 attracts mildew 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.510
 we will have a little h at the rate of 6 and 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.530
 half and we're going to plant our apples 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.300
 ground row distant 60 cm the row 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.160
 preceding being here so 60 cm and I 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.350
 I will plant my body of water 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:06.030
 a scene so you can trace the 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.030
 TV department told us 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.269
 the potatoes is planting about 8 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.400
 10 cm deep 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.930
 we are going to use the hoe with this 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.260
 language that gives us the right 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.820
 depth and pulling along our 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.800
 body of water we do what we call 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.800
 so a ray simply a sign 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.780
 his land diploma it's this pass of 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.400
 30 to 40 cm on the row to arrange them 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.290
 in a very regular way we will use 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.690
 a professional tricks 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.250
 make a small freelance then with a 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.130
 piece of bamboo 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.650
 we will take 30 cm and then we will cut 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.170
 this piece to 30 cm then it will suffice 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.080
 of spacing each plane with this piece of 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.610
 wood 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.440
 it is very important to have your 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.140
 plans so that the little ones 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.240
 germs either upwards so let's go them 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.060
 place in the soil very 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.630
 cautious then our little 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.630
 freelance again a small plan 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.140
 the potato is a plant of the 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.330
 solanaceous family in this she is 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.520
 cousin of the aubergine peppers 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.780
 tomatoes but also maurels and so 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.760
 all those plants that can have a 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.710
 true toxicity because all 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.390
 green parts of the potato 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.900
 contain only one to ninh 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.700
 that's why we're going to pop the base of 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.100
 the potato that is to say bring back 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.870
 light soil at the foot regularly 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.520
 as it develops 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.410
 because all the green parts of the 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.380
 tuber should not be 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.910
 consumed by their southern origins 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.560
 American potatoes are 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.850
 chilly plants they do not have to 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.670
 to be put in the ground before the 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.130
 soil temperature is reached 10 degrees 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.890
 however, they can be grown in a greenhouse 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.230
 like here this crop was planted late 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.110
 January and the harvest can be done 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.470
 from the end of April it is the variety syrte 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.420
 and maquis one of the earliest between 85 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.850
 and 90 days of culture are enough for him 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.370
 to optimize the occupation of the land 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.300
 we can associate the potato with 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.310
 other vegetables 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.980
 she gets along very well with radishes 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.170
 for example salads but also 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.390
 cabbages and all legumes this is at 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.760
 to say beans peas and beans 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.060
 however she does not like the closeness 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.650
 sunflowers beetroot 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.080
 plants of his family so tomatoes 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.630
 peppers aubergines and also 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.710
 cucurbitaceae melons squash 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.710
 as well as pumpkins 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.430
 the potato is a vegetable of 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.840
 very easy culture and who 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.169
 practically succeeds in all 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.629
 regions 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.919
 so why not hesitate to cultivate 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.360
 you even your potatoes this 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.749
 may require some oil from 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.789
 elbow 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:04.349
 but why is a couch potato 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:13.310
 while it can be grown in the garden 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:13.310
 popes at the club 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.090
 Villaverde Olonne on sea you 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.189
 presented secret villaverde garden 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.430
 really really full gardener 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.430
 ideas
