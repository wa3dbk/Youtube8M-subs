00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Honey is one of my favorite ingredients 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.990
 if i have any recipes myself 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.540
 if I touch something myself 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.980
 facial masks or peelings something 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.280
 for the hair and as in the title 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.400
 read could you it's time to first 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.680
 natural hair lightening so habib 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.680
 why honey is suitable for honey 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.609
 very good of the natural 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 Hydrogen peroxide is formed and the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 you may know as whitening 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 medium from tooth whitening or off 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 blockages and that makes the honey 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.329
 a natural hair on mistake and it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 really would have with dark hair 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.700
 can you some some gradually higher 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.820
 so you can go your hair very much 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 strong on falls so I think so 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 Now two prescription will be the first recipe 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 do you need of course honey then a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.920
 empty container there I have now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 Just a jam jar 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 Washed out, you take something 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 olive oil or another oil what you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 you just want to choose to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.030
 Example man 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.080
 and half a banana does something 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.670
 honey in the glass 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.040
 to you go when a shot olive oil 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.420
 for the care and again extra care 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.310
 then gives half the banana 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.660
 the whole thing must be well prospered because 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.040
 the banana pieces otherwise later 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.860
 to hang hair then you have 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.540
 this viscous 3d about ten me 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.010
 let it soak for 15 minutes 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.440
 the ingredients and connect 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.940
 after ten to fifteen minutes you can do that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.590
 all on dry your hair on 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.210
 best carry without product in the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.840
 Feel better with hands 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.110
 have a shower on the head by 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.520
 from a hood on the head on 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.800
 best after a towel over can 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 you all about 30 to 40 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.229
 minutes a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.750
 you 'll be about three to three 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.399
 four five applications already clear 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.170
 lightening is the effort it is one 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.759
 very school year brighten up by that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.060
 the honey views nourishing effect 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:02:00.070
 has strengthened olive oil that's okay 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.190
 the best method for the second method 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 Do you need the last glass of honey? 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.310
 you stir all of that with yours 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.049
 favorite condition on yours 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.440
 favorite games that then replaces the 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.550
 Nourishing effect of olive oil 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 So the second is the simpler one 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.250
 Method The load is just as long 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.260
 I take 30 to 40 minutes to work 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.650
 40 minutes guess if the very clear 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.330
 I'm okay that's the two methods that 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
 Natural hair lighteners are her 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.160
 will see it becomes real and before 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.870
 All summer it is worthwhile if you 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 the mixture then in the summer on the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.780
 order hair then I have the sun 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.070
 and the whole thing works the better 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.930
 i do not like to use it for that 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.840
 hair but also for the skin is there 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.450
 contains my natural bleach 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.590
 one can therefore currently in its evening 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.320
 maybe that knows this dark one 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 stains that remain vistas or 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.250
 just darker skin areas to 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.220
 elbows or at the clinics times her 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.440
 something like that or for example on the back where 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.510
 the skin is particularly firm there you can 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.120
 Help with honey and if you are 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.910
 once a topic I like to take 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.310
 the honey all of me with some oil ever 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.990
 After how dry my skin is to it 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.540
 then comes red juice 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.950
 intensifies this brightening again dissolves 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.670
 Dead skin flakes through the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.860
 acid and as a scrub then stuff me 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.550
 brown sugar all mixed together and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.320
 in an empty glass as always trucks 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.830
 on the skin on what is here careful 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.700
 on 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.440
 and act on it all for a short time 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.910
 normal game has the dead 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.790
 skin cells are rubbed by 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.170
 honey has one at the same time 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.820
 antibacterial effect was quite good 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.010
 against pimples is and also for prevention 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.530
 against new pimples and wound healing 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.590
 especially good that soothes the skin and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.060
 Provides them with moisture ever said 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.739
 after how dry it is when my skin 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.739
 he dry skin is more 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.209
 olive oil lemon juice on my skin 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.120
 finished is something more 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.080
 Lemon juice as olive oil 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.420
 alternatively you can do exactly the same 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.440
 also make mixing easy as a mask 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.769
 I will again and honey some oil and 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.269
 The lemon juice mix the whole 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.370
 amount often in the face to normal 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:18.600
 Mass would then be after ten minutes and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.500
 The third thing I like to live in 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.229
 Actually, really just become just 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.870
 a pimple is there you can honey 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.100
 Just apply it and put it on 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.630
 leave a little bit of that and that 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.039
 Relieves the inflammation is a bit 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.020
 it does not go away it is not 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.220
 miracle remedy but that diminishes 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.169
 any case that it gets worse though 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.060
 Someone has an inflammation somewhere 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.160
 have problems in winter, for example 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.140
 if they had a cold, it's over here 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.450
 the nose red because you can get some honey 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.140
 maybe take some effort too 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.410
 the whole one 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.020
 that is short acting could take off then 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.660
 and all of this relieves this inflammation 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.840
 and these dry red ones are there 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.820
 the nose around 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.280
 Lastly, I use the honey 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.229
 also like for the lips that the one 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.510
 very very nice scrub based 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.529
 super soft honey with some women 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.759
 Sugar simply mixes in the middle 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:13.819
 massage in play or as a kind 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.289
 simply entered into mask for the lips 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.739
 bit of honey on the finger on the 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.599
 Lubricate lips and if you like it 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:24.199
 you can just leave it out or just 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.119
 Wipe and be awesome in Athens because that 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.949

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.139
 do so much with it and maybe also 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.329
