00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
old and I'm diabetic so my circulation

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.140 
old and I'm diabetic so my circulation
isn't<00:03:03.599> as<00:03:03.690> good<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.709> was<00:03:04.950> 40<00:03:05.459> years<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.940> mean

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
isn't as good if I was 40 years I mean

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.869 
isn't as good if I was 40 years I mean
if<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.420> was<00:03:06.450> only<00:03:06.810> 40<00:03:07.260> 20<00:03:08.069> years<00:03:08.280> younger<00:03:08.579> I

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
if I was only 40 20 years younger I

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.580 
if I was only 40 20 years younger I
might<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> totally<00:03:09.959> different<00:03:10.290> outlook

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
might have a totally different outlook

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.589 
might have a totally different outlook
on<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.920> it's<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.280> definitely<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:12.060> personal

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
on it it's a definitely a personal

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.629 
on it it's a definitely a personal
preference<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:14.069> problem<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
preference and that's the problem that

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.610 
preference and that's the problem that
I've<00:03:14.790> had<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.239> I've<00:03:15.629> talked<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> few<00:03:16.379> other

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
I've had and I've talked to a few other

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.319 
I've had and I've talked to a few other
people<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.069> own<00:03:17.250> them<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.579> they've<00:03:18.090> all

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
people that own them and they've all

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.539 
people that own them and they've all
backed<00:03:19.109> me<00:03:19.319> up<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.590> said<00:03:19.739> yes<00:03:19.949> it<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.340> some

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
backed me up and said yes it to some

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.670 
backed me up and said yes it to some
degree<00:03:21.889> that<00:03:22.889> is<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:24.359> only<00:03:25.139> point<00:03:25.410> about

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
degree that is the the only point about

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.129 
degree that is the the only point about
this<00:03:25.949> war<00:03:26.190> bonnet<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:26.910> would<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.930> negative

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
this war bonnet that would be negative

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.759 
this war bonnet that would be negative
and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.579> probably<00:03:30.169> true<00:03:31.169> of<00:03:31.230> most

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
and I think that's probably true of most

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.520 
and I think that's probably true of most
hammocks<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.699> lay<00:03:32.849> in<00:03:33.030> diagonally<00:03:33.780> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
hammocks that you lay in diagonally so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.220 
hammocks that you lay in diagonally so
rather<00:03:35.250> than<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.879> live<00:03:36.209> with<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.419> I'm<00:03:36.810> going

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
rather than just live with it I'm going

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.409 
rather than just live with it I'm going
to<00:03:37.349> try<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.709> go<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.099> bridge<00:03:38.370> hammock<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.940> see

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
to try to go to a bridge hammock and see

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.750 
to try to go to a bridge hammock and see
if<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.599> can't<00:03:39.870> completely<00:03:40.470> eliminate<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.220> but

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
if I can't completely eliminate it but

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.569 
if I can't completely eliminate it but
I'm<00:03:41.879> sure<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.480> bridge<00:03:42.599> hammock<00:03:43.139> will

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
I'm sure that the bridge hammock will

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'm sure that the bridge hammock will
come<00:03:44.579> up<00:03:44.699> with<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.910> whole<00:03:44.940> new<00:03:45.090> set<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.540> problems

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
come up with a whole new set of problems

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.860 
come up with a whole new set of problems
that<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.590> hadn't<00:03:47.099> foreseen<00:03:47.669> hammocks<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.840> a

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
that I hadn't foreseen hammocks have a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.500 
that I hadn't foreseen hammocks have a
way<00:03:49.109> of<00:03:49.579> letting<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.819> know<00:03:51.030> things<00:03:51.359> about

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
way of letting you know things about

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.089 
way of letting you know things about
