 I will show no recipes I want 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.970
 make a review of such a slow cooker from 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.460
 philips 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.110
 This is a compact multicooker avance 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:23.110
 breakfast collection this multicooker 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.140
 did not provide the manufacturer for the test 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.150
 This model of multicooker is brand new. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.850
 went on sale only recently in 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.179
 April so far I managed to cook in 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.120
 the slow cooker 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.519
 the recipe I'll also be sure to show well 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.030
 And now I will tell about this multicooker 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.940
 Here is the box that was 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.339
 packed this multicooker to be honest 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.429
 when i saw this box i decided that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.519
 the slow cooker is definitely not a compact school 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.049
 big box actually 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.370

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.579

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850
 colors 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.980
 I can only say that black 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 color is one of the drawbacks 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.780
 this multicooker 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.110
 Not only that she is black, she is also so 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 glossy it creeps up dust 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.070
 any speck of dust can be seen immediately in general 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 you need to constantly and wipe it 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 looked beautiful and glistened 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.670
 the multicooker opens at the touch of a button 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 very easy 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.369
 Immediately visible all the dust particles of the multicooker bowl 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.759

 it can cook almost any 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.050
 dishes thanks to the fact that there is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.119
 manual mode that is possible 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.820

 initially stage 2 hours you can already give 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.829

 cap against boiling different 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.609

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.139
 plus because you do not have to steam 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.450
 with washing multicooker 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.040
 in my previous multicooker inner 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 the cap was not removed 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.319
 and we found this lid difficult for you 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.040
 washing is very easy with 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.099
 multicooker 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.099

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.560
 cups are really cool on them 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.569

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.790
 always know when your image 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.780

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.780
 case you need to eat 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.390
 the glass is thick enough that is 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.250
 strong strong jars it is very me 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.299
 I liked it with the slow cooker 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.750
 Here is a book of recipes recipes 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.019
 There are many interesting recipes here. 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.780
 most of them are not vegan 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.810
 so if you are vegan and purchase this 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.859
 Multicooker recipes will have to 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.440
 adapt or come up with 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.419
 strongly here at the end of the little book 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.419
 there is a page for notes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.960
 it also shows the parameters of the modes 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.930
 multicookers and what temperature is indicated 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.539
 set by default and what time 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.419
 set to default for various 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.979
 programs included with the slow cooker 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.130
 Here is a power cord 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.620
 I measured its length, it makes 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.750
 meter-twenty 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.419
 In general, this is quite a length, but I would 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.580
 preferred over longer and about centimeters at 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.979
