00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 Shenzhen Hartz Chapter 3 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 a lawyer stops 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.020
 Compare Sebastian Nicolas 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.669
 for centuries he has come close to the souls of men 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.910
 sometimes he poisoned the human mind to get his e-mails 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.880
 but sometimes the mind of a man was already by other circumstances 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 so affected that on a topic invited 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.489
 that was what Shell Dances meant 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.899
 At the bottom of his grief the boy had only hatred 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.820
 and contempt hours 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.080
 a beautiful apple for a demon 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 The castle had at the same time known to use 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.120
 and it has not been long since been in the human world 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.660
 I like the game because of the game the gamer wants the boy in the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.140
 Act implemented 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.560
 if there were some in the right he hated 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.220
 he would ever get the man to taste the tastiest 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.660
 but it was not just that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.989
 in the soul their greatest desire 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.300
 unless born of a negative feelings 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.830
 to be revealed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030
 Certainly not to be more written 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.229
 so he has taken on his job as a partner since counts and had with 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.290
 By the time this boy meets no team through and through 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.810
 and yet it succeeds even after seven years in sometimes too 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 to surprise 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.930
 There were situations in which she had already been sure 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.150
 the hearing with someone had compassion 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.490
 Now immediately convinced of the opposite 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
 and then the boy showed honest feelings where he always used to 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.560
 was closed 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.030
 in March more people spent 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 Yesterday he became aware that he was actually in the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.070
 Inside and asked each other time after time 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 whether it is right for a person to be cold 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.770
 Sebastien smiles and looks out to the slender boy in the opposite 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.740
 Carriage was sitting 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.710
 and start blankly out of the window 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.719
 Annual normal MQ dating b-teenager was so low-emotional 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.420
 with so little feeling now but again thought the butler targeted 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.829
 the situation in the bathroom can be remembered 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.529
 she clearly could have been more nervous and how responsive 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.670
 that was nothing unusual in itself 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.859
 At this age, people were often determined by their drives 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.609
 can feel their feelings they loved each other 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.620
 but she has never shown such an interest in women 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.319
 Maybe that's not what Bastian thought I was the first one 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.189
 times 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 possibly the young Jan found more pleasing 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.030
 but even if it were 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.579
 Goals would never admit it 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.870
 a reporter to pretend something to other people 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.549
 she does not let his true feelings sing 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.920
 but Sebastien was not a human and he noticed quite well 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.579
 Emotions Weinzierl 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.339
 if he still could not always interpret them 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.389
 In that case, he would just have to wait a bit 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.900
 maybe he would play a bit with counting as well to the tank 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.319
 scratch the feelings they have about dyers 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.859
 a dark grin scurries e-bass Bastion's face as Johann Wachtel what 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.549
 All this for options gave a lot of confusion 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.169
 Nevertheless, do not switch immediately afterwards 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.589
 With what's going on with her, there's no case to come to work on 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.539
 are really dangerous here 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.100
 I also had out the window 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.529
 Hazares almost arrived at their destination 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.719
 his army and he has few words of agreement needed they were one 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.819
 well-rehearsed team when it came to solve murder cases 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.590
 after the coach stopped in front of a gray building 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.370
 he pleaded for the car door Stieghorst out and held him the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.129
 handcuffs 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.529
 then to help you with scarcely steep steps 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.199
 even at this simple step a thousand times repeated the list 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.649
 latest Bastian the TIG Themis younger easy to crack 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.519
 Kauder arrived downstairs, he let go of the hand immediately and money 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.579
 Without hesitating on the door of the house to Sebastien slaves one would have 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.349
 heavy steps and then over the door of an enlightened the boy 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.409
 Man opened 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.409
 I'm so glad to see a lot here at home 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.030
 I need time but Lyon with buses face and wanted to crack the hand it 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.900
 pack 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.400
 However, with a short reply it went big 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.240
 Outlander standing at his table, bent over various documents 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.159
 he looked as those approached his companion 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.319
 immediately charter the corporation is brave 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.380
 he had never liked the boy 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.010
 but now, by those slowly growing up, he had to be in the due 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.479
 Show respect 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.530
 As FMC unit he said with a nod and extended his right hand out 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.080
 she seized this only for a brief moment, a Reiner courtesy said 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.039
 Sebastien smirked 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.600
 Being different would also have the touch of strangers 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.719
 and also that of his partner responded 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.599
 He would keep an eye on this 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.149
 she received the commissioner's letter with the seal of the queen under her nose 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.830
 Her Majesty wants that case to attract as little attention as possible 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.840
 that means the killers are getting their hands on it as fast as possible 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.720
 they will meditate for necessary information 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.669
 Sebastien had already picked up paper and pencil but loud Landis had 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.099
 not much to say 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.830
 Scotland yard mostly not much more seen three young men 2 18 others 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.030
 20 years old 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.030
 Further data on the persons may not be the goal is the further questions 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.300
 they were all newlywed cause of death every time I was a sting 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.800
 to the heart 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.680
 what about the crime scenes? 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.870
 there is no identifiable pattern Giorgi Schein also randomly chose the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.479
 Departure except for those already mentioned no further similarities 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.310
 Sebastien smiled because he felt that there as always 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.419
 did not say everything 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.039
 but he at CL knew very well that the Ticker Teague Commissioner init everything 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.169
 revealed and it did not bring the man on to booty 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.440
 a good day she was annoyed to go ignoring the friendly look 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.580
 from Orwell and got back into the groats 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.970
 except that Sheen's lawyer Soli and the coachman brought his strength to 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.789
 carry 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.789
 It went straight across the city I stopped then 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.550
 she creates the deep 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.449
 The yes-word every time have to go back here 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.589
 I think I should someday put a new informant 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.919
 It's not a big deal 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.139
 if it's the city i can go in alone and have all the necessary experience 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.139
 bring 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.360
 in the alley Sebastien obliging this was already up and 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.389
 Together they finally left the coach at one 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.990
 drab buildings whose facade with a huge sign above the door 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.889
 was equipped 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.000
 which also closed the task area it homeowner
