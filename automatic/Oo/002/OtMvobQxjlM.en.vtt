they're<00:00:06.060> just<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> end<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.140> this

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
they're just about at the end of this

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.860 
they're just about at the end of this
presentation<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.309> finish<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.030> want<00:00:09.690> to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
presentation and to finish I want to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.810 
presentation and to finish I want to
talk<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> hazardous<00:00:11.099> attitudes<00:00:11.639> that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
talk about the hazardous attitudes that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.289 
talk about the hazardous attitudes that
I<00:00:11.880> promised<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.570> would<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> beginning

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
I promised I would at the beginning

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.359 
I promised I would at the beginning
studies<00:00:15.299> indicate<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.900> many<00:00:16.770> pilots<00:00:17.070> can

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
studies indicate that many pilots can

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.450 
studies indicate that many pilots can
fall<00:00:17.640> prey<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.619> one<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.890> more<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.340> these

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fall prey to one or more of these

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
fall prey to one or more of these
hazardous<00:00:21.119> attitudes<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.590> they're<00:00:22.830> kind

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
hazardous attitudes and and they're kind

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
hazardous attitudes and and they're kind
of<00:00:23.100> inherent<00:00:23.970> personality<00:00:24.420> traits<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> many

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of inherent personality traits that many

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.970 
of inherent personality traits that many
of<00:00:25.890> us<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.490> pilots<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:28.170> first<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.740> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
of us have as pilots the first one is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.299 
of us have as pilots the first one is
one<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.970> call<00:00:30.170> anti-authority<00:00:31.309> second

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
one that we call anti-authority second

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.319 
one that we call anti-authority second
one<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:33.559> impulsivity<00:00:34.880> another<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
one is impulsivity another one is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
one is impulsivity another one is
invulnerability<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.129> we've<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.430> macho<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
invulnerability then we've got macho and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.900 
invulnerability then we've got macho and
then<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.370> pilots<00:00:41.370> who<00:00:41.550> are

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
then we also have pilots who are

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.740 
then we also have pilots who are
committed<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> sense<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.379> resignation<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
committed to a sense of resignation so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.209 
committed to a sense of resignation so
let's<00:00:45.899> look<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.260> individually<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
let's look at these individually and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.880 
let's look at these individually and
then<00:00:47.489> we'll<00:00:47.610> also<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.559> antidotes<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
then we'll also think about antidotes to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
then we'll also think about antidotes to
them<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> prevent<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.960> from

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
them and how we can prevent them from

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.189 
them and how we can prevent them from
creeping<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.250> us<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.870> those<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
creeping up on us now for those of you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.180 
creeping up on us now for those of you
who<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.410> want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.890> interesting

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
who really want to do an interesting

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
who really want to do an interesting
little<00:00:56.489> exercise<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.420> figure<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.140> exactly

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
little exercise to figure out exactly

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.849 
little exercise to figure out exactly
what<00:00:59.100> type<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.699> pilot<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> tend<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.899> I'd

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
what type of a pilot you tend to be I'd

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.969 
what type of a pilot you tend to be I'd
encourage<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> hop<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:04.320> favorite

the top you'll end up with a document

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.940 
the top you'll end up with a document
that<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> quiz<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> does

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that is actually a quiz and what it does

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.219 
that is actually a quiz and what it does
is<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> puts<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> pilot<00:01:21.360> through<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is it puts you as a pilot through a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
is it puts you as a pilot through a
whole<00:01:22.650> pile<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> different<00:01:23.640> scenarios<00:01:24.140> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
whole pile of different scenarios you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
whole pile of different scenarios you
answer<00:01:25.619> them<00:01:25.799> according<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
answer them according to how you think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
answer them according to how you think
you<00:01:27.270> would<00:01:27.479> react<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> end<00:01:29.340> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you would react and then at the end you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.030 
you would react and then at the end you
can<00:01:29.790> score<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.079> they'll<00:01:31.860> give

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
can score them all up and they'll give

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
can score them all up and they'll give
you<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.579> main<00:01:33.299> type<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.079> you'll<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you a main type so you'll be one of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.580 
you a main type so you'll be one of
these<00:01:35.060> main<00:01:36.060> types<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.290> they'll<00:01:37.439> also

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
these main types here then they'll also

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.920 
these main types here then they'll also
typically<00:01:38.130> give<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> secondary<00:01:39.119> subtype

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
typically give you a secondary subtype

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.800 
typically give you a secondary subtype
as<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> might<00:01:41.430> help<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.790> analyze<00:01:42.000> as

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
as well now it might help you analyze as

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
as well now it might help you analyze as
you<00:01:43.320> decide<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.890> flying<00:01:44.840> knowing<00:01:45.840> your

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you decide on flying knowing your

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219 
you decide on flying knowing your
personal<00:01:46.860> pitfalls<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.930> let's<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
personal pitfalls so let's look at the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.510 
personal pitfalls so let's look at the
first<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.770 

well<00:01:53.520> maybe<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.149> won't<00:01:55.040> just<00:01:56.040> quickly<00:01:56.780> point

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
well maybe we won't just quickly point

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.389 
well maybe we won't just quickly point
out<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.110> slide<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.040> pretty

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
out this slide here I think it's pretty

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.889 
out this slide here I think it's pretty
much<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.759> I've<00:01:59.880> already<00:02:00.060> mentioned<00:02:00.390> pilots

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
much what I've already mentioned pilots

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
much what I've already mentioned pilots
who<00:02:00.990> learn<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> recognize<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:02.009> attitudes

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
who learn to recognize their attitudes

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.990 
who learn to recognize their attitudes
can<00:02:03.030> counteract<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:04.130> now<00:02:05.130> we'll<00:02:05.759> take<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can counteract them now we'll take a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.790 
can counteract them now we'll take a
look<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.450> some<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.020> these<00:02:07.140> individually

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
look at some of these individually

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
look at some of these individually
anti-authority<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.039> pilot<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
anti-authority a pilot like this is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
anti-authority a pilot like this is
going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.410> say

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
going to say

so<00:02:41.700> many<00:02:41.910> rules<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.079> remember

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
so many rules and we have to remember

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.270 
so many rules and we have to remember
them<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.129> have<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.549> adhere<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.420> them<00:02:45.750> all

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
but really a lot of those rules are also

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.900

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
unnecessary risks and chances that they

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.580 
unnecessary risks and chances that they
shouldn't<00:04:49.509> take<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:52.110> what<00:04:53.110> would<00:04:53.289> be<00:04:53.350> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
shouldn't take so what would be the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.779 
shouldn't take so what would be the
antidote<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.789> pilot<00:04:55.300> like<00:04:55.449> this<00:04:56.220> well<00:04:57.220> think

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
antidote to a pilot like this well think

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.480 
antidote to a pilot like this well think
this<00:04:58.330> way<00:04:58.570> think<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.770> can<00:05:00.250> happen<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.570> me

this way think it can happen to me
here's<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.580> pilot<00:05:03.940> who's<00:05:04.060> encountering<00:05:04.599> some

as just being good luck so what's the
antidote<00:07:02.880> to<00:07:03.449> er<00:07:05.000> well<00:07:07.460> in<00:07:08.460> that<00:07:08.580> case<00:07:08.780> that'd

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
antidote to er well in that case that'd

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.839 
antidote to er well in that case that'd
be<00:07:09.990> something<00:07:10.259> like<00:07:10.560> I<00:07:10.770> can<00:07:11.130> make<00:07:11.639> a

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
be something like I can make a

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.920 
be something like I can make a
difference<00:07:12.060> a<00:07:13.849> few<00:07:14.849> other<00:07:15.000> things<00:07:15.090> for<00:07:15.720> those

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930
