00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
three boots here I'm just in Brie's home

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.799 
three boots here I'm just in Brie's home
and<00:00:10.860> they<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.790> different<00:00:11.820> speed<00:00:12.389> levels

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and they all have different speed levels

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.330 
and they all have different speed levels
so<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.170> start<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.590> office<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.219> these

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so you start off with office in these

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
so you start off with office in these
boots<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.330> then<00:00:15.809> look<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.170> they

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
fastest boots can run across water so
we're<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.520> test<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.940> shit<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.809> I'll

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

we're gonna test that shit out so I'll
be<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.770> better<00:00:38.070> location<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.700> testing

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
be back in a better location for testing

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.830

this water running what is up guys here
we<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> lady<00:00:43.860> stone<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.579> figured

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we are at the lady stone just figured

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
we are at the lady stone just figured
I'd<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.329> nice<00:00:45.480> water<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.469> run<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I'd get some nice water so we can run on

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
I'd get some nice water so we can run on
it<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:48.020> I'm<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.200> sure<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.680> boots<00:00:49.920> work

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it and I'm not sure if these boots work

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.529 
it and I'm not sure if these boots work
well<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.640> encumbered<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
well over encumbered or that you have to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
well over encumbered or that you have to
reset<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.989> every<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
reset them every time but here we go I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
reset them every time but here we go I
have<00:00:53.430> number<00:00:54.420> four<00:00:54.629> boots<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
have number four boots on which is the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
have number four boots on which is the
boots<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> speed<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.750> don't<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.870> really

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
boots of speed and I don't see really

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
boots of speed and I don't see really
much<00:00:58.199> difference<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> them

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
much difference like here this is them

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.470 
much difference like here this is them
off

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
off

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
off
this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.350> now<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:01.949> here

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
this is them on now if we go into here

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
this is them on now if we go into here
and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:03.000> come<00:01:03.210> back<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.750> quicker<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and then come back I'm quicker so you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
and then come back I'm quicker so you
kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> reset<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> hard

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
kind of have to reset it it's a hard

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.210 
kind of have to reset it it's a hard
thing<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> five<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
thing because I go to five right now and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
thing because I go to five right now and
I<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.430> slower<00:01:08.729> even<00:01:09.000> though<00:01:09.479> five<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I get slower even though five is my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.179 
I get slower even though five is my
boots<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> swiftness<00:01:10.590> they're<00:01:10.950> supposed<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
boots of swiftness they're supposed to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.580 
boots of swiftness they're supposed to
be<00:01:11.280> faster<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.299> items<00:01:12.840> boom<00:01:13.380> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
be faster go to this items boom it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.929 
be faster go to this items boom it's
reset<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.340> faster<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
reset and now I'm faster than I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
reset and now I'm faster than I
originally<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> noticed
