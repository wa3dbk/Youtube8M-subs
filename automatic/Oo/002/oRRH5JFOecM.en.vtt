00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
getting there are those options to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.910 
getting there are those options to
adjust<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.269> spring<00:03:49.540> tension<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.140> think<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.709> find

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
adjust the spring tension I think I find

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.490 
adjust the spring tension I think I find
that<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.459> be<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.610> main<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.959> also<00:03:53.140> if

that to be the main one and then also if
you<00:03:53.590> use<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.769> dowel<00:03:54.040> pedal<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:54.519> important

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
you use a dowel pedal it's important

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.699 
you use a dowel pedal it's important
that<00:03:54.970> there's<00:03:55.239> room<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.570> bring<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.049> left<00:03:56.200> bass

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709

that there's room to bring the left bass
drum<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.980> slave<00:03:57.220> pedal<00:03:57.549> in<00:03:57.670> there<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.420> you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
drum a slave pedal in there and so you

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.910 
drum a slave pedal in there and so you
want<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.780> make<00:03:58.870> sure<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.140> either<00:03:59.290> two-legged

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
want to make sure it's either two-legged
