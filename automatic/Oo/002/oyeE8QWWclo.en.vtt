if<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.869> were<00:01:09.930> making<00:01:10.200> us<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
if they were making us but I like it it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
if they were making us but I like it it
slightly<00:01:11.220> changes<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> consistency<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
slightly changes the consistency of the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.870 
slightly changes the consistency of the
cucumber<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.740> little<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.340> floppy<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
cucumber to a little bit more floppy but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.149 
cucumber to a little bit more floppy but
still<00:01:15.150> bitey

down<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> cold<00:01:46.440> water<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:49.790> think

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
down with a bit of cold water I think

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.490 
down with a bit of cold water I think
for<00:01:50.940> me<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> whole<00:01:51.390> point<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.900> outdoor<00:01:52.320> eating

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
for me the whole point of outdoor eating

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
for me the whole point of outdoor eating
is<00:01:53.160> that<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.490> should<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.760> simple<00:01:54.030> everyone's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is that it should be simple everyone's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
is that it should be simple everyone's
outside<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> don't<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> be

scuttling back to the kitchen so the
idea<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.050> this<00:01:58.350> recipes<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.550> just

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
idea of this recipes is for it to just

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.250 
idea of this recipes is for it to just
be<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.480> know<00:02:00.630> stuff<00:02:00.870> that<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.110> can
