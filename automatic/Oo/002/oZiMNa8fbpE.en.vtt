00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.330
 now I 'm going to show you the 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.880
 flint working brand s 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.799
 to see how quickly it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 can make a fire 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.780
 first we must have what we are going to 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.690
 learn in this case is going to be a piece 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.450
 of sanitary paper 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.640
 It should be mentioned that it is important that 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.820
 that is going to learn must be particles 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.489
 fine debris chip dry grass 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.960
 and the other very important issue is 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.800
 it is not enough 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 making a spark with the flint is 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.170
 necessary first scrape gently 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.170
 about what we are going to burn 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.720
 to generate some dust from it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 magnesium once we've done 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.530
 enough of this what we're going to do 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.210
 is to give a spark so that this can 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.450
 ignite a spark on the material to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450
 burn 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 and there is a hotel 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.860
 Made of steel the chain saw is a 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.920
 light instrument that allows us to do 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 quick cuts on branches and trees 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 without more 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.970
 in a matter of seconds as can be seen 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.040
 here the chainsaw started doing 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.920
 the cut and the branch 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.920
 one can easily cut 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 large diameters of logs with the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.480
 chain saw 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.940
 I'm going to show you one of the legs more 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.930
 versatile and economical of the market 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.930
 warrior calf 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.560
 It has several compartments 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.220
 for example one can get here 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 comfortably 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.950
 money the close at hand 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.340
 here we have 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.250
 another bag 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.010
 and in the main compartment there is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.910
 enough space for those who do not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.570
 they come to an excursion 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.570
 we are going 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.830
 a lover of science 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.770
 chain saw 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.400
 a compass 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.080
 a fire starter 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.860
 the leg was with its tapes fits to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 what is waist 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.120
 and legs 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.530
 one can walk and do any 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.140
 activity comfortably 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.140
 carrying what one needs 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.420
 to develop 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.790
 the click snaps 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.860
 in waist and leg
