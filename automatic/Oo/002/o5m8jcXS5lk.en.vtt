think the biggest workout essential
after<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.609> workout<00:04:03.090> figuring<00:04:04.049> out<00:04:04.200> what<00:04:04.739> your

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
after you workout figuring out what your

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.849 
after you workout figuring out what your

faster<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.720> keep<00:04:09.989> up<00:04:10.140> with<00:04:10.380> all<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.590> work<00:04:10.829> you

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
faster but keep up with all the work you

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.810 
faster but keep up with all the work you
did<00:04:11.250> because<00:04:12.200> your<00:04:13.200> body<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> car<00:04:14.100> and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
did because your body is like a car and

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.390 
did because your body is like a car and
if<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.540> don't<00:04:15.720> put<00:04:15.900> gas<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.440> your<00:04:16.470> car<00:04:16.620> it's

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
if you don't put gas in your car it's

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.159 
if you don't put gas in your car it's
not<00:04:17.579> gonna<00:04:17.789> get<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.120> very<00:04:18.150> far<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.810> it's<00:04:18.930> not

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
not gonna get you very far and it's not

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.900

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
gonna run efficiently and eventually

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.580 
gonna run efficiently and eventually
it's<00:04:21.060> gonna<00:04:21.150> get<00:04:21.390> towards<00:04:21.810> just<00:04:22.019> running<00:04:22.440> on

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it's gonna get towards just running on

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.379 
it's gonna get towards just running on
fumes<00:04:23.039> like<00:04:23.460> below<00:04:23.880> E<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:25.220> after<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.400> workout

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
super long trip and then you need to

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.159 
super long trip and then you need to
figure<00:04:32.879> out<00:04:33.120> okay<00:04:33.360> where<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.719> where's<00:04:33.960> the
