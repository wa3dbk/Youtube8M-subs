 but one day 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.210
 never forgotten when li politics my sister and her boyfriend 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.839
 a friend of my sister and my brother was the bite 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.389
 who see the fun for once again see that neighborhood run out 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.949
 and those deep in the well-known trumpet ex 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.939
 at that moment 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.300
 mast a lady who clearly knocked on the window of my standing 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 so in some way you are surprised you are from 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
 I was still very different in the qualification year g 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.170
 We don't do that anyway I try forming those Altidore batteries that are on a de 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.270
 slums procedure to extra in between 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.470
 seeing young people as a kind did the hand 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.280
 that brussel 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 that has long been a striking feature 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.550
 it's you can say how nice it is you can just as well say their neighborhood with the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.460
 mother 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.959
 And that the time to have some fun it is not really necessary than men 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.910
 ideal houses more houses in nijmegen 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.890
 yes it is just a real each window has a different surprise who see 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 but I was always full of anita 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 although I always look in the kitchen I also see the people who see but always 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.910
 and say they thought 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.590
 but when I was young the city 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.819
 in the kitchen that is almost no longer just one more 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.170
 I think I have a striking application 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.560
 if i sleep a strong state so first wait until i am forever the strongest 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.620
 risers in the polder 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.180
 then you also run the installation texts and in the evening like me 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 I go goosebumps at 15 degrees 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.910
 the amount I feed them try and then he still runs around all the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.860
 third time but in the kitchen 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.510
 I tell him 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 That guy percent back 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 next to his team on a weak 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.090
 7 I am also going to hear from the customer and there and what I think is that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 officials sick i could 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.780
 we have already had that, but yes, that is typical of countering a few 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 player in texas well even then they can do more quickly 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.659
 9 is further 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.119
 It is already difficult to put the rest of us down 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.459
 sometimes also one that comes in and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 everything is perfect and with the end of 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.949
 the language are different 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.159
 the opposite why body odor that tells Jan hundreds 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.349
 hundreds of murders 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.560
 a real one which was the other who has absolutely not washed 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.899
 I think productions 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.799
 a certain albert heijn plus i stood there and now i saw several men 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.639
 waited such a look for a pat and I really stood there like a whore runner 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.109
 wait until they reach the curtain on greece 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.509
 and the pixies foundation of course but don't care about me 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.289
 not at all so naive the bid of a year light after a dirty old man I know 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.379
 a lot of traffic roll on the pumping euro so I don't think at all I just think I do 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.390
 am also such a guy for the other side but not out at the moment 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.750
 That you are capable of BP yourself is not capable 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.739
 or even forward 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.279
 that is a bit premature chess that denounces a head off 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.120
 it's not my eyes with viewers anyway 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.119
 the major concern for one of the victims of 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.769
 the device 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.849
 you have 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.409
 if she is me he is 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.439
 this is also without being 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.209
 he is now very positive 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.689
 so i guess i think but it remains open everywhere you get it all 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.430
 I make my own 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.200
 I did another boeing last time the autonomy that Zetterberg I whole 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.409
 North Holland 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.060
 I thought that I would be published to the gallery on it does not imply that 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:59.169
 that through the gate should be typical again if you want it on I have a whole 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:03:59.710
 fat 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.979
 and then you also had that very narrow one 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.549
 the reds s and there they really stood as a kind of elaborate spotters all 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.509
 has rights and his head 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:15.149
 the stab incident and the slop that succeeded on some days without a food ticket 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:18.149
 very narrow jobs 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:19.930
 such a team 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.739
 quite right 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.920
 quite a lot with his end up in that just more energy back in December 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 Every October the singer is built 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.830
 for the cloud quite a lot of plans for the fiber home barn and I went 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.469
 know to love looking to the future but just one 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.009
 what is a bottle saying you give yourself a little more all this all 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.129
 bollebakker the hand in we can each other up 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.809
 13 but the mirror on the spot 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.849
 and what is also very annoying is that people from outside 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.759
 I think I can do everything 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 you see the slopes as people 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.800
 where we come from 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.479
 already taken 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.559
 this test is that they are everywhere 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:07.740
 but places 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.699
 I walked home 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.449
 but also here of that just that image of that girl just in the 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.370
 thought and could bring it here not lost 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.550
 there was only one solution before I went back 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.430
 I later stopped even to sample what I do find in the neighborhood I 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.759
 not 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.449
 the brook 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.300
 and the managers I have known you with such a roll out after b to 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.830
 hold I parked the car further and the tour that was finished was the new station 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.279
 and I want to have him picked up 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.360
 yes i stop kinheim 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 who have made but I am grateful this year for the scarf you chose 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.050
 man who doesn't have a ball in midfield, it's all about appearance 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.789
 and nobody says 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:47.860
 just fine 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.289
 I didn't know 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.979
 I have two days here and there at Celtic 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.900
 if you are ashamed then also full 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.330
 I have not done it in my life until one moment I thought x 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.719
 I discover that more and more in life 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.909
 do you have the moment am there you go on one or nothing 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.909
 then we look smit is not going to go into it 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:12.129
 just by stepping back against he says this is just so after moment that i got there 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.129
 I was curious I wanted to know 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.360
 what is this
