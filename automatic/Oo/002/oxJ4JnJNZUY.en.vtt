the two side quests are two just to cut
off<00:03:19.799> his<00:03:19.979> tail<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.519> then<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.629> damage<00:03:22.290> his<00:03:22.440> main

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
off his tail and then to damage his main

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.559 
off his tail and then to damage his main
so<00:03:23.370> those<00:03:23.760> two<00:03:23.970> things<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.299> pretty<00:03:24.419> much

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
so those two things are pretty much

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.000 
so those two things are pretty much
always<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.139> happen<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.739> attack

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
always going to happen if you attack

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.939 
always going to happen if you attack
this<00:03:26.190> guy<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.430> right<00:03:26.729> way<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> mean

this guy the right way and what I mean

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.469 
this guy the right way and what I mean
by<00:03:29.010> attack<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.790> right<00:03:29.939> way<00:03:30.120> it's<00:03:30.359> like

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
by attack in the right way it's like

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.839 
by attack in the right way it's like
actually<00:03:31.109> meant<00:03:31.439> if<00:03:31.949> you<00:03:32.129> attack<00:03:32.459> him<00:03:32.669> the

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
actually meant if you attack him the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.849 
actually meant if you attack him the
right<00:03:33.060> way<00:03:33.090> that's<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> right<00:03:34.290> way<00:03:34.409> to<00:03:34.470> attack

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
right way that's the right way to attack

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.089 
right way that's the right way to attack
him<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.189> mean<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.060> when<00:03:36.510> he<00:03:36.769> when<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.859> first

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
does the role late move and you'll

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.119 
does the role late move and you'll
pretty<00:03:42.810> much<00:03:42.870> always<00:03:43.199> dodge<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.919> if<00:03:44.009> you're

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
wall move his tail kind of whips up in

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.020 
wall move his tail kind of whips up in
the<00:04:56.750> air<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.200> doesn't<00:04:57.470> touch<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.280> ground<00:04:58.520> so

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
the air it doesn't touch the ground so

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.090 
the air it doesn't touch the ground so
it's<00:04:59.240> safe<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.570> be<00:04:59.690> under<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.110> when<00:05:00.380> he<00:05:00.919> does

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
it's safe to be under that when he does

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.430 
it's safe to be under that when he does
that<00:05:01.130> move<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:02.180> course<00:05:02.390> it's<00:05:02.540> very<00:05:02.750> unsafe<00:05:03.260> to

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
that move of course it's very unsafe to

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.879 
that move of course it's very unsafe to
be<00:05:03.530> under<00:05:03.740> his<00:05:03.830> head<00:05:04.070> but<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:04.460> okay

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.870

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.140 
did drop something I'm going to come
back<00:05:24.180> for<00:05:24.540> it<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:25.620> saw<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.040> little<00:05:26.250> sparkly<00:05:26.910> near

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
back for it I saw a little sparkly near

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.960 
back for it I saw a little sparkly near
in<00:05:27.270> his<00:05:27.510> tail<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.770> uh<00:05:28.800> just<00:05:29.520> go<00:05:29.639> ahead<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.790> come

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
in his tail so uh just go ahead and come

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.070 
in his tail so uh just go ahead and come
out<00:05:30.090> here<00:05:30.330> there's<00:05:30.510> some<00:05:30.660> blue<00:05:30.810> draweth

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
out here there's some blue draweth

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.930 
out here there's some blue draweth
hanging<00:05:31.440> out<00:05:31.530> here<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.160> if<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.340> come<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:32.729> way

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
hanging out here so if you come this way

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.700 
hanging out here so if you come this way
normally<00:05:33.419> you'll<00:05:33.660> run<00:05:33.840> into<00:05:33.870> some<00:05:34.290> resistance

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
normally you'll run into some resistance

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.860 
normally you'll run into some resistance
so<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.639> probably<00:05:35.790> be<00:05:36.030> better<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.540> take<00:05:36.690> the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
so it's probably be better to take the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.680 
so it's probably be better to take the
shortcut<00:05:37.139> anyway<00:05:37.910> all<00:05:38.910> right<00:05:39.030> go<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.270> sharpen
