00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.080 

Roman<00:00:52.020> went<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.830> with<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> engineer<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
Roman went out with the engineer that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
Roman went out with the engineer that
helped<00:00:54.330> in<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.660> car<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.230> America<00:00:55.890> check<00:00:56.220> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
helped in this car for America check it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.660 
helped in this car for America check it
out

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
out

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450 
out
we<00:00:57.150> got<00:00:57.300> 160<00:00:57.870> horsepower<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.800> much<00:00:59.010> power<00:00:59.250> can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
we got 160 horsepower how much power can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.260 
we got 160 horsepower how much power can
you<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.730> through<00:00:59.879> those<00:01:00.000> front<00:01:00.239> wheels

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you put through those front wheels

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.420 
you put through those front wheels
before<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:00.809> gets<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.110> control<00:01:01.309> how<00:01:02.309> much

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
before it gets out of control how much

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
before it gets out of control how much
more<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> chip<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.900> I'd

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
answer to that question we played a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
answer to that question we played a
little<00:01:10.380> bit<00:01:10.649> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.190> we<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.149> nice<00:01:12.300> thing

about turbo cars is you can now you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.790 
about turbo cars is you can now you can
always<00:01:14.340> turn<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> wick<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.800> we

there will always be people who want to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
there will always be people who want to
do<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.860> upgraded<00:01:26.220> powertrain<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
do an upgraded powertrain by a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
do an upgraded powertrain by a
calibration<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.380> maybe<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> bigger<00:01:28.860> turbo<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
calibration or maybe a bigger turbo and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
calibration or maybe a bigger turbo and
and<00:01:29.759> historically<00:01:30.660> Chrysler<00:01:31.110> has<00:01:31.289> always

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and historically Chrysler has always

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.280 
and historically Chrysler has always
been<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.160> supportive<00:01:32.399> of<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.910> with<00:01:33.300> our

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
been very supportive of that with our

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
been very supportive of that with our
one<00:01:34.410> kids<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.980> I<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.970> you're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
one kids so I I think you know you're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.370 
one kids so I I think you know you're
reasonable<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.690> look<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.020> things<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.260> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
reasonable to look for things like that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
reasonable to look for things like that
in<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> future<00:01:37.800> yeah<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.550> brought<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> car

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
in the future yeah you brought out a car

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
in the future yeah you brought out a car
with<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.480> venom<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.290> had<00:01:40.470> 200

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
with the venom right and that had 200

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.430 
with the venom right and that had 200
horsepower<00:01:41.190> so<00:01:41.760> let's<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.570> tear<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.170> front

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
horsepower so let's go to tear the front

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.620 
horsepower so let's go to tear the front
wheels<00:01:43.650> off<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.520> no<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> one

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
wheels off no no you know one of the one

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
wheels off no no you know one of the one
of<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.780> great<00:01:45.960> things<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:46.260> this<00:01:46.530> chassis

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
of the great things about this chassis

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
of the great things about this chassis
is<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.730> a<00:01:47.940> how<00:01:48.060> planet<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> even<00:01:49.050> with<00:01:49.200> 1

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is it's a how planet it is even with 1

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.020 
is it's a how planet it is even with 1
and<00:01:49.620> 1/2<00:01:49.710> degrees<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.130> negative<00:01:50.550> camera<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and 1/2 degrees a negative camera at the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
and 1/2 degrees a negative camera at the
front<00:01:51.240> axle<00:01:51.540> which<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:51.780> pretty<00:01:51.990> aggressive

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
front axle which is pretty aggressive

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.430 
front axle which is pretty aggressive
it's<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.820> equal<00:01:53.970> length<00:01:54.180> half<00:01:54.360> shafts<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it's got equal length half shafts and so

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.590 
it's got equal length half shafts and so
what<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.740> does<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> keeps<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.330> car

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
what that does is it keeps the car

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
what that does is it keeps the car
really<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.530> stable<00:01:58.800> under<00:01:59.130> acceleration<00:01:59.400> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
really very stable under acceleration is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.410 
really very stable under acceleration is
there's<00:02:00.420> no<00:02:00.930> torque<00:02:01.200> steer<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.500> speak<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
there's no torque steer to speak of and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.760 
there's no torque steer to speak of and
and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.720> helps<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> strong

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and it really helps you get a strong

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.590 
and it really helps you get a strong
drive<00:02:05.040> off<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> corner<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.970> remember<00:02:09.300> my

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
drive off the corner you remember my

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.250 
drive off the corner you remember my
friend<00:02:09.750> had<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.400> GL<00:02:11.400> H<00:02:12.030> goes<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.570> hell<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.020> don't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
friend had a GL H goes like hell I don't

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
friend had a GL H goes like hell I don't
feel<00:02:13.410> over<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.740> anyone<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.370> time<00:02:14.550> but

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
feel over that anyone for your time but

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.760 
feel over that anyone for your time but
that<00:02:15.240> car<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.960> time<00:02:16.170> had<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.740> of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
that car you at that time had a lot of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.370 
that car you at that time had a lot of
torque<00:02:17.580> steer<00:02:17.880> yeah<00:02:18.120> step<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> gas<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
torque steer yeah step on the gas and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.780 
torque steer yeah step on the gas and
change<00:02:19.590> lanes<00:02:19.860> yeah<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> only<00:02:20.340> question<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
change lanes yeah the only question is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.400 
change lanes yeah the only question is
which<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.150> are<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.270> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.630> exactly<00:02:22.080> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
which way are you going to go exactly so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.870 
which way are you going to go exactly so
so<00:02:22.620> how<00:02:22.710> much<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> electronics<00:02:23.490> aid<00:02:23.640> in

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
so how much do the electronics aid in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.930 
so how much do the electronics aid in
there<00:02:24.030> today<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.470> guess<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> best<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.760> best

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
there today so I guess the best the best

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
there today so I guess the best the best
metaphor<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.510> talk<00:02:27.690> about<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:29.190> build

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
metaphor to talk about this is to build

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920 
metaphor to talk about this is to build
a<00:02:29.459> strong<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> good<00:02:30.300> house<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
a strong have a good house you have to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.830 
a strong have a good house you have to
build<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> strong<00:02:31.560> foundation<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.390> car

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
build it on a strong foundation so a car

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.040 
build it on a strong foundation so a car
can<00:02:34.020> be<00:02:34.110> great<00:02:34.350> with<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> electronics<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
can be great with the electronics on and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
can be great with the electronics on and
that<00:02:37.050> cars<00:02:37.290> probably<00:02:37.500> great<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
that cars probably great with the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.500 
that cars probably great with the
electronics<00:02:38.580> off

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
electronics off

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.119 
electronics off
a<00:02:39.569> car<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.530> okay<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
a car that's just okay with the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.280 
a car that's just okay with the
electronics<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.819> might<00:02:42.689> be<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> basket<00:02:43.170> case

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
electronics on might be a basket case

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
electronics on might be a basket case
with<00:02:43.530> them<00:02:43.650> off<00:02:43.799> but<00:02:44.040> basically<00:02:44.730> when<00:02:44.939> we<00:02:45.060> set

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
with them off but basically when we set

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.759 
with them off but basically when we set
out<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:45.689> program<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.260> started<00:02:46.319> off

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
out to do this program we started off

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.490 
out to do this program we started off
saying<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.060> raw<00:02:48.269> chassis<00:02:48.900> tuning<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
saying the the raw chassis tuning the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.000 
saying the the raw chassis tuning the
powertrain

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
powertrain

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.619 
powertrain
tuning<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.879> everything's<00:02:51.299> got<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> be

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
tuning you know everything's got to be

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.319 
tuning you know everything's got to be
strong<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.409> then<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.220> superimpose<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.970> top<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
strong and then we superimpose on top of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.089 
strong and then we superimpose on top of
that<00:02:54.450> things<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.079> TTC<00:02:55.409> system<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
that things like the TTC system the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.940 
that things like the TTC system the
torque<00:02:56.310> transfer<00:02:56.519> control<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:58.200> TTC<00:02:58.500> system

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
torque transfer control the TTC system

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.410 
torque transfer control the TTC system
is<00:02:59.069> something<00:02:59.310> actually<00:02:59.459> we've<00:02:59.909> spent<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> lot

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
is something actually we've spent a lot

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
is something actually we've spent a lot
of<00:03:00.450> time<00:03:00.690> tuning<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.110> racetracks<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.769> in<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
of time tuning on racetracks so in a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.059 
of time tuning on racetracks so in a
situation<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:02.940> second<00:03:03.510> gear

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
situation like right now second gear

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.890 
situation like right now second gear
straight<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.700> step<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.269> power<00:03:06.480> and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
straight you step into the power and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.110 
straight you step into the power and
some<00:03:07.500> cars<00:03:07.739> will<00:03:08.129> start<00:03:08.400> some<00:03:08.760> front-wheel

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
some cars will start some front-wheel

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.369 
some cars will start some front-wheel
drive<00:03:09.180> cars<00:03:09.540> they'll<00:03:09.720> start<00:03:09.930> spinning<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
drive cars they'll start spinning that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.110 
drive cars they'll start spinning that
inside<00:03:10.739> from<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> wheel<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.609> don't<00:03:11.760> get<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.909> very

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
inside from a wheel you don't get a very

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.339 
inside from a wheel you don't get a very
good<00:03:12.150> drive<00:03:12.420> off<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.659> corner

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
good drive off the corner

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.960 
good drive off the corner
this<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.859> just<00:03:13.980> applies<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> little<00:03:14.640> bit<00:03:14.879> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
this one just applies a little bit of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.970 
this one just applies a little bit of
brake<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.480> inside<00:03:15.780> front<00:03:16.079> wheel<00:03:16.260> kills

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
brake on that inside front wheel kills

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.160 
brake on that inside front wheel kills
the<00:03:17.159> wheel<00:03:17.310> spin<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:18.150> gets<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.480> reduced

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
the wheel spin and gets you reduced

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
the wheel spin and gets you reduced
understeer<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.889> much<00:03:20.340> better<00:03:20.549> Drive<00:03:20.819> off<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
understeer and much better Drive off the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.839 
understeer and much better Drive off the
corner

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.399 

all<00:03:27.420> right<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:27.659> here's<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> funny<00:03:28.109> thing<00:03:28.170> we

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
all right so here's the funny thing we

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.309 
all right so here's the funny thing we
just<00:03:28.560> did<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.859> 0-60<00:03:29.549> acceleration<00:03:29.760> test<00:03:30.540> with

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
just did a 0-60 acceleration test with

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.899 
just did a 0-60 acceleration test with
this<00:03:31.469> car<00:03:31.769> directly<00:03:32.159> against<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.730> Mini

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
this car directly against the Mini

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.750 
this car directly against the Mini
Cooper<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:35.099> crazy<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.519> they

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
Cooper and it was crazy because they

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.099 
Cooper and it was crazy because they
were<00:03:35.819> 0.1<00:03:36.689> second<00:03:37.049> apart<00:03:37.349> so<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.129> one<00:03:38.249> only

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
were 0.1 second apart so this one only

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.289 
were 0.1 second apart so this one only
7.7<00:03:40.109> in<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> Kenickie<00:03:40.590> million<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:41.099> 7.6<00:03:41.879> and

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
7.7 in the Kenickie million for 7.6 and

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.030 
7.7 in the Kenickie million for 7.6 and
that<00:03:42.780> has<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> lot<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.379> with<00:03:43.439> driver<00:03:43.739> but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
that has a lot to do with driver but

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.069 
that has a lot to do with driver but
were<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.489> benchmarking<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> Mini<00:03:45.719> when<00:03:45.989> you

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
were you benchmarking the Mini when you

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.110 
were you benchmarking the Mini when you
went<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.129> this<00:03:47.370> car<00:03:47.579> over<00:03:47.909> you<00:03:48.090> just

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
went you know for this car over you just

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
Europe where this car started its life

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.170 
Europe where this car started its life
specifically<00:03:53.489> I'm<00:03:53.639> talking<00:03:53.669> about<00:03:53.939> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
specifically I'm talking about the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
Abarth here yep there's just a mess of a

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.750 
Abarth here yep there's just a mess of a
segment<00:03:57.689> hot<00:03:58.019> hatches<00:03:58.260> right<00:03:58.829> it's<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.489> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
segment hot hatches right it's a it's a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.030 
segment hot hatches right it's a it's a
really<00:03:59.939> popular<00:04:00.419> popular<00:04:01.200> segment<00:04:01.859> they're

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
really popular popular segment they're

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.610 
really popular popular segment they're
not<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:02.969> much<00:04:03.030> here<00:04:03.359> right<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.439> Mini

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
not so much here right and in the Mini

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.319 
not so much here right and in the Mini
Cooper<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.219> V<00:04:05.400> segment<00:04:05.849> car<00:04:06.000> right<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.269> a

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
Cooper is a V segment car right it's a

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.970 
Cooper is a V segment car right it's a
larger<00:04:06.689> car<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.709> more<00:04:08.159> expensive<00:04:08.400> car<00:04:08.750> but

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
larger car it's a more expensive car but

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.129 
larger car it's a more expensive car but
certainly<00:04:10.980> certainly<00:04:11.579> we<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:12.150> we<00:04:12.930> like

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
certainly certainly we like to we like

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.509 
certainly certainly we like to we like
to<00:04:13.230> perform<00:04:13.409> well<00:04:13.769> relative<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.400> our

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
to perform well relative to our

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.339 
to perform well relative to our
competition<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.629> think<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.900> car<00:04:16.049> makes<00:04:16.259> a

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
competition and I think the car makes a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.189 
competition and I think the car makes a
very<00:04:16.470> good<00:04:16.590> case<00:04:16.859> for<00:04:17.099> itself<00:04:17.310> it's<00:04:17.789> different

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
very good case for itself it's different

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.719 
very good case for itself it's different
but<00:04:19.199> I<00:04:19.259> think<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.070> think<00:04:20.099> it's<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.430> very

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
but I think it's a I think it's a very

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.550 
but I think it's a I think it's a very
strong<00:04:20.910> competitor

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
strong competitor

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.560 
strong competitor
