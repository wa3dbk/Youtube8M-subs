00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.820
 mixed type the importance we have it 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.490
 given to the two tournaments I follow 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.900
 holding that they do not always play the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.900
 same team because we have to 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.980
 go regulating the charges and because all 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.859
 the players have to go showing 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 earning minutes the team for tomorrow if 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.199
 I was going to go tight 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.199
 gutiÃ©rrez delgado romo bravo 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.510
 clear here goes that fuensalida coria 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.560
 gutiÃ©rrez I living we know all the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.020
 we know that they are parties 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.540
 different specials the classics the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.800
 crowd beyond that lately already 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 we have been playing with the whole town 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.900
 colocolino to camps but it is a is a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.989
 special check for us because we 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.340
 grab in equal measure to be able to 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.309
 play it equal 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.320
 so seven tournaments very well has touched 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.970
 the first dates would be more than 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.379
 worried let's play equal to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.449
 just like we 're going to try to win the 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.710
 first minute party that the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.530
 classics are always made for 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.720
 winning them is a worn but real phrase 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.360
 the classics are very important there 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.670
 special motivations week one 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.159
 is different the player is with a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.990
 tingling with desire to play and these 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.240
 players want a rematch because 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.950
 the last classics went well for us 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 how it did not go well with the Catholic what 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 we were able to reverse and especially with a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.710
 First time I had not been good 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 colo colore we turned in the second 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.230
 time and side of chili with everything 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.540
 means we are going to face 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.160
 the classic giving the best of us 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.560
 I hope we wake up well 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.180
 let's have a good afternoon and we can 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 round up the good work that we are 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 doing and I winning a costume 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.210
 when I say a winning wardrobe it's not 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.730
 only that I refer to the three 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.240
 points when I say winner is confidence 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.180
 is security is that they open up in what 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.460
 prior to being encouraged and at another time 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.730
 I did not see it touches be honest not 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.220
 to demean barnechea but the other 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.860
 day in 15 minutes we had four or five 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.270
 situations after two were not born 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.550
 times did two goals four better 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.150
 we put on inaccurate us 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.320
 we went from the game we ran as we say 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.660
 the Argentine to the fart here is said what 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.770
 we did not run much to the fart, do not say 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 we are more than we had thought 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.870
 then with the uv it is surely another 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.240
 another other topic 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.410
 another party and even more later the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.540
 conversation I've had with some 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.270
 players so in that aspect I think 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.850
 that about mistakes one has to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.520
 learn it seems very good the support that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.930
 they feel encouraging because that 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.260
 means that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.280
 and they still believe that they trust the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.480
 problem when the players no longer 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.730
 trust a coach that's done 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.500
 much more difficult with respect to the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.290
 chili production all of you what 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.359
 they saw that the attitude put the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
 a country's shirt always has to 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.769
 have the attitude of alone the 20 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.389
 chiles minutes since they saw it they could not 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.760
 concretize the situations they did very 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.409
 good match and argentina has that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.269
 argentina today plays very neat and 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.370
 when they catch you a little unsuspecting 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.680
 with two or three balls they have players 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.389
 at a high level that you get hurt 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 I said it in the previous thing that is going to be a 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.780
 return game I think that's how it was 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.910
 and the result I do not know if you can 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.310
 catalog just I always say that the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.640
 options that have to be specified but 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 the chile beyond the rival of the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.610
 importance of the rival as Argentina 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.220
 I think he made a good first half and the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.330
 second time a little the sites no longer 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.330
 they had the same aggressiveness
