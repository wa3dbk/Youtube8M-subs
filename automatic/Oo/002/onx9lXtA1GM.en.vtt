00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
maybe take my watching my ring off and

maybe take my watching my ring off and
what<00:00:03.990> are<00:00:04.049> we<00:00:04.110> doing<00:00:04.350> sometimes<00:00:05.250> people<00:00:05.549> like

what are we doing sometimes people like
to<00:00:05.700> do<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> experiments<00:00:06.540> at<00:00:06.600> home<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.960> so

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
to do the experiments at home and so

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.600 
to do the experiments at home and so
this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.379> kind<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> classic<00:00:08.099> using

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
this is kind of a classic using

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.459 
this is kind of a classic using
cornstarch<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.300> water<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.349> do

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
cornstarch and water and so what you do

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
cornstarch and water and so what you do
is<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.710> take<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.889> box<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.250> cornstarch<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:12.240> port

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
is you take a box of cornstarch you port

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.789 
is you take a box of cornstarch you port
into<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.750> bowl<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.349> add<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.530> water

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
into a bowl and then you add some water

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.230 
into a bowl and then you add some water
until<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.340> get<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.639> kind<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> soupy

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
until you get this kind of soupy

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
until you get this kind of soupy
consistency<00:00:15.560> and<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.220> feel<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.609> go

gonna hand you this ball buddy so hold
out<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:39.840> hand<00:00:40.110> radio<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.790> energy<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:42.000> turned

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
out your hand radio and energy up turned

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
out your hand radio and energy up turned
into<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> liquid<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> exact<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
into a liquid that exact this is the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
into a liquid that exact this is the
weirdest<00:00:45.770> consistency<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:46.980> punch<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
weirdest consistency you can punch it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
weirdest consistency you can punch it
and<00:00:47.820> once<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> punch<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.590> traps

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and once you punch it it actually traps

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.860 
and once you punch it it actually traps
water<00:00:50.190> between<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.789> molecules<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> starch<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
water between the molecules of starch in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
water between the molecules of starch in
the<00:00:52.140> cornstarch<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.800> turns<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> solid

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the cornstarch and it turns into a solid

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
the cornstarch and it turns into a solid
so<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.000> watch<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> moment<00:00:55.649> there

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so here watch this see that moment there

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.139 
so here watch this see that moment there
isn't<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.520> starch<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:58.410> wonder<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.820> could

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
isn't a starch I wonder what this could

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.380 
isn't a starch I wonder what this could
be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.070 
be
all<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.910> don't<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.049> just

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
all right I don't know but I'm just

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.780 
all right I don't know but I'm just
sitting<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.680> thinking<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.489> mind

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sitting here thinking would you mind

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
sitting here thinking would you mind
removing<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:07.100> nice<00:01:08.100> sorry<00:01:09.320> seven<00:01:10.320> feet<00:01:10.680> long

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
removing that nice sorry seven feet long

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
removing that nice sorry seven feet long
3<00:01:11.340> feet<00:01:11.670> wide<00:01:11.939> about<00:01:12.270> 2<00:01:12.659> feet<00:01:12.840> deep<00:01:12.900> there's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
3 feet wide about 2 feet deep there's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.600 
3 feet wide about 2 feet deep there's
2,500<00:01:14.220> pounds<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.270> cornstarch<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.610> isn't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
2,500 pounds of cornstarch in here isn't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.740 
2,500 pounds of cornstarch in here isn't
that<00:01:17.700> amazing

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that amazing

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
that amazing
look<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.390> watch<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> can

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
look at that so now watch this you can

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.920 
look at that so now watch this you can
just<00:01:22.290> punch<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> becomes<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.240> solid<00:01:24.570> at

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just punch it and it becomes a solid at

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.580 
just punch it and it becomes a solid at
that<00:01:25.110> split<00:01:25.470> second

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
that split second

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.710 
that split second
so<00:01:28.340> when<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.610> put<00:01:28.850> pressure<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.479> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
so when you put pressure on it it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.090 
so when you put pressure on it it
doesn't<00:01:29.930> behave<00:01:30.290> like<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:30.799> here's<00:01:30.979> what

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
doesn't behave like that so here's what

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.260 
doesn't behave like that so here's what
I<00:01:31.159> was<00:01:31.280> thinking<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.610> know<00:01:31.670> you'd<00:01:31.909> like<00:01:32.030> game

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
shows so here's my new game show if you

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.810 
shows so here's my new game show if you
could<00:01:35.180> go<00:01:35.299> from<00:01:35.630> here<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.829> here<00:01:36.860> walking

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
could go from here to here walking

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.990 
could go from here to here walking
across<00:01:38.060> without<00:01:38.600> sinking<00:01:39.110> die<00:01:40.100> alright<00:01:41.090> so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
across without sinking die alright so
