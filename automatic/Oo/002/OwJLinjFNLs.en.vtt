this<00:02:14.090> Pro<00:02:14.390> Tour<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:15.560> he<00:02:15.740> lost<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.340> matter

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
this Pro Tour I think he lost a matter

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.100 
this Pro Tour I think he lost a matter
in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> first<00:02:17.030> draft<00:02:17.270> he<00:02:17.450> played<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.020> he

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
in the first draft he played and then he

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.440 
in the first draft he played and then he
just<00:02:18.320> continued<00:02:18.770> winning<00:02:18.980> up<00:02:19.640> all<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.180> way<00:02:20.270> up

just continued winning up all the way up

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.600 
just continued winning up all the way up
to<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.660> end<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:23.180> shows<00:02:23.710> well<00:02:24.710> this

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
to the end and that just shows well this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.220 
to the end and that just shows well this

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.500 
and colorful that's I think at the at
the<00:02:44.210> time<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.960> was<00:02:44.990> two<00:02:45.320> Hall<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.530> Famers<00:02:45.860> and

it is just a crazy crazy line up with

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.490 
it is just a crazy crazy line up with
with<00:02:51.620> John<00:02:51.950> Finkel<00:02:52.490> arguably<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:54.290> best

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
with John Finkel arguably the best

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.190 
with John Finkel arguably the best
player<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.040> ever<00:02:55.190> play<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.610> game<00:02:55.640> taking<00:02:56.510> this

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
check out the coverage I think this was

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.180 
check out the coverage I think this was
one<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.240> most<00:03:02.360> amazing<00:03:02.950> approach<00:03:03.950> horse

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
one of the most amazing approach horse

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.020 
one of the most amazing approach horse
in<00:03:04.460> in<00:03:05.150> recent<00:03:05.660> history<00:03:06.010> from<00:03:07.010> at<00:03:07.700> least<00:03:07.940> from

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
next week's are definitely going to be

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.510 
next week's are definitely going to be
journey<00:03:44.180> into<00:03:44.360> nicks<00:03:44.690> all<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.650> time<00:03:45.920> joining

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
journey into nicks all the time joining

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.920 
journey into nicks all the time joining
to<00:03:46.640> nicks<00:03:46.850> born<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.300> gods<00:03:47.330> they're<00:03:47.780> worse

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
to nicks born of the gods they're worse

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.810 
to nicks born of the gods they're worse
drafts<00:03:48.430> there<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.640> no<00:03:50.410> common<00:03:51.410> bestow<00:03:52.010> cycle

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
drafts there is no common bestow cycle

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.060 
drafts there is no common bestow cycle
this<00:03:52.970> time<00:03:53.300> around<00:03:53.450> there's<00:03:53.900> less<00:03:54.140> ordeals<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
this time around there's less ordeals I

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.770 
this time around there's less ordeals I
think<00:03:55.370> there<00:03:55.520> is<00:03:55.550> less<00:03:55.820> power<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.510> toughness

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
think there is less power and toughness

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.830 
think there is less power and toughness
boosting<00:03:57.410> auras<00:03:57.770> overall<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.850> there's

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
boosting auras overall so there's

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.130 
boosting auras overall so there's
basically<00:04:00.380> two<00:04:00.709> things<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.400> could<00:04:01.550> happen

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
basically two things that could happen

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.840 
basically two things that could happen
the<00:04:03.140> first<00:04:03.410> thing<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.370> format

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
the first thing is that the format

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.510 
the first thing is that the format
normalizes<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> bit<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.709> second<00:04:07.040> thing<00:04:07.100> is

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
normalizes a bit and the second thing is

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.590 
normalizes a bit and the second thing is
that<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:09.080> good<00:04:09.500> cards<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.640> good<00:04:11.180> bestow

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
that the good cards of the good bestow

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.330 
that the good cards of the good bestow
cards<00:04:12.020> are<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.320> good<00:04:12.470> ordeals<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.040> all<00:04:13.190> these

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
cards are the good ordeals and all these

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.490 
cards are the good ordeals and all these
kind<00:04:13.610> of<00:04:13.640> things<00:04:13.760> get<00:04:14.510> even<00:04:14.720> more<00:04:14.989> important

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
kind of things get even more important

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.830 
kind of things get even more important
so<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.709> gets<00:04:15.860> maybe<00:04:16.370> even<00:04:16.580> more<00:04:16.790> extreme<00:04:17.180> with

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
so it gets maybe even more extreme with

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.590 
so it gets maybe even more extreme with
that<00:04:18.080> change<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:19.120> some<00:04:20.120> things<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.390> want<00:04:20.540> to

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
that change and some things I want to

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.140 
that change and some things I want to
talk<00:04:20.840> about<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:21.440> once<00:04:21.979> again<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.580> problem<00:04:23.090> of

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
talk about is once again the problem of

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730 
talk about is once again the problem of
choosing<00:04:23.570> your<00:04:23.660> colors<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.260> positioning

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
choosing your colors and positioning

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.480 
choosing your colors and positioning
yourself<00:04:24.830> at<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.280> table<00:04:25.669> there's

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
yourself at the table there's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.089 
yourself at the table there's
again<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.940> cycle<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.479> gold<00:04:27.750> card<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.440> keeps

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
again a cycle of gold card so that keeps

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.270 
again a cycle of gold card so that keeps
interesting<00:04:29.789> during<00:04:30.599> drafting<00:04:31.139> then<00:04:32.009> there

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
interesting during drafting then there

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
interesting during drafting then there
is<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:33.449> whole<00:04:34.009> heroic<00:04:35.009> or<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.610> hero<00:04:35.970> theme

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
is the whole heroic or the hero theme

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.210 
is the whole heroic or the hero theme
where<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.319> heroes<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.860> get<00:04:38.039> one

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
where you have the heroes that get one

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.800 
where you have the heroes that get one
counter<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.729> have<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:38.940> heroes<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.449> get<00:04:39.630> two

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
counter you have the heroes that get two

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.050 
counter you have the heroes that get two
counters<00:04:40.259> even<00:04:40.979> some<00:04:41.190> heroes<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.669> get<00:04:41.819> three

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
counters even some heroes that get three

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.290 
counters even some heroes that get three
counters<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.690> I'm<00:04:43.199> not<00:04:44.009> convinced<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.849> just

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
counters and I'm not convinced that just

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.930 
counters and I'm not convinced that just
slamming<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.680> ones<00:04:46.919> that<00:04:47.190> get<00:04:47.310> one<00:04:47.520> counter

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
slamming the ones that get one counter

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.330 
slamming the ones that get one counter
is<00:04:48.120> still<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.900> correct<00:04:49.199> line<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.560> play<00:04:49.770> rings

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
is still the correct line of play rings

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.430 
is still the correct line of play rings
in<00:04:50.490> writer<00:04:50.699> remains<00:04:51.120> really<00:04:51.690> really<00:04:51.900> good<00:04:52.110> but

how good are these one ones that get a

how good are these one ones that get a
single<00:04:55.020> counter<00:04:55.530> how<00:04:55.710> good<00:04:55.919> are<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:57.090> 0

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
single counter how good are the is the 0

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.360 
single counter how good are the is the 0
for<00:04:57.599> that<00:04:57.810> gets<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.080> single<00:04:58.259> counter<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:58.860> we'll

the new format and that's what I'm going
to<00:05:08.580> be<00:05:08.639> tackling<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:09.599> if<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.319> have<00:05:10.590> any<00:05:10.979> kind

to be tackling so if you have any kind
of<00:05:12.380> great<00:05:13.380> experience<00:05:14.130> versus<00:05:14.789> with<00:05:15.180> cards

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
of great experience versus with cards

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.710 
of great experience versus with cards
that<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.919> didn't<00:05:17.280> think<00:05:17.430> would<00:05:17.550> be<00:05:17.759> good<00:05:17.789> that

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
that you didn't think would be good that

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.960 
that you didn't think would be good that
that's<00:05:19.169> definitely<00:05:19.710> something<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.370> can

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
that's definitely something that can

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.600 
that's definitely something that can
help<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.419> maybe<00:05:22.110> get<00:05:22.349> an<00:05:22.470> edge<00:05:22.770> early<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.310> in

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
help you maybe get an edge early on in

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.480 
help you maybe get an edge early on in
the<00:05:23.789> in<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.330> limited<00:05:24.840> queues<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:25.490> otherwise

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
the in the limited queues and otherwise

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.580 
the in the limited queues and otherwise
yeah<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.389> format<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:27.960> going<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.289> be<00:05:28.380> relevant

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
yeah this format is going to be relevant

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.770 
yeah this format is going to be relevant
as<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.099> sealed<00:05:29.550> deck<00:05:29.729> format<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.419> draft

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
as a sealed deck format as a draft

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.540 
as a sealed deck format as a draft
format<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.409> then<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:33.349> think<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.919> at<00:05:35.190> least<00:05:35.400> in

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
format and then I think the at least in

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.089 
format and then I think the at least in
Europe<00:05:35.849> there's<00:05:36.090> Grand<00:05:36.419> Prix<00:05:36.680> Warsaw<00:05:37.680> coming

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
Europe there's Grand Prix Warsaw coming

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.700 
Europe there's Grand Prix Warsaw coming
up<00:05:38.280> which<00:05:38.969> will<00:05:39.240> highlight<00:05:39.870> this<00:05:40.139> basically

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
up which will highlight this basically

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.580 
up which will highlight this basically
as<00:05:40.889> a<00:05:40.919> limited<00:05:41.400> pre-release<00:05:41.909> GP<00:05:42.479> and<00:05:42.719> then<00:05:43.320> I'm

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
as a limited pre-release GP and then I'm

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.100 
as a limited pre-release GP and then I'm
sure<00:05:43.889> there's<00:05:44.130> other<00:05:44.310> GPS<00:05:44.849> as<00:05:45.000> well<00:05:45.210> featuring

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
sure there's other GPS as well featuring

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.709
