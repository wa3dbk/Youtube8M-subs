00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 to go to splash on the border 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 you have to get to brandenburg 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.910
 a small safari about Mecklenburg 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 make villages 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 hobby researchers discover there 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.760
 then also quite exotic one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.810
 elephant yard and not just the ponies 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 pigs go this little ranch 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.340
 which is not that small it has in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.590
 You can tell immediately how did this come from 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 Dice heap after place 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.210
 originally he comes from the circus then 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.230
 no circus of that time 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 Engaged mainly in northern Europe 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 we had five elephants and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.489
 had a winter quarters nearby 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 from Hannover and that would always be 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 smaller and too small because the elephants 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.969
 got bigger then we have what 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.440
 wanted then stayed here one 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.780
 because it was the most beautiful here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.410
 large meadow beautiful barn has everything 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 fit 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.379
 from a winter home for circus animals 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 became a year-round crowd puller 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.590
 The visitors then wanted to make family copies 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.479
 also offer something 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.659
 for example, this idea was born 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.820
 the sea lion shoes jeans krejci 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.799
 the two are half brothers and ask 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.460
 with their tricks just everything in the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.920
 shadow 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.869
 jennifer krÃ¶plin and her brother have 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.539
 taught the two a lot 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.929
 their learning ability seems limitless as 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.200
 long only about the reward piece 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:35.469

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.880
 skits hands the fish to the girl 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.729

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.390
 yes do not meet yourself at all 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.959
