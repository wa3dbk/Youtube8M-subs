00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi all nice that you watch 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.330
 paragraph 1 today I'm going to show you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.670
 how to put in pens with your horse 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.540
 you want to know where they are to stay 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.309
 Then be sure to watch as you race 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 and then it applies that you are from April to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 October and outside often 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 that's on grass because you don't get that out 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 with card i show you how to be a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 real football shoes can give we go 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 the pins turn in with our horse and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 that helps against slipping and then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 do you have girls with screw holes for 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.109
 and I'll show you how 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 looks like 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.460
 come makes you should it looks like this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.379
 out of this is just the horseshoe 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 and here are two holes in it and here 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 we will soon be screwing in those pens from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 my tools that I need on markers 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.579
 to turn in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 these two things i need to get into 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.730
 and then the wooden bones 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 to make 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 these are the marker the same are just 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 a kind of screws 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 This is the finest in the largest 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 crooks from scratching and now I go 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.650
 just the free cleaning and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.240
 I do this with this one has the tip 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.990
 and a brush and with this talc 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 piercing scarves with that point 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.390
 those free so make all dirt 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.590
 I often come back and sand 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.240
 sometimes stones was when they were really whole 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 good cleaning because you get everything 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 that marker and once 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 is my fellow cleaning and then here 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 running is really a must with school 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.610
 don't let it go too far by turning it on 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.610
 namely lifting with iron 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.869
 now i'm going with the brush the last one 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.869
 remove leftovers 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.009
 do not need to be completely clean and then 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.459
 It is now time to insert those pens 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.649
 grab 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.119
 I'm just going to show that for it now 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.310
 but you can do that normally 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.959
 speaking, do it if you really 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 remove the competition and term from the trailer 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.560
 is with a soft bottom 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.060
 if you do that in advance then you can 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 you get holes in the bottom of you 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.569
 trailer and it's not so good for 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.829
 each of your horse because out by one 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.829
 very strange pressure 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.160
 little pipi is ready I do that too 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.440
 the other feet and then we can ourselves 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.480
 drive a letter if you go pens 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.430
 can buy just the tack store 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.860
 You always get a few extras with it 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 so in case you lose one she 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.340
 can also give you information about 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.160
 different forms and different 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.600
 types and you can also buy your tools there 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.820
 now you know how you can do your horse 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.710
 fitted with real football shoes and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.540
 it protects against slipping 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.820
