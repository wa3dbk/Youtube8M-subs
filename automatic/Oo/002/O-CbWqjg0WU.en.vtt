00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.250
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.320
 Here I bring you chapter number 19 of 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.110
 your pixelar and this time we are with sing 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.000
 the short and it really brings us pixelar 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.470
 very well finished with pretty details 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.810
 impressive even shadows 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.130
 amazing, there are some that have 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.080
 called a lot of attention but good 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.910
 let's go commenting the first of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.589
 everyone has homer here in that homero 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.359
 position that starts to fall the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.609
 turkey whenever you start thinking about 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.829
 food or in those paranoias that come in 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.300
 to homer the truth is that it is very very 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.739
 well I liked it a lot especially the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.430
 construction that is quite striking 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.600
 with blocks of gold metal blocks and the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.300
 mouth area is with blocks 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.859
 illuminated is very very well and good for 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.430
 here we see everyone riding in a 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.710
 stroller and this great companion of mario 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.899
 in the kart martius you practically get 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.910
 just like in the videogame he has 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.550
 remembered a lot those mario careers 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 kart that were multiplayer with with a 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.539
 little cousin that I have and the truth is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.850
 that I like a lot because that game is 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.370
 a little bit so competitive from strollers and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.260
 I find that quite entertaining the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.810
 pixelar is very good because it has 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.960
 shadows and it's great and good we're going to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.450
 keep watching here has a songo'o 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.790
 releasing a vital wave do not get confused 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.460
 it may look vegetated by that suit 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.560
 blue that has and is so characteristic 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 of vegeta but it is not someone and it has 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.550
 very much liked the hair detail 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 which is the most complicated area of this 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 pixelar and it really has been very 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.630
 well the area of ​​the hair as you see and it is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.340
 really hard to leave with that great 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 detail and that you also see the hair 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 I just liked it a lot 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 of the hair so good let's continue here 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 we have the protagonist of metal slug 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.280
 that game and there is also arcade to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 xbox but I played it more on machines 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.120
 recreational before in the bars 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.070
 if you remember always the way there was a 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.990
 Lots of weapons I liked a lot has 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.320
 made shadows on this floor too 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.690
 a final detail very very good and good 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.370
 As you can see, it's great, someone also 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.800
 The whole thing has caught my attention 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.710
 here 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.380
 we also have a charm under also 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.600
 it's pretty good although we already saw it in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 some chapter if I remember correctly and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.470
 good we have to nu that I do not know how it 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 pronounces exactly because it's your 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.160
 English name and is one of the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.760
 protagonists of the sonic saga the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.350
 Actually , I quite like and is 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.820
 really good although we do not have much 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.010
 space like to see it a little away 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.210
 because we are here between houses but 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.860
 Well the truth is that it is very good 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.070
 is very well reminds me also to the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.410
 sonic games pretty and good I hope 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.290
 that you like here too 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.060
 we see one of the most impressive is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.690
 naruto 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.660
 as if he were taking the power out of him 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.000
 this nine-tailed fox incredible this 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.430
 pixelar would say it's my favorite this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 chapter in that position you can even see 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.350
 as part of the fox tails 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.680
 although they are not nine but it is one but 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.990
 he sees very well how that wave surrounds him 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.660
 red that is like the inner strength of the 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.360
 incredible nine-tailed lining is 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.370
 pixelar is the best one of the best 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.350
 I've never seen a lot 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.380
 how it has been and the idea itself 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.270
 because the naruto series the drought makes 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.520
 enough time and the truth is that it has 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.380
 remembered very much to see the series and the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.660
 nine-tailed fox mostly for 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.910
 that red profile that looks amazing if 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.560
 You see, well, what else do we have here? 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.880
 a mega man zero that we already saw it too 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.670
 in other chapters it is also quite 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.770
 achieved is fine with those parts 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.440
 yellows that are like the back 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.570
 that made as fire there is great 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.540
 and well there we have one of those flowers 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.550
 typical and that are so easy to make and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.410
 they look so good to me I like them very much 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.230
 how is this pixelar and I think one 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.060
 of the easiest landmarks 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 and you are starting with pixelar os 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.069
 I would recommend doing one of that style of 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.930
 that flower is very well animates quite 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.030
 your map and it's very very easy very 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.330
 easy to look we also have the pixel 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 of the floating block that never fails 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.950
 it seems that people already do it and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.760
 all haha so good what else we have 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.350
 around here we have an imperial gentleman 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.470
 a little person from the imperial forces 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.630
 of starwars very good this soldier is 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.120
 very well let's see it in more detail 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.440
 from a little further because this is 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.210
 angle is a bit bad to see it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.340
 really so it comes a bit to me 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.120
 there so you can see it a little better 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.100
 because it really is well done 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.199
 it has a pretty big head and the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.030
 very small body but it does like a 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.370
 effect like this comic style and remains 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.560
 really funny I liked it 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.970
 a lot also and as you see the issue of 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.790
 shadows is also quite accomplished in 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.430
 this pixelar and good to emphasize those that I 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.280
 I mean, I wanted to emphasize what has 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.250
 very much liked the naruto invoking the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.290
 nine-tailed fox so I'm going to 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.000
 try to catch some take a little 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.949
 better a slightly better angle that looks 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.370
 full because I liked it 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:09.789
 very much this pixelar and good is that 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.530
 look at the profile that it does or is that is 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.139
 it's great I'll see if I see it a little 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.180
 better because this pixel so it has 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.039
 called a lot of attention in addition to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.840
 Naruto who had not seen any yet and 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.270
 It surprises me a lot because in the car 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.430
 I think it's quite famous and good as 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.400
 you see the profile of the fox of 9 things is 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.350
 super accomplished has effects with some 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.169
 blocks that are slightly lighter if 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.699
 you have fixed and it is very good 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.380
 truth is that from here I do not get better 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.120
 angle that we had before like this 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.580
 I'm going to get another one from here 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.440
 and as I tell you, the profile has 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.420
 blocks a little lighter than 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.700
 they give it a touch so good 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.680
 I simply hope that this chapter will 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.010
 I liked it I wanted to thank 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.700
 sinde short for showing me pixelar 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.380
 very interesting I liked it very much 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.540
 I hope that you too have 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.490
