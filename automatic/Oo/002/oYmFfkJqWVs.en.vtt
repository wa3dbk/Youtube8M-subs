00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.200
 cell chemical composition you already know 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.179
 that all living organisms are similar in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 structure 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.410
 they consist of cells but it turns out 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 their chemical composition of cells of all 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.210
 living organisms consist of one and those 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.060
 same elements 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.179
 this is carbon oxygen nitrogen 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 hydrogen j sulfur and many others 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.960
 most of the elements are in the cage 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.579
 in the form of chemical compounds 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.670
 distinguish inorganic and organic 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 substances 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.539

 teeth contain 10 percent water a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.439
 bones up to 20 percent 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 the role of water in the cell is great above all 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.360
 it determines the physical properties 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 cells and and volume resilience 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.670
 numerous chemical reactions 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.530
 pass in the aquatic environment as water 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 good solvent 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 yes and water itself is involved in many 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 chemical reactions water helps 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.000
 removal from the body of unnecessary and harmful 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.270
 substances 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.700
 resulting from the exchange 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.500

 hemoglobin composition 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.470
 kelp sea â€‹â€‹kale is rich in iodine 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.850
 it is necessary for thyroid work 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.180

 fats carbohydrates nucleic acid proteins 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 this is the main substance of the cell they 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 involved in the formation of the nucleus of the cytoplasm 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.140
 cells and and organoids 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.510

 muscle not exercised without 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.190
 contractile proteins 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.020
 proteins are involved in protecting the body from 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.600
 of infections 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.200
 blood coagulation is important in 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.560
 in the body 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.280
 play and carbohydrates are well known 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.200
 all glucose sucrose beet sugar 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.000
 which we eat every day 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.480
 fiber starch main function 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.660
 carbohydrate energy living organisms 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.900
 can store carbohydrates in the form of starch 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.000
 in plants and glycogen in animals and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.100
 mushroom 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.989
 carbohydrates perform protective and support 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.120
 functions 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.180
 Fiber is part of all shells 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.959
 plant cells 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.980
 chitin form the outer skeleton of insects 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.640
 crustacean fat and perform in the body 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.630
 a number of functions for example serve as a spare 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.880
 energy source and perform the reference 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.280
 function being part of cellular and 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.440
 nuclear membranes of some animals fat 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.019
 and accumulates in large quantities and 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.190
 serve as a heat insulator that is 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.560
 protects the body from heat loss 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:13.570
 for example whales fat thickness 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.269
 reaches one meter of great importance 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.239
 have fats and as an internal reserve for 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.110
 extracting water from processes 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.150
 flowing cells from 1 kilogram of fat 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.539
 slightly more than one kilogram is formed 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.490
 water is very important for animals 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.830
 hibernating groundhog gophers 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.879
 bears thanks to their hypodermic 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.939
 fat reserve 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:43.719
 they may not drink at this time until two 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:46.930
 months camels during the transitions 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:48.210
 desert without drinking to two 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.729
 weeks 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.400
 the body needs the water they extract 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 from their humps of fat 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.879
 nucleic acids 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.289
 responsible for storage and transfer 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.909
 hereditary traits 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.919
 from parents to offspring and so the most 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.719
 common elements alive 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:16.090
 organisms 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:19.229
 oxygen carbon nitrogen hydrogen chemical 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.879
 the composition of all living organisms converge 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.060
 the composition of living organisms included 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:28.289
 organic matter proteins fats 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.370
 carbohydrates are nucleic acids and 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.240
