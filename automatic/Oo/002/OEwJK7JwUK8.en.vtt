00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 very discreet and calm i am mad 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 energy of this person is given unless 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.980
 eyes 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 many call him Russian legends 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.740
 rock though such wording 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.599
 try to avoid i specifically studied 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.990
 such a question to know as a concept 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.310
 origins of legends and myths 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:28.189
 here and came to the conclusion that I would not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 wanted to fit under any of these 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.390
 articles because I still have legends 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.210
 it's too early in general a myth is such a thing 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 you know this is a little distorted story 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.930
 so as not to distort your story much 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 time Vyacheslav boots did not give 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 interview in communication with journalists he 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 just did not see the point because the whole 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.710
 information to the musician and creativity 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 Jupiter is on the official website of the group 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 undertook such an experiment know two 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:07.070
 years the rack refused any 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.520
 interview only interview and gave 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.729

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:23.060

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.600
 such know abstract 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.439
 These people turned out to be from Vyatka and we 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.990
 as a result, came a bribe and stop 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.990
 its general they will not define the walls 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.799

 Tchaikovsky's spiritual music but 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.830

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.840
 really specialist you without any 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.860
 slyness this is the music that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.860
 starts with a battle 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.140
 you corrected 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.330
 this star has no producer 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.120
 Jupiter publisher moves on its 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.340
 orbit we have no time frame 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.800
 well, just when the material is ready 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.440
 then we recorded it as it is now 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.740
 four years of my cooking he matured 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.490
 it quickly became clear how he would be 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:03.150
 look we cooked it we did 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.590
 demonstration record in petersburg 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.730
 it is necessary to fly here after 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.920
 come back and quietly go to Norway 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.650
 on the fjords was there write down like this house

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.769
 creative bootus is not 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.019
 quantity and quality 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.359
 so that the songs catch not only my hearing 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.670
 Mind as its time did the movie 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.860
 by the way their compositions on the concert of the group 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.340
 always sound vaper feat great 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.360
 respect the cinema group music 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.820
 I really love these songs and I think that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.820
 this is one language 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.020
 full samples of such know 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:47.770
 unburdened 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:53.460
 which is helpful at all times listen 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:58.060
 because basically there what noticed 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.849
 in songs loved by the whole people about 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.689
 things basic but since the group 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.400
 Jupiter 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:09.520
 organized by two people me and george 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.180
 casparyan who is naturally known in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.509
 more like the guitarist of the movie group 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.509
 for this reason , the more we of course 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.110
 perform these songs we have mastered quite 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.360
 large repertoire from the movie group and 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.409
 be sure to perform at least an encore 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.409
 at least one song 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.270
 but
