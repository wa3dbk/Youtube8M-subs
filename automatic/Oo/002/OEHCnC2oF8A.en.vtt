bunch of arm linux guys it'd be good if
a<00:03:13.900> bunch<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.260> them<00:03:14.440> had<00:03:14.860> armlet<00:03:15.459> that's<00:03:15.640> right

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
a bunch of them had armlet that's right

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.240 
a bunch of them had armlet that's right
for<00:03:16.030> their<00:03:16.180> work<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.629> mean<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:17.950> our

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
for their work I mean this is our

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.280

absolutely<00:03:18.910> our<00:03:19.000> target<00:03:19.299> audience<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.780> suspect

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
absolutely our target audience I suspect

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.680 
absolutely our target audience I suspect
if<00:03:20.440> we<00:03:20.620> were<00:03:20.799> able<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.190> turn<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:21.910> laptop

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
if we were able to turn up with a laptop

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.430 
if we were able to turn up with a laptop
and<00:03:22.810> say<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.140> who<00:03:23.290> wants<00:03:23.440> one<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.900> yeah<00:03:25.900> so

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and say right who wants one I yeah so

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.979 
and say right who wants one I yeah so
the<00:03:26.799> choice<00:03:27.640> would<00:03:27.970> be<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.209> major<00:03:28.360> issue<00:03:28.660> I

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the choice would be the major issue I

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.289 
the choice would be the major issue I
think<00:03:29.410> it'd<00:03:29.829> be<00:03:29.860> can<00:03:30.819> we<00:03:30.909> deliver<00:03:31.090> the

it's<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:50.109> there<00:03:50.379> that<00:03:50.560> interested<00:03:51.190> how<00:03:51.459> much

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
it's it there that interested how much

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.970 
it's it there that interested how much
money<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.959> have<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.200> DVD<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> thing<00:03:53.829> we

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
money you have the DVD of the thing we

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.339 
money you have the DVD of the thing we
don't<00:03:54.129> know<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.849> so<00:03:55.390> what's<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.200> background

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
don't know but so what's your background

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.699 
don't know but so what's your background
I<00:03:56.739> saw<00:03:57.129> on<00:03:57.250> my<00:03:57.310> heart<00:03:57.489> well<00:03:57.640> engineer<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:59.049> yeah

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
I saw on my heart well engineer so yeah

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.020 
I saw on my heart well engineer so yeah
guess<00:04:00.099> I'm<00:04:00.220> gonna<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.609> person<00:04:00.790> putting

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
guess I'm gonna be the person putting

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.720 
guess I'm gonna be the person putting
the<00:04:01.180> PCBs<00:04:01.660> together<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:02.200> UK<00:04:02.650> all<00:04:03.340> basically

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
the PCBs together in UK all basically

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.599 
the PCBs together in UK all basically
okay<00:04:04.000> yes<00:04:04.209> everybody's<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:04.930> Cambridge<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
okay yes everybody's in Cambridge in and

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.979 
okay yes everybody's in Cambridge in and
around<00:04:06.819> cave<00:04:07.120> which<00:04:07.329> at<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.540> moment<00:04:07.569> all

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
around cave which at the moment all

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.789 
around cave which at the moment all
those<00:04:08.169> yeah<00:04:08.889> we<00:04:09.790> announced<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.359> as<00:04:10.810> dead

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
those yeah we announced this as dead

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.039 
those yeah we announced this as dead
calm<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:13.299> Portland<00:04:14.069> last<00:04:15.069> year<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.840> we're

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
calm in Portland last year so we're

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.099 
calm in Portland last year so we're
having<00:04:17.320> offers<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:17.769> support<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.459> help

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
having offers of support and help

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.240 
having offers of support and help
realistically<00:04:20.109> until<00:04:20.410> we've<00:04:20.560> got<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.769> working

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
realistically until we've got a working

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.520 
realistically until we've got a working
prototype<00:04:21.910> board<00:04:22.450> until<00:04:22.810> we've<00:04:22.960> actually<00:04:23.110> got

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
prototype board until we've actually got

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.490 
prototype board until we've actually got
a<00:04:23.800> final<00:04:24.789> agreement<00:04:24.970> with<00:04:25.389> one<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.320> chip

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
a final agreement with one of the chip

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.260 
a final agreement with one of the chip
lenders<00:04:26.830> we're<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.669> going<00:04:27.849> to<00:04:27.910> go<00:04:28.030> anywhere

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
lenders we're not going to go anywhere

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.659 
lenders we're not going to go anywhere
as<00:04:28.900> soon<00:04:29.200> as<00:04:29.260> we've<00:04:29.440> got<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.860> then<00:04:30.130> yes<00:04:30.370> we

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
as soon as we've got that then yes we

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.930 
as soon as we've got that then yes we
can<00:04:30.820> stop<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.330> PCB<00:04:31.750> together<00:04:32.940> we're

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
can stop the to the PCB together we're

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.629 
can stop the to the PCB together we're
going<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.150> have<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.450> implement<00:04:35.400> bits<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.580> are

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
going to have to implement bits that are

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.730 
going to have to implement bits that are
not<00:04:36.970> here<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:37.870> sort<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.169> chips<00:04:38.380> were<00:04:38.500> looking

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
not here but sort of chips were looking

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.909 
not here but sort of chips were looking
at<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.360> service<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.530> they<00:04:41.560> don't

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
at I just like the service so they don't

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.920 
at I just like the service so they don't
have<00:04:42.160> USB<00:04:42.550> they<00:04:42.940> don't<00:04:43.150> have<00:04:43.360> video<00:04:43.570> they

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
have USB they don't have video they

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.600 
have USB they don't have video they
don't<00:04:44.139> they<00:04:44.860> don't<00:04:44.889> have<00:04:45.250> all<00:04:45.280> these<00:04:45.550> great

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
don't they don't have all these great

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.740 
don't they don't have all these great
things<00:04:45.910> that's<00:04:46.389> your<00:04:47.289> laptop<00:04:48.360> chips<00:04:49.360> at<00:04:49.539> will

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
things that's your laptop chips at will

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.430 
things that's your laptop chips at will
have<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.860> we're<00:04:51.070> just<00:04:51.099> going<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.460> attempt<00:04:51.940> to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
have so we're just going to attempt to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.010 
have so we're just going to attempt to
be<00:04:53.440> implement<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:53.950> probably<00:04:54.700> over<00:04:55.120> PCI

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
be implement that probably over PCI

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.589 
be implement that probably over PCI
Express<00:04:56.639> which<00:04:57.639> they<00:04:57.820> will<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:58.449> we'll

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
Express which they will have so we'll

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.379 
Express which they will have so we'll
have<00:04:58.690> two<00:04:58.840> outer<00:04:59.050> yo<00:04:59.770> USB<00:05:00.280> ecosystem<00:05:01.090> there's

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
have two outer yo USB ecosystem there's

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.180 
have two outer yo USB ecosystem there's
a<00:05:01.510> good<00:05:01.630> chance<00:05:01.900> i<00:05:02.229> would<00:05:02.289> expect<00:05:02.620> this<00:05:02.889> year

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
a good chance i would expect this year

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.820 
a good chance i would expect this year
for<00:05:03.520> some<00:05:03.820> very<00:05:04.419> powerful<00:05:04.630> arm<00:05:05.139> processors<00:05:05.680> to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
for some very powerful arm processors to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.380 
for some very powerful arm processors to
be<00:05:05.919> designed<00:05:06.220> for<00:05:06.580> laptop

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
be designed for laptop

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.320 
be designed for laptop
I<00:05:08.130> think<00:05:09.130> they<00:05:09.220> should<00:05:09.400> be<00:05:09.700> we<00:05:09.970> should<00:05:10.000> be<00:05:10.240> at

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
I think they should be we should be at

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.050 
I think they should be we should be at
that<00:05:10.480> time<00:05:10.690> now

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
that time now

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.439 
that time now
I<00:05:13.060> mean<00:05:13.930> let's<00:05:14.139> face<00:05:15.039> it<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.490> somebody<00:05:16.090> have

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
I mean let's face it if somebody have

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.170 
I mean let's face it if somebody have
this<00:05:16.720> laptop<00:05:16.870> or<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:18.159> powerful<00:05:18.759> enough<00:05:18.940> vision

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
this laptop or a powerful enough vision

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.300 
this laptop or a powerful enough vision
machine<00:05:19.720> on<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.020> laptop<00:05:20.289> today<00:05:20.770> we<00:05:20.979> wouldn't<00:05:21.220> be

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
machine on a laptop today we wouldn't be

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.559 
machine on a laptop today we wouldn't be
doing<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.610> would<00:05:21.789> be<00:05:21.879> going<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.150> buying<00:05:22.389> that

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
doing this would be going to buying that

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.290 
doing this would be going to buying that
and<00:05:23.530> until<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:23.919> until<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:24.759> arrives<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.270> the

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
and until that until that arrives on the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.540 
and until that until that arrives on the
market<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:25.960> guess<00:05:26.800> we're<00:05:26.979> gonna<00:05:27.069> have<00:05:27.159> to<00:05:27.280> do<00:05:27.430> it

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
market I guess we're gonna have to do it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.040 
market I guess we're gonna have to do it
ourselves<00:05:27.580> so<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.120> said<00:05:28.449> that<00:05:28.599> eight<00:05:28.750> eight

the skills needed it's just purely a

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.790 
the skills needed it's just purely a
case<00:05:58.509> of<00:05:58.780> going<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.169> finding<00:05:59.530> appropriate

hardware and making things work so when

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.100 
hardware and making things work so when
you<00:06:02.110> have<00:06:02.259> the<00:06:02.409> SOC<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:02.860> somebody<00:06:03.520> says<00:06:03.699> okay

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
you have the SOC and somebody says okay

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.600 
you have the SOC and somebody says okay
how<00:06:05.110> long<00:06:05.229> times<00:06:05.469> you<00:06:05.590> need<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.949> get<00:06:06.099> it<00:06:06.219> out

how long was a peacemaker service in
giving<00:06:13.780> everything<00:06:14.020> works<00:06:14.349> we<00:06:14.560> were

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
laptop form factor for our first board

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.870 
laptop form factor for our first board
once<00:06:25.509> we've<00:06:25.690> got<00:06:25.719> that<00:06:25.900> board<00:06:26.259> we<00:06:26.469> will<00:06:26.620> learn

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
once we've got that board we will learn

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.249 
once we've got that board we will learn
we'll<00:06:27.880> all<00:06:28.240> learn<00:06:28.389> from<00:06:28.449> our<00:06:28.659> mistakes<00:06:28.719> but

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
we'll all learn from our mistakes but

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.830 
we'll all learn from our mistakes but
that'll<00:06:29.590> be<00:06:29.710> one<00:06:29.889> spin<00:06:30.240> hopefully<00:06:31.240> the<00:06:31.389> second

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
that'll be one spin hopefully the second

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.659 
that'll be one spin hopefully the second
iteration<00:06:32.259> of<00:06:32.710> pcbs<00:06:33.279> will<00:06:33.940> be<00:06:34.090> enough<00:06:34.449> to<00:06:34.690> feed

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
iteration of pcbs will be enough to feed

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.589 
iteration of pcbs will be enough to feed
the<00:06:36.669> immediate<00:06:38.370> developer<00:06:39.370> base<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:40.150> maybe<00:06:40.389> we

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
the immediate developer base so maybe we

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.450 
the immediate developer base so maybe we
build<00:06:40.840> 10<00:06:41.169> to<00:06:41.289> 20<00:06:41.560> units<00:06:41.830> because<00:06:42.009> by<00:06:42.159> then<00:06:42.340> i

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
build 10 to 20 units because by then i

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.480 
build 10 to 20 units because by then i
would<00:06:42.879> expect<00:06:43.139> VA<00:06:44.139> will<00:06:44.440> have<00:06:44.529> grown<00:06:44.770> to<00:06:45.159> sort

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490

comparable<00:07:31.560> with<00:07:31.770> the<00:07:31.950> workstations<00:07:32.610> and<00:07:32.820> the

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
comparable with the workstations and the

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.970 
comparable with the workstations and the
the<00:07:33.360> faster<00:07:33.810> laptops<00:07:34.350> are<00:07:34.470> people<00:07:34.740> are<00:07:34.800> using

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:34.980 
the faster laptops are people are using

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.550 
the faster laptops are people are using
today<00:07:35.190> core<00:07:35.610> i7<00:07:35.760> stuff<00:07:36.420> that<00:07:36.630> absolutely<00:07:37.320> does

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
today core i7 stuff that absolutely does

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.170 
today core i7 stuff that absolutely does
kind<00:07:37.860> of<00:07:37.920> thing<00:07:38.070> we're<00:07:38.190> looking<00:07:38.220> for<00:07:38.670> if<00:07:38.940> we

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
kind of thing we're looking for if we

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.360 
kind of thing we're looking for if we
can<00:07:39.360> if<00:07:39.690> we<00:07:39.720> can<00:07:40.020> match<00:07:40.200> that<00:07:40.230> but<00:07:40.800> on<00:07:40.950> powered

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
can if we can match that but on powered

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.650 
can if we can match that but on powered
so<00:07:41.550> people<00:07:41.820> are<00:07:41.910> doing<00:07:42.120> native<00:07:42.420> development

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 
so people are doing native development

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.230 
so people are doing native development
for<00:07:43.230> their<00:07:43.350> day-to-day<00:07:43.560> arm<00:07:44.040> stuff<00:07:44.340> we've<00:07:45.060> won

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
for their day-to-day arm stuff we've won

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.060 
for their day-to-day arm stuff we've won
that's<00:07:45.840> exactly<00:07:46.020> what<00:07:46.320> we<00:07:46.440> want<00:07:46.590> to<00:07:46.680> do<00:07:46.770> and

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.070 
that's exactly what we want to do and

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.800 
that's exactly what we want to do and
then<00:07:47.220> although<00:07:47.790> the<00:07:47.940> neuro<00:07:48.150> engineers<00:07:48.600> will

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
then although the neuro engineers will

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.080 
then although the neuro engineers will
be<00:07:48.930> dark<00:07:49.230> fooding<00:07:49.680> arm<00:07:49.920> will<00:07:50.790> be<00:07:50.820> actually

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090 
be dark fooding arm will be actually

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.140 
be dark fooding arm will be actually
using<00:07:51.600> that<00:07:51.720> forever<00:07:52.320> hope<00:07:52.560> so<00:07:52.800> yeah<00:07:53.150> that's

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.150 
using that forever hope so yeah that's

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.600 
using that forever hope so yeah that's
exactly<00:07:54.300> what<00:07:54.660> what<00:07:54.780> fun<00:07:54.990> is<00:07:55.110> I<00:07:55.350> mean<00:07:56.010> the<00:07:56.430> key

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
exactly what what fun is I mean the key

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.520 
exactly what what fun is I mean the key
is<00:07:56.790> to<00:07:56.820> be<00:07:57.120> able<00:07:57.210> to<00:07:57.390> compile<00:07:57.780> native<00:07:58.230> your<00:07:58.410> own

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.530 
is to be able to compile native your own

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.310 
is to be able to compile native your own
application<00:07:58.880> at<00:07:59.880> the<00:08:00.060> moment<00:08:00.390> much<00:08:01.080> of<00:08:01.230> that

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.320 
application at the moment much of that

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.180 
application at the moment much of that
is<00:08:01.500> don't<00:08:01.680> cross<00:08:01.860> compilation<00:08:03.800> yeah<00:08:04.800> each<00:08:05.010> of

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.190 
is don't cross compilation yeah each of

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.640 
is don't cross compilation yeah each of
our<00:08:05.280> dog<00:08:05.460> food
