00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.769
 hello friends 95 bringing you a new one 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 did studies in berja are about the 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:15.660
 new interface of the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.860
 the option to play online and good here 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.820
 there is the image that tells us or does 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.360
 approximately 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.360
 like 4 or 5 hours ago 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.500
 and it was at 3 in the morning hours 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.430
 mexico and then look at how we do 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.710
 bring 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 is something different than what there was 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.170
 taught previously, we see that 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 brings the option of back the news and the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.530
 deep 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 I imagine that the new one is to create a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.820
 new map or it will not be edited if it is 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:02.940
 change your name or the world you have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 and as we see here there are 44 servers that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.560
 has opens all 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.570
 the truth I do not know if by acquiring our 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.170
 servers we can have several at the same time 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170
 I dont know 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 and it's still good I do not know how 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.210
 acquire the servers as they are going to be 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.170
 you have to buy it server I do not know how 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.540
 acquire it 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.660
 if anyone knows please leave it here 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.880
 down in the comments and well then 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.920
 They saw this is different from the previous 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 now is that I have not taught previous 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 let's teach alone 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.220
 is quite different from the ones we 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.220
 have previously taught 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.280
 lament 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 and also 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.540
 but here I have a little 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.480
 allows me 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.990
 you are not seeing the image that is ending 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.750
 of twitter and well this is the one that we 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.670
 I had previously taught because it looks 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.700
 quite different what I see here 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 bring the option of local that is wifi 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.820
 and the service of this third place and 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 well here not here nothing else brings us the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.459
 servers I do not know if to give back he does not send 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.630
 to the option of local make it an option 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.350
 in this here of the pepper play in roland 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 this that send us to local or are real 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.200
 and well I really do not know, I hope that we 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.240
 remove another image from the visualization and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.110
 it looks good the comparison of the first 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.210
 if in exchange for this from the first of the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.440
 we have this one right now 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.360
 and from this one and from this one to this one 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
 I imagine that this can also change 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.040
 this 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.879
 I imagine this will also change not 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.879
 I think it's like that, coffee, how are you? 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.739
 how is it like what we have right now 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.610
 I imagine that it will change just like this 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.519
 the new one so it seems more to me because I know and 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.610
 Well, well, I like it a lot and 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.989

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.300

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.280
