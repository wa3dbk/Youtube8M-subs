00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good jump two friends to six os 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.730
 you have learned that the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 generation there will be no more generation 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.309
 already as soon as the ps4 comes out I have it juan 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.670
 you will not see the generation in fact anymore 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 it is a proven fact and that is not to say in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.460
 how much ps4 comes out of all the ps3 's 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.160
 our houses are going to disappear 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.810
 they are going to make a protocol inside 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.509
 a deactivation protocol and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.550
 self-destruction a safety thing 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.619
 that as soon as it leaves at 10 and 4 in 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.239
 no heavy plate melt the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.829
 circuits of the console and we're not going to 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.559
 to be able to play so everything he knows 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.890
 found lately I'm sorry it 's van 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 apparently they are throwing material that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.059
 now in November fades bears 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 undo the hands you are going to take a 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.329
 box 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.329
 this is an exaggeration I am 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.280
 living but that's how it will go up 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.460
 many people out there overcome the new 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.440
 generation or my god 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 during I took you out that it does not end 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.720
 boys did not take out something nintendo if it's 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 of those companies that as soon as it announces 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 the new console to the previous the battle 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.100
 forgets but these companies that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.409
 we know at least they are and they are 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.680
 having their consoles alive after 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 install a fashion look ps2 is the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.670
 example that comes to my head 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 like the psp that has still been of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.830
 many people play and are consoles 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.710
 than 34 years after a new 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.840
 generation there they continue to give 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.299
 offering returns I do not mean 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.700
 that the playstation prepared so much with 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.700
 a friend as well presented breaks 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.080
 also as if we ignore that and we 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.080
 we put in the situation of the console 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.179
 I have to play and I'm a little bit 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.400
 the games of the euphoric I'm not going to 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.950
 call now let's call the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.060
 euphoric because everyone does 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 got all we are very free 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.239
 if it is not very good but what need 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 I have to get into vital oil and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.400
 start reading those that the relationship is 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.530
 just let's see in fundamentals have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.360
 decreed to finish have decreed that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.190
 you're going to stop throwing games I think 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.040
 it's not I think they have not even announced 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.590
 the cessation of protection or a transfer 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.420
 of ps from a car since you are not 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.420
 forcing the other 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.930
 they are not forcing you to the environment of the sun 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.550
 therefore where does that come from 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.190
 need to say that the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.480
 scientific generation melo of some 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.730
 way 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.129
 I already say if it were nintendo it would not be necessary 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.950
 that nobody certifies me if he jumps to the 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.490
 view that nintendo kills consoles 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.010
 but 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.140
 I do not know, I do not know how you see 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.580
 cookies ratio of amortized but what 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.300
 that I very little I still lack 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.450
 so much to try I started the same thing and that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.430
 is another that quiet I know that on the pc not 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.220
 there are next geniuses you have to the users 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.430
 of pc we can still continue playing 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.990
 before and not so such a big change and not 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.990
 waiting for your requirements 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.770
 each every six years like six guys 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.370
 years really the field model 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.370
 condemned of another song 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.780
 and still does not know half 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.180
 in short I do not know you can give your opinion 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.180
 here with me what do you think this wave 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.400
 of euphoric is not a lack of respect 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.380
 Care is a feature that characterizes them 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.910
 is well folic , therefore they are the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.510
 euphoric 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.640
 and nothing 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.709
 I thought to buy some console 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.390
 this generation because I would follow 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.159
 giving this generation still though 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.069
 come out another because it is the most people 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.480
 is playing more 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.760
 the image that we say 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.820
 with you to when it will not continue current 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.169
 until the others are fine because I 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.169
 for four hundred shoulders 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.729
 another issue by the way at the end of the video 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.099
 it's coming 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.100
 a wave of unboxing looming 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:38.240
 shits 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.190
 and later a silver tube of toxic and 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.420
 I write encouragement to import because yes 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.760
 it will have been a boxing that I will not 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.680
 tell anything interesting but they are going to 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 do a post investment of the box and that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 it's very beautiful I'm going to show you a little 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.180
 has the person is tested first 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.520
 before talking about it what it brings that 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.990
 it does not bring if they act like that, but that's 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.940
 first day you obviously will not be able to 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.490
 know how you are going to do the unboxing the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.030
 first day when we buy you to 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.980
 interested because you do not open my work 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.980
 but let's leave it there 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.660
 because the truth is not 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.669
 I do not know if the whole truth but part of the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.770
 truth yes I'm saying so 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.280
 nothing friends a big hug and see you 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.280
 see you
