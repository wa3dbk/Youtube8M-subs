00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello welcome be youtube friends 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.180
 and today I'm going to tell 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.400
 3 history 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.770
 good as we did this story is 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.480
 similar to the bard's suicide similar to 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.130
 the stories of the losses chapter 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.100
 of programs 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.190
 this is the legend 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.920
 Being a genoa and some subject pixar 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.960
 author and who should not have seen 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.320
 here your words I did not find more 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.270
 details about this to health 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.000
 the words of man 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.450
 I can never forget that day that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 all my perspective changed forever 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 I thought everything was forgotten but 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 they have to take out the third part 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.210
 everyone loves this movie for me is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 disgusting 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.740
 I can not believe how successful he has been 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 I mean the famous trilogy of three 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.300
 story 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.480
 very few of us know the true ones 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.250
 origins of this recreation brand was 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.930
 in the year 1991 when this show started 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.000
 pixar wanted to change the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.880
 public in which you are focused with your 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 productions and disney originated by the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.190
 text of the lion king 'wanted to change moral 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 How it worked in a more adult market 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.380
 and how no employee will be given 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 maintenance pays very well but they passed 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.540
 some things that should say like 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 pixar had planned a story I do not know 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 know by whom was created by 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.680
 supposedly this would be a work 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.320
 teacher in history 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.390
 this was just a short before passing it 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.650
 theaters had to see the halls 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.790
 of people and give their life 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.159
 in exchange for money like I needed 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.530
 accept without hesitation terrible mistake 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 the initial cut of a lullaby 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.539
 very macabre andy's room is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.789
 dark and the small letters are 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.930
 they reached to distinguish in the letters 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.100
 from toy story 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.860
 for the technology that was had was a 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.040
 very poor animation but being just one 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.040
 test 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.830
 the room was illuminated 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 crying but in a more than real way 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.130
 a profound and contagious act 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.270
 sadness the music was silent and could only be heard 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.790
 crying 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.250
 this happened for about two minutes 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.010
 the crying ends and a discussion sounds 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.159
 the take andy parents change 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.200
 discussing at the edge of the stairs the 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.359
 mother and she obviously looks pregnant 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.659
 dialogues are not distinguished just hear 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.390
 screams the take back to andy taking 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.420
 diabetes water and they start to play with 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.790
 those betinho brought their characteristics 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.970
 of sheep while woods smiled 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.030
 macabrely then andy takes a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.790
 barbie although this simulated apparently to 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.859
 parents are arguing until 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.489
 james beattie and they start hitting 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.400
 the other two dolls in that sounds a 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.770
 scream heartbreaking the shot changes the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.080
 discussion of the parents of anv 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.810
 his father physically throwing his mother 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.000
 of the stairs and this one hit in 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.160
 repeatedly and ends up lying on 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.440
 the floor surrounded by a pool of blood 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.020
 extremely real 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.750
 I start in the many cries of a baby 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.010
 these screams are expected every time we are 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.010
 with stronger directions 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 so 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.569
 anibal where the father of the powder 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.819
 great who realizes what 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.319
 it happens with a knife under his bed 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.470
 and he throws himself against his mother 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.730
 the cries of these are heartbreaking and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.769
 they go directly into your mind 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.390
 as if this unfortunate person 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.480
 I was in the same room as 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.510
 we the father is dead but 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.580
 Andean continues to penetrate with the knife 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.930
 then he carries his father's arm and what 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.329
 spear 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.729
 old where his mother is and thrown in 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.650
 standing apparently dead the cries of 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.650
 baby become increasingly sensitive and 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.840
 real at this moment the shot changes 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.270
 for a picture of a baby because its 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.550
 need without arms or legs and a 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.350
 man starts to choke up 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.960
 that the baby is home and the writings are 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.120
 similar to those in the animation where 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.610
 go up the stairs with his two parents 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.000
 dead go back to your room and take 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.729
 a and hugs him this Andean revive for 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.220
 go miss him wood and get up and 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.060
 begins to console him saying that this one 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.130
 I had to use our fault once 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.470
 andy threw herself to the floor and started crying 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.030
 and whipping his head on the floor until 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.030
 it starts to bleed 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.930
 so while it gets closer under the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.460
 bed and I know another knife is coming 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.770
 flying and lifts the knife in the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.800
 moment he says this had to happen 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.110
 once the shot turned black and 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.680
 only a desperate child is invited 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.030
 for about five minutes 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.610
 ends with the picture a real boy at 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.250
 seem stabbed and in the same 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.790
 conditions that the baby without arms or 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.880
 legs 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.250
 then ended the silence was 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.950
 inevitable the pixar executives are 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.500
 they went and they accepted a furious door 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.870
 of the other three people all are 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.450
 they were running me no sir is immobile 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.280
 and broke up while I went in the 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.830
 time to leave the room a 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.200
 man apologized and told me that 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.930
 I said nothing of this that I would investigate 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.820
 the case they later thorium and went to the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.220
 light with a mystery very different from the 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.800
 original best recording quality and 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.320
 sound but seeing the characters is 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.230
 It reminds me of that horrible occasion where 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.230
 the dreams of a madman materialized 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.650
 the most innocent thing in the world of 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.110
 toys a child 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.780
 now toy story3 of goodies with the 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.850
 same innocent story but the mystery 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.370
 that I heard maybe five other people from 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.199
 I never knew what happened to them 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.020
 for my part it disgusts me that so many people 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.009
 follow this macabre creation that he had in 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.319
 its origins the terror 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.880
 well this was all I saw happening 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.710
 today I hope you enjoy it 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.710
 and good still watching videos
