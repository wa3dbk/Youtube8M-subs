00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
couldn't be bothered mucking around with

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
couldn't be bothered mucking around with
us<00:01:40.960> up<00:01:41.229> just<00:01:41.260> dissipating<00:01:41.950> like<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
us up just dissipating like this and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.410 
us up just dissipating like this and
yeah<00:01:45.130> my<00:01:45.340> custom<00:01:45.760> piece<00:01:45.940> which<00:01:46.120> I've<00:01:46.240> done<00:01:46.390> a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
yeah my custom piece which I've done a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.680 
yeah my custom piece which I've done a
review<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.920> light<00:01:48.160> up<00:01:48.310> Batman<00:01:48.670> symbol

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.890 

which<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.900> think<00:01:53.410> matches<00:01:53.770> up<00:01:53.920> very<00:01:54.190> nicely<00:01:55.090> as

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
which I think matches up very nicely as

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.370 
which I think matches up very nicely as
you<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.590> tell<00:01:56.800> here<00:01:57.040> it's<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.960> tad<00:01:58.960> bigger<00:01:59.200> than

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
you can tell here it's a tad bigger than

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.710 
you can tell here it's a tad bigger than
quarter<00:01:59.710> scale<00:01:59.950> as<00:02:00.250> as<00:02:00.759> with<00:02:01.119> all<00:02:01.240> my<00:02:01.420> stuff

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
quarter scale as as with all my stuff

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.749 
quarter scale as as with all my stuff
but<00:02:02.050> still<00:02:02.500> looks<00:02:02.710> really<00:02:03.100> really<00:02:03.310> good<00:02:03.340> next

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
but still looks really really good next
