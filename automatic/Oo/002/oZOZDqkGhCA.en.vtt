00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.850 
always has that special same taste to it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
right the special flavor to it which I

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860 
right the special flavor to it which I
like<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:34.750> about<00:03:35.650> 300<00:03:36.540> milligrams<00:03:37.540> less

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
like so it's about 300 milligrams less

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.400 
like so it's about 300 milligrams less
sodium<00:03:38.700> then<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.120> college<00:03:40.900> junior<00:03:41.110> is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
sodium then the college junior is

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.840 
sodium then the college junior is
offering<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:43.000> it's<00:03:43.840> also<00:03:44.019> cheaper<00:03:44.590> by<00:03:44.860> about

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
offering and it's also cheaper by about

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.340 
offering and it's also cheaper by about
30<00:03:46.480> cents<00:03:47.040> covering<00:03:48.040> 329<00:03:48.810> Wiener<00:03:49.810> schnitzels

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.220 
30 cents covering 329 Wiener schnitzels
$2.99<00:03:52.920> also<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.980> get<00:03:54.459> like<00:03:54.880> slightly<00:03:55.330> less<00:03:55.720> of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
$2.99 also you get like slightly less of

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.440 
$2.99 also you get like slightly less of
the<00:03:56.530> cheese<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.400> chili<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.239> then<00:03:58.390> you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the cheese and the chili but then you

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.449 
the cheese and the chili but then you
get<00:03:58.570> less<00:03:58.750> fries<00:03:59.050> so<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.350> guess<00:03:59.650> that's<00:03:59.950> about

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
get less fries so I guess that's about

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.220 
get less fries so I guess that's about
even<00:04:00.970> covers<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.860> schedule<00:04:03.160> 1<00:04:03.190> 100<00:04:04.230> now

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
even covers it so in schedule 1 100 now

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.640 
even covers it so in schedule 1 100 now
I<00:04:05.260> gave<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.850> covering<00:04:06.850> at<00:04:07.000> 60%<00:04:07.359> this<00:04:08.079> will

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
I gave the covering at 60% this will

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.760 
I gave the covering at 60% this will
probably<00:04:08.980> get<00:04:09.600> 70%

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
probably get 70%

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.100 
probably get 70%
so<00:04:12.250> if<00:04:12.550> they<00:04:12.670> could<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:13.060> lower<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.660> sodium

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
so if they could just lower the sodium

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.020 
so if they could just lower the sodium
content<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:14.890> would<00:04:15.100> be<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.520> lot<00:04:15.850> better

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
content and this would be a lot better

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.420 
content and this would be a lot better
