00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.450
 hello my name is anton channel 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.299
 denote today i 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:20.529
 I will review the model for omsi even I 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.960
 I do not know most likely maz-103 075 under 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.000
 rework rework on trolley 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.090
 let's probably start with 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.059
 from the outside it looks quite enough 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.460
 looks like it seems to me as far as I am 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.160
 certainly not be seen but when looked there 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.950
 reviews some mean there until about 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.559
 reality is kind of like in my opinion 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.540
 just know that this alteration vsmysle 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.960
 the sounds are simply changed and attached 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.000
 Here are all these as I called personal belongings 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.700
 let's go to the salon if 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.210
 Outside, only here are the tins open 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.210
 so here is how then hatches stage 4 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.989
 This does not work then there is a pull 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.320
 such here 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.059
 emergency emergency I do not know how it is 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.479
 correctly called now like this 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.190
 called 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.580
 emergency opening of the door here is our 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.360
 animated now i'll show you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.690
 there. jerked him so apple obviously 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.690
 from seen 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.820
 although perhaps we will pass the salon in the salon 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.240
 and all as in Moses the 30 seventy 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.130
 there are no five differences 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.190
 This small bug is such that vodka 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.740
 it is over that there is no glass here at all 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 Well what can I say here if 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
 it would be very nice if you were 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.729
 a little bit other seat room not 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.649
 seating on the texture then they somehow 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.740
 you know not such masonry here they are 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.380
 in another look not even visible where 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.390
 they sing goes back and then seats 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.399
 but you probably let's go to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.060
 cabin as in the cabin here to review 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.640
 almost nothing like minecraft 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.970
 sun to and let's move on to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.369
 cockpit matt in the cockpit of all sorts of buns 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.880
 there is only such a sign and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.610
 nothing more, I probably put 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.810
 then sorry for skype so 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.180
 then 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.739
 as usual, these things are even 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.530
 it is good that not two sides to me this 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.250
 like a cart everything opens well 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.130
 here here is the air conditioner now 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.849
 now the guard is working here is only 1 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.880
 key and for example here it all works 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.610
 perhaps finish all this without 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.610
 as far as I understand it is and without but I and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.830
 without and I do not even know how to use 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.360
 so what about the buttons, I'm nothing 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.860
 I can not say that these two 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.250
 buttons I just got it all 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.190
 yes it turns out this is a winding up this 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.810
 stun 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 Yes 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.160
 this wind up so this wind up 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.170
 it is jammed then this is further 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.800
 electronics there and without any radius to 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.640
 then this is the light in the cabin 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.480
 it is heated mirrors it is the light in the cabin 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.800
 the driver 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.410
 there it is dipped and lights 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.740
 appliances 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.030
 then it 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.140
 anti tumanki this is not anime nana nanan 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.880
 no benefit 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.830
 Well, for you can you know write 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 tried to comment there it is 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 door lock 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 automatic locking here and here it is a microphone 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.670
 there must be a type but it works i'm not here 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 know how about 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.470
 hard hat route 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.450
 you understand what I maintained upstream, though perhaps 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.799
 let's start 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:53.180
 let's try how he drives as i get there 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.609
 summarize liked the stones 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.129
 well see here half the sounds are almost that 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.270
 all sounds adjutant have it at the door 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.720
 there 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.450
 beasts there for example amazon sounds but 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.220
 so quite all its ziua de sounds 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.990
 do but I don't know maybe they and 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.000
 reality very similar sounds on me 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.380
 it seems that u do not have something 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.690
 differences so what i'm thinking might need 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.810
 spend lat's play on it i want 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.250
 most likely either by mac with or by 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.110
 bro you write me what's better and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.450
 write to do not and I have such a review 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.410
 He is not a review of gold is possible and an overview 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.950
 call lat's play 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.000
 where will i be and 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.980
 you name me some card and i will 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.320
 run on it all the routes even 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.050
 most likely I will ask you to me 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.520
 wrote on which bus first which 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.500
 card and then which bus on which 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.070
 route right now we will go I will tell 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.310
 I will summarize here how I liked 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.310
 or 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.040
 I don't even know what to talk to you 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.750
 let's probably 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.110
 channel I already in many videos that 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.740
 telling 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.740
 the fact that 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.510
 he asked to write in the comments 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.180
 I do not know whether you respond or not 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.300
 so here 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.970
 I will wait and then if you write well 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.050
 it just comes out on it I don't know maybe 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:30.680
 in a day march in two 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:34.789
 but about this wire with play for any 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.280
 card then I will wait for your yours 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.889
 offers without your offers video 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.410
 the next one will not come exactly letsplay on 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.160
 you will not quit until you write want 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.690
 but one bus and one card 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.699
 here's favor to give us the same already 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.650
 will turn can eat come 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.040
 Now we will park there, well, straight 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.390
 just on the road 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.390
 we have just 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.390
 and 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.770
 and here is a double beep 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.770
 Well, you no longer have to miss 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.660
 let's eat 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.850
 with you guys come 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.940
 stop 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.220
 where this one opens is as uncomfortable as 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.220
 and there are no differences in the mass of 103 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.669
 and those i will summarize well what can i 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.020
 tell me personally as in the most and 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.849
 very few trolley buses I understand that 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.349
 This bus inspection but still for some reason 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.090
 I want but for these decent 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.719
 trolleybus simulator yet by me 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.909
 It seems that they did not come up like msi 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:49.009
 so here I am, everything is a trolley bus here 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.319
 like yet more while that same 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:56.000
 like because strength and how is Adele 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:56.900
 or specifically for just whether model 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.400
 just under the zil 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.830
 and this one just take the usual masses and 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.110
 redistribution by trolley bus but I think by 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.229
 a ten point scale I have this trolley bus 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.199
 I'll put about 80 half 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.599
 at eight or eight half since 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.729
 I do not really like everything here what 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:20.120
 here it’s just that it’s stuck and that ’s it 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:24.110
 no changes in the cockpit there is nowhere 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.550
 and sounds are taken from strength so if you 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.439
 like this video subscribe to 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.180
