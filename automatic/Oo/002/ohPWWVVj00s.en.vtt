00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you want to fold on those lines so that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.860 
you want to fold on those lines so that
it

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
it

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.600

shape so and then what you want to do is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.800 
shape so and then what you want to do is
flip<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.220> over<00:01:58.470> they<00:01:59.470> look<00:01:59.680> like<00:01:59.710> this<00:02:00.810> now

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
flip it over they look like this now

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.690 
flip it over they look like this now
we're<00:02:02.050> going<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.320> do<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> same<00:02:02.950> thing<00:02:03.370> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
we're going to do the same thing the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.460 
we're going to do the same thing the
flappy<00:02:03.970> cider<00:02:04.360> at<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.960> bottom<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:07.440> crease<00:02:08.440> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
flappy cider at the bottom and crease it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.720 
flappy cider at the bottom and crease it
in<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.010> there's<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.479> point<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
in so that there's a point on on the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.300 
in so that there's a point on on the
flabby<00:02:13.060> side<00:02:13.650> pull<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.800> down<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
flabby side pull this down so that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.110 
flabby side pull this down so that
there's<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.790> crease<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.910> want<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there's a crease and then you want to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
there's a crease and then you want to
fold<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> crease<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:23.430> fold<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
fold it up on the crease now fold on the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.710 
fold it up on the crease now fold on the
dotted<00:02:25.000> lines<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.580> got<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:29.400> diamonds

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
dotted lines then you got to diamonds

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.010 
dotted lines then you got to diamonds
done<00:02:34.080> X<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.500> want<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.280> flip<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> up

if<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.370> flip<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> over<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.709> want<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
if you flip it over then you want to

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.690 
if you flip it over then you want to
keep<00:02:54.400> folding<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.030> in<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.860> want<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.220> press<00:02:57.520> it

keep folding it in you want to press it

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.740 
keep folding it in you want to press it
down<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:59.530> will<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> keep<00:03:01.239> going<00:03:01.540> down

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
down and it will go to keep going down

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
down and it will go to keep going down
and<00:03:02.170> don't<00:03:02.950> go<00:03:03.160> like<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.980> want<00:03:06.160> to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and don't go like this then you want to

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.250 
and don't go like this then you want to
take<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.550> from<00:03:06.970> then<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.570> want<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.840> flip<00:03:07.989> this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
take it from then you want to flip this

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.970 
take it from then you want to flip this
over<00:03:08.470> i'll<00:03:09.070> go<00:03:09.310> up<00:03:09.900> your<00:03:10.900> flip<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> back<00:03:11.680> down

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
over i'll go up your flip it back down

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.660 
over i'll go up your flip it back down
want<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> flip<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.480> part<00:03:13.810> over<00:03:13.959> again<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
want to flip this part over again to the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.509 
want to flip this part over again to the
side<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.209> then<00:03:16.420> flip<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.959> down<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:18.220> you've

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
side and then flip it down now you've

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.640 
side and then flip it down now you've
got<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.510> gets<00:03:19.840> pretty<00:03:19.900> simple<00:03:20.440> here

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
got this it gets pretty simple here

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.800 
got this it gets pretty simple here
because<00:03:21.580> all<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.820> have<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.300> fold<00:03:22.600> this

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
because all you have to do is fold this

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.030 
because all you have to do is fold this
part<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:24.390> fold<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.570> part<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.200> inside<00:03:26.709> but

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
part in fold this part on the inside but

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.680 
part in fold this part on the inside but
there's<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.550> be<00:03:27.610> no<00:03:27.910> lines<00:03:28.269> for<00:03:28.600> this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
there's going to be no lines for this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.030 
there's going to be no lines for this
part<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.650> may<00:03:29.920> get<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.190> little<00:03:30.250> bit<00:03:30.640> tricky

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
part so it may get a little bit tricky

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.650 
part so it may get a little bit tricky
then<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.190> want<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.430> fold<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.880> back<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.940> now

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
then you want to fold it back to and now

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.400 
then you want to fold it back to and now
we're<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.170> make<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:39.010> ear<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:41.140> we're

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
we're going to make a the ear now we're

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.140 
we're going to make a the ear now we're
going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.620> fold<00:03:41.890> this<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.340> front<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.800> there

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
going to fold this up front and there

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.280 
going to fold this up front and there
and<00:03:46.150> it's<00:03:46.570> kind<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.470> hard<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.739> do<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:49.290> there's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and it's kind of hard to do and there's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.030 
and it's kind of hard to do and there's
one<00:03:50.650> ear<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.180> years<00:03:52.739> now<00:03:53.739> all<00:03:53.920> you

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
