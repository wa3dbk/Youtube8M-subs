know it's just it's just one of those
things<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.490> think<00:05:39.820> it's<00:05:39.940> good<00:05:40.090> for

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
things and I think it's good for

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.910 
things and I think it's good for
everyone<00:05:40.450> so<00:05:41.050> do<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:41.230> think<00:05:41.290> Black<00:05:41.680> Ops<00:05:41.830> is

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
everyone so do you think Black Ops is

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.080

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.750 
gonna be back to the modern warfare 2
uh-oh<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.230> think<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.800> colony<00:05:45.220> black<00:05:45.400> ops<00:05:45.610> is

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760
