research scientist in Pasadena
California<00:00:10.880> let's<00:00:11.880> talk<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
California let's talk about how to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.829 
California let's talk about how to
determine<00:00:13.290> how<00:00:14.040> many<00:00:14.099> moles<00:00:14.490> there<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.509> in

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
determine how many moles there are in

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.000 
determine how many moles there are in
one<00:00:16.230> liter<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.830> water<00:00:17.480> when<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> chemist<00:00:19.010> talks

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
one liter of water when a chemist talks

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.670 
one liter of water when a chemist talks
about<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> mole<00:00:20.990> he's<00:00:21.990> saying<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
about a mole he's saying this is a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.300 
about a mole he's saying this is a
certain<00:00:23.160> number<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.869> molecules<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.230> atoms<00:00:25.800> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
certain number of molecules or atoms and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.959 
certain number of molecules or atoms and
that<00:00:26.939> number<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:31.399> would<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> continue

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that number is I would have to continue

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.100 
that number is I would have to continue
and<00:00:33.120> write<00:00:33.420> another<00:00:33.719> twenty<00:00:34.260> zero<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:36.110> four

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and write another twenty zero is four

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.810 
and write another twenty zero is four
digits<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.950> instead<00:00:38.280> I'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> use

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
digits but instead I'm going to use

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.170 
digits but instead I'm going to use
scientific<00:00:39.270> notation<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> decimal

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
scientific notation so I put a decimal

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.160 
scientific notation so I put a decimal
point<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.750> decimal<00:00:43.230> point<00:00:43.500> behind<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.460> zero

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
point a decimal point behind the zero

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
point a decimal point behind the zero

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
kilogram or 1,000 grams I'm changing to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.980 
kilogram or 1,000 grams I'm changing to
grams<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:02.189> we'll<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.570> gram<00:02:03.960> weight

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
grams because we'll see the gram weight

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.709 
grams because we'll see the gram weight
of<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.890> mole<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.969> next<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.450> need<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> know

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
of a mole the next thing I need to know

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.830 
of a mole the next thing I need to know
is<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:08.099> chemical<00:02:08.429> formula<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:10.140> water<00:02:10.640> h2o

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
is the chemical formula for water h2o

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.670 
is the chemical formula for water h2o
this<00:02:12.840> means<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.440> have

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this means if I have

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
this means if I have
mol<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:13.980> water<00:02:14.219> I<00:02:14.870> will<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> mole<00:02:16.409> of

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
mol of water I will have a mole of

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.319 
mol of water I will have a mole of
oxygen<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.780> two<00:02:18.780> moles<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.290> hydrogen

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
oxygen and two moles of hydrogen

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.599 
oxygen and two moles of hydrogen
so<00:02:21.329> let's<00:02:21.569> look<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.439> what<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.799> if<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.579> a

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
so let's look up what is if I have a

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.110 
so let's look up what is if I have a
mole<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:23.969> oxygen<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.099> its<00:02:26.340> weight<00:02:26.849> or

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
mole of oxygen what is its weight or

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.910 
mole of oxygen what is its weight or
mass<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.290> grams

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
mass in grams

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.990 
mass in grams
well<00:02:29.209> carbon-12<00:02:30.209> had<00:02:30.900> 12<00:02:31.260> grams<00:02:31.819> oxygen<00:02:32.819> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
well carbon-12 had 12 grams oxygen a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.229 
well carbon-12 had 12 grams oxygen a
mole<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.079> oxygen<00:02:34.170> would<00:02:34.709> have<00:02:34.769> 16<00:02:35.400> grams

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.319 

hydrogen<00:02:39.409> has<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:41.040> atomic<00:02:41.250> weight<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.730> 1<00:02:41.969> that

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
hydrogen has the atomic weight of 1 that

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.220 
hydrogen has the atomic weight of 1 that
means<00:02:42.829> we<00:02:43.829> would<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.599> since<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.810> two<00:02:46.079> of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
means we would have since we have two of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.649 
means we would have since we have two of
them<00:02:46.849> um<00:02:47.900> two<00:02:48.900> moles<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.409> hydrogen<00:02:50.419> would<00:02:51.419> have

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
them um two moles of hydrogen would have

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.619 
them um two moles of hydrogen would have
two<00:02:52.590> grams<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.480> mass<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.470> total<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.669> a<00:02:57.389> mole

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
two grams of mass so the total of a mole

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.949 
two grams of mass so the total of a mole
of<00:02:57.810> water<00:02:58.639> one<00:02:59.639> mole<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.000> water<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.510> 18<00:03:01.349> grams

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
of water one mole of water is 18 grams

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.659 
of water one mole of water is 18 grams
so<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.019> decided<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.650> clean<00:03:04.889> up<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.159> whiteboard

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
so I decided to clean up the whiteboard

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.390 
so I decided to clean up the whiteboard
and<00:03:05.909> actually<00:03:06.659> write<00:03:06.900> out<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.799> number<00:03:08.189> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
and actually write out the number of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
and actually write out the number of
molecules<00:03:08.639> in<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> mole<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:10.680> all<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:12.680> 2002

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
molecules in a mole with all the 2002

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.969 
molecules in a mole with all the 2002
the<00:03:13.799> math<00:03:15.049> we<00:03:16.049> have<00:03:17.150> 1,000<00:03:18.150> grams<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.979> water

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
the math we have 1,000 grams of water

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:33.640 
the math we have 1,000 grams of water
and<00:03:23.030> 18<00:03:24.030> grams<00:03:25.370> per<00:03:26.370> mole<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:29.099> answer<00:03:29.549> is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.080 

fifty<00:03:34.650> five<00:03:35.370> point<00:03:35.879> six<00:03:36.949> moles<00:03:37.949> of<00:03:39.409> water<00:03:40.409> in

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
fifty five point six moles of water in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:49.470 
fifty five point six moles of water in
one<00:03:42.090> liter<00:03:43.250> thank<00:03:44.250> you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.540 

you
