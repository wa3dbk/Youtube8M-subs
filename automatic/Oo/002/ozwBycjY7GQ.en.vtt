00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.520
 it didn't look terrible in the last four games 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.580
 drama the fighter 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.489
 and wants to 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.709
 rijnsburg boys is therefore warned 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.179
 the company to shorten it 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.460
 with jeffrey winter taking in 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.179
 who are in danger of becoming 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.699
 how is granted by breinburg 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 unprecedented in the winter 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.929
 the deception and saba 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.140
 how much to give to the opponent seems to me to be a succession committee 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 this figure to twelve minutes he made the 2 0 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.160
 the stab weapon 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.340
 it no offside 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.480
 live with the match to match 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 programs 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.620
 within twelve minutes and during the time that Verdunschot was in action 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 steam train so often within twenty minutes with 2 0 in front 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.720
 but they look like it seems to him 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 it often has to do with a person's southern policy 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 the law writes le soir in a row 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.700
 it also bakkeveen 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.300
 the ordinary people seem 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300
 2 0 for one happened 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.240
 forward but with the fia 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.680
 darkened callas just watch and score a goal 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.330
 you can also refused it 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.690
 polanski forest road 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
 m tried from a distance 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 the ball over and next to the goal of bosnia 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 twitter i played soccer 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.130
 there is no offside 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 russian winter pass 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 the penalties 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.510
 but what not to assist the dyke street 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
 this is another penalty it's winter past goalkeeper has the ball 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.459
 you are not looking for people in such a position for swansea retraining bonus 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.109
 this had given rijnsburg the perfect opportunity to come to 3 0 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.079
 peter freke does not mean that the specialist 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.729
 where to 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.399
 do you know what are you going to do a header 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.399
 the action seems to be a bid made by strikes 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.009
 punish a majority of the second chamber 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.359
 leijten 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.649
 here in deraa only cda he is cracked that right property old dutch property 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.179
 business there is a penalty kick 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.179
 register when not dragging on 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 that could be the second city of 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.629
 but not given badly defend this rijnsburg municipality sees man 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.629
 cares for the fingertips of o 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.799
 one of the few moments before the mountain jersey comes out 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.739
 fall into the shot at the finger tips 3 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.229
 we are getting busier 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.279
 Myrthe break is getting closer 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.279
 in the 15 questions based on truth 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.629
 surely the most dangerous man on the side of rijnsburg boys in the 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.969
 travel sixteen-meter area 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.479
 defensive work is good 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.049
 for leo ship maker but there had been more residents for rijnsburg boys 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.509
 that comes to rest with a 2 0 lead appear twice 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 names that second place was that nice 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.619
 tarantini a point 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 but big names 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.389
 new audience from hardenberg 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.459
 the half past eight girls were true that by the way believes no longer able to 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.459
 the charge fall on the hardenberg side 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.629
 also went to the hospital 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.370
 he looks at the ball, of course, the same goes for my nose 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.959
 former player of my breathing hedge 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.650
 but it remains second 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.669
 gladly 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.569
 the body uses 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.689
 Substitute the Pond Media I do to the second post 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 Norman Merkel was still 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.220
 saba search for the right leg sardar with the hideout 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.289
 there was no question but watching but the ball went wide 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.430
 the defender of hardenberg may sell to sick trees 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.809
 regarding the side net 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.949
 hardenberg played better in the second half 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.949
 he claims a goal 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.270
 the man looks in shape there 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.629
 in charge 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.240
 He has such a brilliant moments seems a bit left and the rescue of 

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.419
 the perpetrators 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.599
 but no one will blame him for that 2 0 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.870
 except plasterk a beauty 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.749
 because shooting the ball and 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.710
 that is difficult 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.860
 with his 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.499
 well what i can do what i am i just see it 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.330
 a better plan to work with this year 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.409
 yes it is a thalys between goals 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.419
 at the time the plan 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.449
 what happens normally 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.650
 you see but that it is not the site can score element in the first half 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.560
 30 minutes dinteloord may 19 another penalty yes my eyes also I think 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.980
 if you want cushions and an example for the referees what a 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.430
 pure penalty so that is it in it 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.500
 do not understand why he does not care what were then it would be a schwalbe 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.240
 should be from jef and then give new thialf a yellow card a bit either 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.530
 so i don't really know very well why it didn't give a black one 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.780
 out of a second child it was an attack over left 10 and the ball became 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.229
 he cut out no penalty reduction none at the keeper the keeper of 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.379
 outside doing the ball it wasn't playing for tomorrow 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.919
 The moment Jeffrey goes after the goalkeeper winter he runs the 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.740
 along the six the center line just within sixteen meters the keeper has the hand 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.789
 on the ground I stood on top of it he runs against the hand then the stalls 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.639
 certainly been in contact 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.729
 but it is not that intention of the keeper that it goes to his feet 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.139
 a leg against faith that he therefore falls 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:28.499
 in my opinion 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.889
 mine is that it was absolutely no penalty a moment later with leitoe 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.330
 That is also called a penalty kick 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.380
 which was also tapped outside in 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.130
 naja that we demand that also away that was less a penalty I think 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.099
 that it is with jef 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.529
 but yes if she if you give one of the two then it will be for us 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.369
 olÃ© of course 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:51.729
 yes a bit easier to play football in the second half yes I had a good view 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.729
 on the situation he comes from the right he comes in 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.199
 I hope the player from I had another player from the top ten 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.689
 we set at the same time 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.830
 and that may have been the state of affairs but not in that 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.729
 they we have laid down, he slipped away 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.830
 at times when he set the moon 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.389
 that is no reason for me to award a penalty
