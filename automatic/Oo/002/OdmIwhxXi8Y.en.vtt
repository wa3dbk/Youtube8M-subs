campaign AI in action to run perfectly

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.030 
campaign AI in action to run perfectly
like<00:02:15.240> I'm<00:02:15.660> not<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.110> guess<00:02:16.320> my<00:02:16.500> units<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
like I'm not that guess my units and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190 
like I'm not that guess my units and
extra<00:02:17.310> boost<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.820> more<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.540> lets<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:18.930> place

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
extra boost and more that lets me place

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
extra boost and more that lets me place
and<00:02:19.530> playable<00:02:19.920> factions<00:02:20.430> something<00:02:21.300> like

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and playable factions something like

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.080 
and playable factions something like
that<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.560> most<00:02:22.890> important<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.550> however<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that the most important thing however is

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
that the most important thing however is
that<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.360> entering<00:02:24.900> phase<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.740> emotes<00:02:26.070> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that the entering phase with emotes I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.120 
that the entering phase with emotes I
have<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.490> use<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.960> extremely<00:02:27.960> slow<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.590> turn

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
have to use is extremely slow in turn

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.730 
have to use is extremely slow in turn
100<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.180> entering<00:02:30.630> phase<00:02:30.900> could<00:02:31.140> take<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
100 the entering phase could take up to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.790 
100 the entering phase could take up to
15<00:02:32.370> minutes<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.540> would<00:02:33.959> get<00:02:34.170> longer<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
15 minutes and it would get longer and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.980 
15 minutes and it would get longer and
longer<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.340> every<00:02:35.640> another<00:02:36.030> turn<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.450> played<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
longer for every another turn I played I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.660 
longer for every another turn I played I
just<00:02:37.470> didn't<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.920> time<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.160> make<00:02:38.490> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
just didn't have the time to make it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.460 
just didn't have the time to make it
longer<00:02:38.970> hopefully<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:39.930> will<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.110> some<00:02:40.290> more

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
longer hopefully we will see some more

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
longer hopefully we will see some more
optimization<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.520> some<00:02:41.670> better<00:02:41.880> mods<00:02:42.209> when

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
optimization and some better mods when

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360 
optimization and some better mods when
the<00:02:42.780> Steam<00:02:43.020> Workshop<00:02:43.170> came<00:02:43.590> out<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.190> that's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the Steam Workshop came out but that's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.220 
the Steam Workshop came out but that's
the<00:02:44.490> main<00:02:44.670> reason<00:02:44.850> why<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.360> only<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.780> small

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the main reason why it's only so small
