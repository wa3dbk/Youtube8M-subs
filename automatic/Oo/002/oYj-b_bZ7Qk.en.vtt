00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 so let's start now what 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.890
 first thing we're going to do is the basis of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.319
 the tomato soup is a cream of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 tomato although it does not take cream because it gives 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.559
 creamy because then we're going to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.389
 process then here we have the pot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.340
 hot here we have the bunch of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.279
 ingredients and the first thing we're going to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 to crystallize our vegetables 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.100
 then we have sweet chili onion 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 celery and water very important when 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 you are going to prepare this cream 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 tomato try to find the tomatoes more 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.420
 mature people they find in the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 supermarket because we're going to use 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.969
 natural tomatoes and we will use 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.360
 canned tomatoes then that's how 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.360
 it is done 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.680
 and not just the video that you can download 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 the recipes after triple-double 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.490
 points now it 's point zero point cr in 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.470
 the moment you are seeing this 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.390
 program and the recipes of being there 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.800
 above net so what do you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 has to do is concentrate nothing else 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.350
 pay close attention while I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.660
 I work and you enjoy 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 to see the good spoon 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.460
 we start with the onion 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.170
 let's incorporate it into the skin 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.939
 all well minced anyway 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.369
 we will all way process but 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.890
 when you chop the ingredients 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.189
 well chopped loose its flavor is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.189
 sweet little 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 and of course you can not miss the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 cup in a good tomato cream 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.060
 There's a smell in this kitchen 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 Now all you have to have is a 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.619
 little bit of patience with the cream of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.960
 tomato because if you are a ratillo 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.579
 cooking between dry sea and other 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.079
 Concentrate tomato plus melt the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.679
 more tomato disintegrates more loose 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.829
 taste once the vegetables 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.650
 begin to crystallize or soften 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.550
 let's incorporate 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.550
 the natural tomatoes 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.240
 well chopped 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.790
 these have shell anyway 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.370
 all ways we are going to process so 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.120
 nothing happens and we are going to add 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 also the pinches of sugar so that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.490
 let's help reduce acidity a little 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.590
 canned tomato in this case is tomato 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.270
 in cubes canned with all that he played 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.130
 a pinch of sugar 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 which is also the taste of the hedge not 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.120
 It's enough to know about a tomato cream 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.120
 comes the chicken caldito 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.560
 and we are going to cook this over medium heat 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.459
 low for a little while that we are going to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.770
 add oregano and basil powder or 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.750
 dried 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.210
 the clues of each one to give him good 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.160
 taste 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.160
 let's add a little salt 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.540
 a little pepper 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.720
 and we leave it here cooking for a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.880
 I calculate that about 30 35 minutes 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 well the tomato concentrates well grabs 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.480
 good taste and then we will process 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.700
 yes at low heat so that we are not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.230
 go to put the liquid now if you 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.490
 they see that he was stopping a lot 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.000
 liquid can add a little more 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 of broth 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.570
 we go this way because we're going to do 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.550
 a mousse of asparagus and what we're going to 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.970
 to do is incorporate cream cheese light 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.440
 processor and add 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.650
 23 45 16 asparagus to process with the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.780
 cream cheese let's add a chili 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.610
 morrÃ³n 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.370
 let's put a little salt of a 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.910
 little piece of salt a little bit 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.910
 Pepper 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.459
 and to process 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.459
 ah 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.110
 these are canned asparagus what 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.060
 important here is that you discover 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.250
 well those studs because the release 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.830
 it comes as without liquid it is important that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.330
 do not be too liquid and ready, let's go 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.790
 to be able to contribute when we return 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.169
 let's start preparing also the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.850
 Sopita lentils and let's finish the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.290
 tomato soup that is delicious 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.120
 you can not miss any of this 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.979
 program that is also easy recipes 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.979
 very rich and very nutritious friends 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.400
 I want to teach them and that's it 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.139
 this tomatito come asome after a month and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.349
 look how rich it smells 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.639
 and what I 'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.659
 process 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.659
 tomato 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.710
 to make the famous cream 

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:03.240
 tomato 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.000
 and this has enough to postpone 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.000
 cooking so you're ready 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.580
 let's process well have a little cheese 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.889
 parmesan by hand because we're going to put 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.600
 the asparagus mousse with cream 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.810
 then we're going to put cheese alaska 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.810
 Parmesan 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.919
 very careful 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.419
 very well now we have to start 

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:49.219
 process little by little because this is 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:51.609
 very hot and we do not want to start with 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.609
 the press 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.639
 and our creame this life 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.150
 eye eye eye much care 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:32.590
 very well how are we going to serve these 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.640
 offers or we will serve the portion 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.640
 in the little dish 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:44.899
 and individual we are going to put a few flakes 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.899
 of parmesan cheese 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.230
 some the removes that you can 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.230
 cut with knife or peel potatoes 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.259
 we put the removes them so that 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.750
 go melting with the warmth of the 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.490
 soup let's put enough 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.569
 and then we're going to do it 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.569
 a little bit of light 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.950
 and there is his clue
