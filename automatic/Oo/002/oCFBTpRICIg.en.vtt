more protection over there and also what

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.880 
more protection over there and also what
I<00:02:32.549> did<00:02:32.909> notice<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.599> do<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
I did notice that I do like is that the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.330 
I did notice that I do like is that the
buttons<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.370> soft<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.959> they<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.799> hard

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
buttons are soft so they are not hard

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.030 
buttons are soft so they are not hard
polycarbonate<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.349> are<00:02:40.439> kind<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:40.829> soft

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
polycarbonate but they are kind of soft

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.460 
polycarbonate but they are kind of soft
and<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.970> almost<00:02:42.150> feels<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.659> when<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.349> don't

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and it almost feels like when you don't

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.190 
and it almost feels like when you don't
even<00:02:43.859> have<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> case<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:45.569> that's<00:02:46.049> something

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
even have a case on so that's something

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.170 
even have a case on so that's something
that<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.590> some<00:02:47.069> case<00:02:47.310> manufacturer<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that you see some case manufacturer and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
that you see some case manufacturer and
not<00:02:48.810> thinking<00:02:49.230> about<00:02:49.409> too<00:02:49.560> much<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
not thinking about too much that you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.059 
not thinking about too much that you
still<00:02:50.459> want<00:02:50.639> to<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.819> pretty<00:02:51.420> easy

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
still want to have pretty easy

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.580 
still want to have pretty easy
up-and-down<00:02:53.069> keys<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:54.230> volume<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.530> down

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
up-and-down keys and volume up and down

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.800 
up-and-down keys and volume up and down
but<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.700> still<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.299> have<00:02:57.510> some

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
but you still want to have some

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.339 
but you still want to have some
protection

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.229 

so<00:03:01.349> one<00:03:02.220> thing<00:03:02.459> though<00:03:02.639> is<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.790> when<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
so one thing though is that when you

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.449 
so one thing though is that when you
take<00:03:03.389> it<00:03:03.540> off<00:03:03.659> could<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.829> little<00:03:05.010> bit<00:03:05.189> hard

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
take it off could be a little bit hard

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:15.440 
take it off could be a little bit hard
here<00:03:05.760> as<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.090> see

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.870 

so<00:03:16.050> I'm<00:03:16.110> not<00:03:16.230> very<00:03:16.380> sure<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.770> best<00:03:17.040> way<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.370> put

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
so I'm not very sure the best way to put

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.910 
so I'm not very sure the best way to put
put<00:03:18.150> put<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.860> these<00:03:20.040> off<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.440> suppose<00:03:22.440> which

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
put put one of these off I suppose which

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.090 
put put one of these off I suppose which
is<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:24.930> want<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.200> start<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.770> one<00:03:25.830> of

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
is that you do want to start on one of

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:42.179 
is that you do want to start on one of
the<00:03:26.190> sides

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.530 

Barbara<00:03:43.189> hard-to-remove<00:03:43.670> at<00:03:43.969> least<00:03:44.150> for<00:03:44.329> me

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
Barbara hard-to-remove at least for me

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:53.190 
Barbara hard-to-remove at least for me
and<00:03:44.870> let's<00:03:45.620> try<00:03:45.829> out<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:46.099> Autobahn<00:03:46.579> over<00:03:46.819> here

exactly<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.479> same<00:04:29.810> here<00:04:30.639> it<00:04:31.639> just<00:04:31.729> maybe<00:04:32.030> a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
exactly the same here it just maybe a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.029 
exactly the same here it just maybe a
little<00:04:32.389> bit<00:04:32.570> when<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.870> take<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.259> off<00:04:33.410> maybe

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
little bit when you take it off maybe

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.860 
little bit when you take it off maybe

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
just maybe it's just me that hasn't

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.830 
just maybe it's just me that hasn't
found<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.320> good<00:04:36.470> way<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.770> put<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.310> off<00:04:37.780> but<00:04:38.780> I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
found a good way to put it off but I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.540 
found a good way to put it off but I
could<00:04:38.990> also<00:04:39.139> be<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.349> good<00:04:39.560> thing<00:04:39.830> if<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.370> want

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
could also be a good thing if you want

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.870 
could also be a good thing if you want
to<00:04:40.639> have<00:04:40.789> a<00:04:40.820> very<00:04:41.539> good<00:04:42.229> one<00:04:42.470> that<00:04:43.099> is<00:04:43.370> hard<00:04:43.729> to

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
to have a very good one that is hard to

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.999 
to have a very good one that is hard to
remove<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:47.840> case<00:04:48.229> that<00:04:48.409> will<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.710> stay

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
remove and a case that will you stay

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.939 
remove and a case that will you stay
there<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.430> then<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.750> course<00:04:51.080> we<00:04:51.710> have<00:04:51.919> a

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
there and then of course we have a

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.820 
there and then of course we have a
screen<00:04:52.280> protector<00:04:52.310> over<00:04:52.820> here<00:04:53.500> that<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:54.590> can

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
screen protector over here that we can

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.990
