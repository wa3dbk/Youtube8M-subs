about<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.700> could<00:00:35.820> probably<00:00:35.940> buy<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
about that we could probably buy a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
about that we could probably buy a
different<00:00:36.510> car<00:00:36.780> later<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.320> let's<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:37.950> play

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
different car later but let's just play

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.450 
different car later but let's just play
it<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> HUD<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.989> mixed<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> see

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it on the HUD is like mixed you can see

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299 
it on the HUD is like mixed you can see
it's<00:00:41.579> kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.790> floating<00:00:42.980> that's<00:00:43.980> PI<00:00:44.129> not

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it's kind of floating that's PI not

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's kind of floating that's PI not
supposed<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.610> we've<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:44.820> rear<00:00:45.090> view

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
supposed to be we've got rear view

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.580 
supposed to be we've got rear view
mirror<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.750> good<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> could

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
mirror looks really good like you could

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
mirror looks really good like you could
probably<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> side

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
probably actually use that and the side

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
probably actually use that and the side
gears<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:50.039> than<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> um<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
gears as well other than that um in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
gears as well other than that um in
other<00:00:52.170> than<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> fact<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.860> head<00:00:53.100> goes

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
other than the fact that my head goes

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
other than the fact that my head goes
through<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> seat<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.840> scale<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
through the seat the scale here is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.090 
through the seat the scale here is
awesome

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
awesome

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
awesome
maybe<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:57.289> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.039> steering<00:00:59.370> wheel<00:00:59.399> or

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
maybe that I think my steering wheel or

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
maybe that I think my steering wheel or
the<00:00:59.789> in-game<00:01:00.449> wheel<00:01:00.899> spins<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.559> bit

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the in-game wheel spins a little bit

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
the in-game wheel spins a little bit
faster<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.570> a

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
speaking in the pin line I lost 30

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.429 
speaking in the pin line I lost 30
seconds<00:03:54.030> from<00:03:54.120> speaking<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.569> family<00:03:54.900> like

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
seconds from speaking in the family like

that<00:03:56.749> yeah<00:03:57.749> apparently<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.349> game<00:03:58.499> is

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
that yeah apparently this game is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.750 
that yeah apparently this game is
actually<00:03:58.920> really<00:03:59.430> cool<00:03:59.639> with<00:03:59.879> drifting

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
actually really cool with drifting

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.910 
actually really cool with drifting
simulation<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:02.999> put<00:04:03.359> me<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.629> great<00:04:03.930> race

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
simulation and put me just great race

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.399 
simulation and put me just great race
driving<00:04:05.400> simulation<00:04:06.329> in<00:04:06.420> general<00:04:06.810> oh<00:04:06.989> that's

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
driving simulation in general oh that's

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.899 
driving simulation in general oh that's
awesome<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.829> again<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.609> guys<00:04:08.760> are

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I'm using this is the logitech g27 and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.539 
I'm using this is the logitech g27 and
it's<00:04:16.440> actually<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.160> might<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.430> look

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
like it but there's actually the wheel

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.820 
like it but there's actually the wheel
spins<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.239> there's<00:04:21.930> actually<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> wheel

spins like there's actually the wheel

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.909 
spins like there's actually the wheel
moves<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.430> has<00:04:24.199> coming<00:04:25.199> in<00:04:25.259> I<00:04:25.440> don't<00:04:25.740> want<00:04:25.860> to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
moves it has coming in I don't want to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.080 
moves it has coming in I don't want to
say<00:04:25.979> friction<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.849> know<00:04:26.910> what<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
say friction but I don't know what the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.870 
say friction but I don't know what the
word<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.360> but<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.979> steer<00:04:29.370> really<00:04:29.639> hard

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
word is but like if I steer really hard

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.580 
word is but like if I steer really hard
you<00:04:30.180> feel<00:04:30.419> like<00:04:30.660> you're<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:31.229> know<00:04:31.320> fighting

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
you feel like you're you know fighting

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.499 
you feel like you're you know fighting
against<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.039> pavement<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> certain<00:04:33.240> extent

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
against the pavement to a certain extent

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.600 
against the pavement to a certain extent
it's<00:04:33.630> really<00:04:33.900> cool<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.410> adds<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.680> lot<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.889> it

communities that play online online I

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.810 
communities that play online online I
research<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.540> their<00:05:11.290> actual<00:05:11.740> life<00:05:11.980> for<00:05:12.760> the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
research in their actual life for the

love to the NASCAR drivers in real life

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.270 
love to the NASCAR drivers in real life
that<00:05:19.210> are<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:19.450> soon<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.170> be<00:05:20.290> real<00:05:20.530> drivers<00:05:21.040> I

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
that are like soon to be real drivers I

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.440 
that are like soon to be real drivers I
don't<00:05:21.490> know<00:05:21.550> what<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:21.790> is<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:22.000> don't<00:05:22.240> know<00:05:22.390> if

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
don't know what that is I don't know if

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.520 
yeah these IRS committees are actually
like<00:05:36.910> they're<00:05:37.240> actually<00:05:37.690> awesome<00:05:38.050> like<00:05:38.350> I'm

like they're actually awesome like I'm
not<00:05:38.680> really<00:05:38.830> into<00:05:39.130> driving<00:05:39.550> so<00:05:39.850> it's<00:05:40.030> not<00:05:40.180> for

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
not really into driving so it's not for
