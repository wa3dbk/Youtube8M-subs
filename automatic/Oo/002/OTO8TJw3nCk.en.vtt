00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.250
 you get in a new video and it 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.500
 is right with a lot of bang going on that 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.760
 is good 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.439
 What is not supposed to be because it is 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.450
 is about a jumping kassel underneath it goes 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.660
 not so much a ball and who does not 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.390
 knows the heard beaten 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:44.390
 What's up with me today? 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:47.030
 is specks laboratory that we do have the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.390
 is going on so you can find it in the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.760
 karli the forest in a small 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:58.149
 einbuchtungen as you can see here 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.649
 and it is the best in my opinion 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.100
 jumping kassel what i have seen so far 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.210
 optically, at least if you look at that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.119
 Once, please bring it to my heart's content 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.190
 just looks absolutely cool with 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.200
 draw this light 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.390
 that came in up there I was as 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.670
 language and so on and how to get here 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 it just does not look like it is usual 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.290
 shopping basel but you press on 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.390
 buttons on switch and then 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.070
 appears buttons on the man 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.350
 then have to jump around and after a 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.540
 some time again to leave the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.600
 It is said that there is still time 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.460
 a factor that makes the whole thing difficult 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
 that means you have to do it more or 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.600
 learn less by heart at least the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.680
 direction in the next platform 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.450
 turns up and that is 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.480
 on the one hand very cool 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 on the other hand, very difficult though 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.060
 luckily it is so if you do 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 just fall into the lava and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.560
 dies from one of a robot golem 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.300
 something is written 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.250
 the one question is addressed 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500
 teleported back to the main entrance 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.520
 should not have to go all means you 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.560
 Go back again and as soon as you go 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.120
 a station so a kind more 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 button discovered on the way 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 you turn this free you can 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.110
 teleport back to there it is 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 like in these others in the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.100
 with trek or magica province or how 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.300
 that's always there over the clouds 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.300
 it 's pretty much the same 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.650
 this is also the same robot and am 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.750
 Of course, there is a reward in the end 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 Stour again with a lot of shit 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 inside you but do not need the be 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.540
 We then enjoy seeing it like that 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.690
 will look and there are, of course 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.760
 a success for it and like the and battle 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.510
 We'll look around the chest 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 see it soon 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 I am amazed that I get this far 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.150
 in a take I do not have it yet 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.220
 once cut who my videos 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.570
 often he looks maybe noted that the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.100
 cut are meanwhile and I am very 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.930
 I am not astonished yet 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.920
 I need to cut cut otherwise I want 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 I feel sick and start 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.900
 to spit everything and that is not 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.020
 so delicious at the next place 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:22.239
 not now comes the nasty did it 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.680
 fly through and off so laser meteors 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.970
 the area to meet the one 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.450
 slow down and make the damage 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.790
 Whole thing drop but I am 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:41.400
 never been hit by one so well 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 they are not that hard and so right 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.459
 so serious that jumping basel is 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.080
 if you play it relatively long first 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.730
 but once you have completed it 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.980
 this is actually only by if 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.600
 So you also learn what 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.530
 you dare in later life 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.140
 I doubt it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.569
 but you learn and can do it 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.700
 after that I at least at another 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.680
 later try to solve easier 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.600
 and here I was missing because 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.400
 it's clear if such a thing just like that 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.380
 diagonally there is what shall you do with it 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.000
 and in truth you have to 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.180
 this root is on the left wall 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.370
 hangs these ladies who hoops the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.240
 one sees there where the plant whether to 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.979
 the wall so exactly about it running relative 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.140
 quick that I am here now, of course 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.580
 I can not do it because I'm perfect 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.760
 haphazardly through the area 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.610
 I'm still on the first day and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.039
 well, as stupid as I am that I am 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.600
 I take my hero for this root 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.180
 definitely will not disappear yet 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.350
 then I have to go up there and up there 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.970
 of course I can not because the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.020
 platform that leads me there already 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.810
 long gone 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.400
 that's been going on for a long time already 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.169
 means suicidal and again 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 yes, I'm actually from these 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.720
 been hit because I'm stupid 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.160
 on the other hand hardly stood back so once and 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.020
 then we make the buttons again 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.490
 Now the whole thing a little faster 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:15.660
 with a little more taste and then 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.550
 we get there, the platform what is 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.039
 I do not know but happened 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.229
 theoretically it works like that then 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.340
 We are there, the rest is actually 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:28.470
 only pill-pill the man can ask 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.350
 this robot was just in demand 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.270
 and when we are there we are at this 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.430
 place and behind this wall behind it 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.460
 This transparent band was the one 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.800
 maybe already knows the chest and 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.900
 how do you get dressed ? 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.669
 Of course I do not have it and back there 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.210
 is a button and there you have this 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:58.560
 activated the following happens 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.889
 Here I come from vacation 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.880
 back to the lab and what awaits me 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.770
 adventurer so suddenly everything is from 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.250
 readers pierce all the golems 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.289
 but apparently it coincides when you do 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.449
 because alone gets late and accurate time 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.970
 It's like I'm 11 then 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.349
 that is pretty challenging though 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.349
 you are not prepared for it 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.979
 but you actually get it and 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.750
 if you have defeated all golems then 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.409
 Stand there as everyone digs 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.860
 there again 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:40.190
 and this non-passable wall 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:44.230
 disappears that is once the girls 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:53.090
 we have it remains determined 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:54.620
 it can only get to the hours 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.290
 point where you actually defeated her 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.680
 Just say goodbye then 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:04.490
 again and then the far away and you 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:10.430
 can this fantastic chest and yourself 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:12.400
 the fantastic music I idols to 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.689
 nothing now 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.900
 This is 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:22.419
 Rubbish good that was already that 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.979
 jumping pass I am still very much 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.389
 I'm still amazed at the first one 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.580
 I'm not sure if I'll be there tomorrow 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:30.009
 snatching it around to learn the zürcher 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.449
 but so far so good 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.449
 Until next time
