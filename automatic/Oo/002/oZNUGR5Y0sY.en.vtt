00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
tips in terms of garden tips there's a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
tips in terms of garden tips there's a
few<00:00:10.110> here<00:00:10.550> we're<00:00:11.550> always<00:00:11.670> trying<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> block

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
few here we're always trying to block

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.700 
few here we're always trying to block
out<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.420> neighbors<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.990> there's<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> usually

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
out the neighbors and there's a usually

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
out the neighbors and there's a usually
a<00:00:13.740> limit<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.160> how<00:00:14.219> high<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.940> build<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.269> wall

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a limit on how high you can build a wall

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.710 
a limit on how high you can build a wall
in<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.260> case<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> slump<00:00:17.039> stone<00:00:17.279> wall

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
in this case we have a slump stone wall

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.200 
in this case we have a slump stone wall
that<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.840> built<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> max<00:00:20.939> height<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that we built this is the max height we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.060 
that we built this is the max height we
could<00:00:21.359> go<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> did<00:00:22.560> allow<00:00:22.650> us<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> put<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
could go to but it did allow us to put a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310 
could go to but it did allow us to put a
trellis<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.359> allowed<00:00:24.600> us<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> also<00:00:25.199> grow

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
trellis on that allowed us to also grow

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.779 
trellis on that allowed us to also grow
some<00:00:25.560> vines<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.250> allow<00:00:26.400> us<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> block

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
some vines this will allow us to block

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.920 
some vines this will allow us to block
out<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> neighbors<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.510> more<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.810> add<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
out the neighbors a bit more and add a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
out the neighbors a bit more and add a
different<00:00:28.199> texture<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> garden

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
different texture to the garden

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
different texture to the garden
personally<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> love<00:00:30.720> green<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.800> that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
personally I love green I think that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979 
personally I love green I think that
people<00:00:32.489> often<00:00:32.700> look<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.180> flowers<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
people often look for flowers to be the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.389 
people often look for flowers to be the
one<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> only<00:00:34.590> ways<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.040> add<00:00:35.130> color

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
one of the only ways you can add color

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.490 
one of the only ways you can add color
to<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.610> garden<00:00:35.820> without<00:00:36.360> looking<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.930> how<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to a garden without looking at how you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
to a garden without looking at how you
might<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.710> able<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.950> use<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> leaves<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
might be able to use the leaves and the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
might be able to use the leaves and the
textures<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.040> plantings<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.250> create<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> much

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
textures of plantings to create a much

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
textures of plantings to create a much
more<00:00:41.969> interesting<00:00:42.239> effect<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> look

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
more interesting effect if you look

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
more interesting effect if you look
through<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.579> green<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.360> there's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
through out here it's green but there's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.369 
through out here it's green but there's
yellow<00:00:46.170> green<00:00:46.410> chartreuse<00:00:47.000> grey<00:00:48.000> greens<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
yellow green chartreuse grey greens and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.690 
yellow green chartreuse grey greens and
it<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:49.590> works<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:49.950> well<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> blue

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it also works really well with a blue

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
it also works really well with a blue
color<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> pool<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.590> tannish<00:00:53.100> yellow

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
color of the pool and the tannish yellow

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
color of the walls one of the things we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.319 
color of the walls one of the things we
did<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.190> redesigned<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.969> area

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
did here when we redesigned this area

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
did here when we redesigned this area
was<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.260> limit<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.219> amount<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> different

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
was to limit the amount of different

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
was to limit the amount of different
types<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> materials<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.989> were<00:01:01.050> using<00:01:01.320> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
types of materials that we were using we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 
types of materials that we were using we
had<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> wood<00:01:02.640> wall<00:01:03.019> some<00:01:04.019> stucco<00:01:04.350> walls<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
had a wood wall some stucco walls and we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920 
had a wood wall some stucco walls and we
also<00:01:05.250> had<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.790> slump<00:01:06.150> stone<00:01:06.390> wall<00:01:06.689> right

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
also had this slump stone wall right

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
also had this slump stone wall right
here<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.280> decided<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
here and what we decided to do this is a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
here and what we decided to do this is a
wood<00:01:09.630> wall<00:01:09.840> originally<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.380> took<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
wood wall originally we took it out and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
wood wall originally we took it out and
we<00:01:11.159> tried<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> match<00:01:11.790> everything<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.020> had<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we tried to match everything so we had a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
we tried to match everything so we had a
more<00:01:13.380> uniform<00:01:13.860> shape<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> design<00:01:14.580> running

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
more uniform shape and design running

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
more uniform shape and design running
throughout<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.960> whole<00:01:16.110> project<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.830> lot<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
