 if there was a mike ross like that hop 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.690

 lacrosse tekken anyway these 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 infiltrations then who won them 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 the luff who is perhaps about to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.629
 qualify for the grand finale for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 win this kind in Belgium brush

 broom kunter been the grounding and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 hype and bmp kunter she wanted to fuck a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 seen how well they master very very 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 well all the offsets and every time 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 all the costs to say but lag 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.040
 will even touch before buying savines 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.060
 selling the dash creating reflex that is this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 that you want to face that there's no 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.159
 other things were clearly going on 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.619
 this lady beyond that maybe the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 taste some energy infiltrations 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.439
 who finds a mug with double dash 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.909
 before with dale shopper to run away 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.320
 obviously from the descent of the foot a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.430
 care and san roque she who puts back 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 I do not know how he will get out of it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.890
 permanent it's going to be complicated and in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.729
 europe osce in the station the family of 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.630
 two blocks but a ferry we take when 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.310
 even on his vertical jump 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 the opportunity to come back that touches a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 ultra netbook a beaten being traced for 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.770
 that it stays at a distance and that makes 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 debate means foot because the average low 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 who will never get his share is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 good it is beautiful text of two boxers 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.610
 that's why the very cautious to like 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.049
 it shop and people said alps is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 that's inevitable with each and matt 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 checkmate be our be it the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.670
 way to avoid brown belt punch is 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.530
 at half coach effect when the one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 here comes the album peace that were there for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.500
 welcome him 1-0 for infiltration who 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.000
 blew they are concentrated like all 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 both well I turn in punch 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.560
 or the evening hadoken infiltrations that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.619
 still moves back from match entry if 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.030
 the same in the first game had played a 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.579
 canceled enough defensive opening 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.469
 rather than trying to rhj is 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.180
 directly he rather expects to see that 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.890
 that's going on and try to take advantage of 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.970
 errors of two balrog pairs on it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.920
 for example try to put sabine 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 almost all the time on tearing apart 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 that's why he if he cashed pastis 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.239
 Article 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.560
 a whole symbol after that of madam 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.970
 peas and directly after 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 borrowing is to tilt too much 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.000
 with words of marc shop Double Dash 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.500
 weapons and to submit crosoft who stumbles 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 on being white series permanent that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 the intelligence of releasing them 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.299
 always ahead five axes to buy at 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.159
 eventually swallow it's too early along 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.569
 harry cover that much too late 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.010
 no chestnut no low medium hat he 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.870
 is smart use the right moves 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.879
 a dark infiltrate to not get done 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 to dry with dachau parents wifi a babe 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.250
 a small point there was no shock not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.329
 in the middle of all that he was not far 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.700
 because of a small point ended in 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.090
 the guard anyway of two rogge 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.560
 here and there he gets caught all of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.670
 even always late energy here is a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.599
 little point but loses he missed 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.819
 respect twice in a row it's two 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.440
 times too much ex dragon who will not kill 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.709
 but which largely give the advantage 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.540
 dance to his words that's it yes but the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.849
 point where he says to fear palau fear 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.720
 palau he was wrong manipulating the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.579
 pair balrog with this sdf water coming 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.930
 far too far first set for 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.760
 infiltration in any case a quality that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.780
 are at the big end at the end of this set 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.980
 it's about how fast things are 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.540
 because lasseter autumn in pocket 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.159
 at home with each test stroke academos 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.510
 shock had never done it of escoto who 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.980
 we missed the success of your 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.389
 mug again well avoided by 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.680
 Oberbronn luggage was not made 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.730
 twice by the same evil game is a 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 big dots full in color and 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.220
 with the former lawyer again 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.359
 that so far been watched how yves 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.769
 German if he goes ahead but the group has 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.269
 been there to collect on this damon 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.079
 not very simple it is a woodcock and 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.340
 leaving in a pocket 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.450
 again we do not lose ballan who 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.889
 always ahead and to submit big 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.849
 implication new meal ring here 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.139
 why it's still very very 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.519
 tense of fermat big dots on the 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.470
 jumps of much less used stage 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.120
 medium kick and the TV port quality that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.530
 gives me crunch a site in europe and 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.750
 boots with what's called a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.959
 tarpaulin each in France and those who 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.870
 could have had the merit of giving 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.120
 Roman ideas again with the chopper 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.370
 very very badly 10 and loris went over 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.459
 work I can not it's in the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.150
 range and it's punished or at the 2nd cat 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.690
 assumes acquired and here again 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.890
 the match ball for 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.810
 infiltration a great qualification 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.770
 final at the end of that match and you 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320
 believe he's risking is past 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.120
 that gmp infiltration like no messing around 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.110
 what's there when it's the 100 low medium 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.280
 rolls with his dockers know 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.390
 double touch again especially in 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.739
 push mode with its new lines of 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.820
 big tatsumaki points what makes 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.290
 recipe again with words tomorrow 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.820
 customs tariff and amendments for 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.890
 break the words on call back purchase and 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.270
 or the possible savignac dash two 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.410
 pair balrog on laury this exo 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.880
 people still takes looked at takes 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.780
 when even the light with ultra that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.690
 is not used right now it's 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:37.280
 quite smartly citroen and +10 to 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.340
 the screen they are hunted down and 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.630
 the zero says to the absolute josy talhouarn 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.350
 in which case probably the shot and 7 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.870
 passes and each and morning again and 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.830
 this animation the last shot of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.850
 the ultra who is on our doorstep who will kill 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.669
 here father morocco and send him to the loser 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.950
 but this reflex he had space and 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.750
 the ultra in the TV port it was 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.190
 so well played so well played 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.500
 thought that with the corner they were going 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.360
 catch up and unfortunately the latter 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.550
 of kiwi fine filtration who knew it 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.370
 already and is in the process of my opinion of town 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.370
 and the ultra as a goret already knew this 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.160
 that was going to happen at the end of this 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.400
 game and has made no infiltration 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.680
 lost it seems to me lesser I even 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.720
 not if he lost for the moment the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:33.710
 least round against his opponents he 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:37.310
 unfolds everything that happens happening to him 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.930
 the top seed of lion's westerns 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.840
 the ryan hart 1 team be told in 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.000
 passing who is in the train is good of 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.669
 to make a total raid on the entirety 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.740
 of the evo and it's still not without 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.510
 deserves in my opinion that he get there 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.510
 infiltration in the grand finale of this 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.780
 tournament and we will see the right to 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.630
 final loser bracket between 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.730
 and although they have remained alive 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.760
 yasha white who will face umehara 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.810
 dargaud and make sure to have to human bomb 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.070
 who will probably face pr prom 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.290
 rock it goes on like that in human 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.700
 bomb will go face gamer by forgiveness and 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:21.020
 well that will be able on the results of 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.389
 these matches when morning case there is that 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.020
 losers bracket all the people who 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.120
 will lose 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.980
 from there will be eliminated from 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.760
 forgive me will be eliminated from this 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.430
 tournament and it's true that it's going to be 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.060
 still pretty quite complicated enough to 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.130
 manage 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.830
 in any case for the moment all those who 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.720
 remain are already top 6 of this tournament there 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.430
 are the six best of the 1500 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.600
 participants and the best six not that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.980
 it's false not really saying the 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.710
 six best audiences anyway 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.550
 those who have been on this tournament 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.260
 the most successful ones and those 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.620
 who stayed alive during this 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.560
 tournament 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.690
 what you have to know is that it is very very 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.760
 clear the champion of the evo the one who 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.070
 win the calves it's not the best 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.410
 player of the world can not be sacred 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.590
 the best player in the world on a 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.020
 tournament with so many people date a 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.080
 format like that it would still be a 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.259
 tournament of two types 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.629
 of type how two types roland garros 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:25.960
 where you twists and that the 120 best of 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:27.490
 world who will be qualified and they 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.289
 all compete with a lot 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.539
 a lot of this law in challenges 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.590
 in paintings aligned his live there 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.409
 obviously it would be the best of 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.810
 world would be sacred but that's it 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.639
 far enough still very far 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.080
 unfortunately to be the case 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.400
 unfortunately Thursday for the tournament 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.050
 because maybe there are efforts to 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.789
 do and both on the organization to 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.740
 both about the formats of all this 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.759
 but hey the fact is that for the moment 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.889
 I do not see who can test 

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:53.289
 infiltrations on street fighter iv 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.789
 current so maybe this eventually 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.349
 will still be the best in the world 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:57.539
 it's the filtration happens to go 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:00.340
 until the end 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:03.219
 who will prevail one finds oneself in 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:06.400
 very little time for the final part 

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:09.610
 Part 5 of this case dedicated to the evo 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:13.889
 with the destitution and the conqueror of this 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.889
 evo 2012 at the end of the cast
