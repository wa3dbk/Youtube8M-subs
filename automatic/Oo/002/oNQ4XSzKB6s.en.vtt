00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
on the plans I know it's been a while

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.970 
on the plans I know it's been a while
but<00:00:08.360> between<00:00:09.360> being<00:00:09.690> sick<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.290> they're<00:00:10.830> not

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.160 
but between being sick and they're not
being<00:00:11.219> significant<00:00:12.150> changes<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> beginning

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
being significant changes the beginning

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.959 
being significant changes the beginning
I<00:00:13.320> figured<00:00:13.710> let<00:00:13.920> me<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.280> give<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> few

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
weeks you could see a difference but of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.900 
weeks you could see a difference but of
course<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.130> everything<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.609> starting<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
course now everything is starting to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.439

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is the storm pod rose plant this one

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.490 
is the storm pod rose plant this one
over<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.830> died<00:00:25.830> away<00:00:27.199> we'll<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.470> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
over here died away we'll see if we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
over here died away we'll see if we
could<00:00:28.680> save<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.039> once<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.400> separate<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> cuz

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
could save that once we separate it cuz

container is empty now my gloves in it
and<00:03:13.310> apparently<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.819> was<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:16.549> good<00:03:17.549> condition

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and apparently it was a good condition

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
and apparently it was a good condition
for<00:03:18.260> composting<00:03:19.260> because<00:03:19.620> when<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:19.889> dug

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
for composting because when I dug

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.099 
for composting because when I dug
through<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.790> whole<00:03:20.970> thing<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.569> potato<00:03:21.900> was

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
through the whole thing the potato was

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.559 
through the whole thing the potato was
gone<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:23.819> don't<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.299> why<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
gone so I don't know if that's why the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.759 
gone so I don't know if that's why the
potato<00:03:24.959> plant<00:03:25.139> died<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:27.139> right<00:03:28.139> now<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> dirt

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
potato plant died but right now the dirt

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.460 
potato plant died but right now the dirt
is<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.790> container<00:03:30.150> just<00:03:30.450> being<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.410> be

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is in a container just being to be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.979 
is in a container just being to be
composted<00:03:32.090> here's<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.209> other<00:03:33.389> house<00:03:33.600> plant

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
composted here's my other house plant

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.670 
composted here's my other house plant
which<00:03:34.400> if<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.940> see<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.389> little

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
which if you can see the little

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.069 
which if you can see the little
hols<00:03:39.689> that's<00:03:40.689> because<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.620> catsuit<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.310> I

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
hols that's because the catsuit on it I

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.179 
hols that's because the catsuit on it I
figured<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.230> was<00:03:44.319> better<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> chew<00:03:44.920> on<00:03:45.069> this

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
figured it was better to chew on this

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.589 
figured it was better to chew on this
plant<00:03:45.519> than<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.849> poinsettia<00:03:46.269> which<00:03:46.480> is

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
plant than the poinsettia which is

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.500 
plant than the poinsettia which is
poisonous<00:03:47.019> so
