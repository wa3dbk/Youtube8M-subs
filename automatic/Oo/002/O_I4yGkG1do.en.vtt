00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.400
 then hi girls then in this 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.990
 video I'll show you the coverage 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.940
 of the natural nail 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.540
 I performed the film King first 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.950
 and how I begin with the preparation 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.750
 of the nail then we have already animated 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.270
 we have already done everything so I start with 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.490
 the anti fungal me in this case that i 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.059
 I'm using bushel products from the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.790
 decimals the anti-escape I pass over it all 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.790
 the nail and also below the free village 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:51.320
 then I put in life rap and this too 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:56.809
 I put on the whole nail and then I go core 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.890
 primer the primer is put only 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.890
 on natural india 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.220
 let's wait on the face with dinho 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 ok then now start with the base 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 blue always by guzman mastella 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.220
 carefully over the entire nail and standing 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.140
 be careful not to touch the film 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 I put very little product if I take it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'm going to eliminate it too 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:45.810
 manner and lamp in minutes ok one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:50.550
 after 3 basic minutes have gone by 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.390
 take the camber I take with the brush 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.409
 necessary amount based said 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 I'm going to work 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.720
 the opposition makes the central part 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 let's say a little more moved towards the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.549
 freeboard and then go down to the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.600
 cuticle with very little product I do 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:18.329
 in lateral lightly and then I go e 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.030
 on the other side it starts from the center 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:28.500
 of the cuticle I go to the other side 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.590
 and then discharge the genius at the tip and if there is 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.170
 excessive product I'm going to remove 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.329
 regarding the lateral structure like 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
 you see already positioned right not always 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.590
 it is immediately perfect and if it does not come 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 perfect I go a little closer to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.019
 arrange with the brush 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 looking at her in all the years 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:56.260
 angles then from the front to the edge 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.430
 free laterally that good or bad is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.250
 already in place also on the other side because 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.989
 sometimes there are its roofs 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.060
 so let's go and recover 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.340
 in lamp for another three minutes and now me 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.159
 I forgot to tell you that for the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.920
 curved used the former ie slow of 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.420
 bushman and I wanted to say that I am not 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.450
 absolutely good at speaking English 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.379
 so in quotation marks I speak it as it is 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.870
 I read 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:30.700
 excuse my ignorance they take away state 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:36.579
 of dispersion with the clan and begins 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.909
 at sea side free edge e 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:47.169
 parallel in parallel must be 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:49.209
 lateral and parallel linear and then 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.540
 it begins in the sea around the lap like that 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.540
 there 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.230
 I try to fix the camber in the 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.730
 best possible way to go 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.730
 to the sea sheet as little as possible 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.419
 once I file the structure 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.990
 indeed he looks at it in all angles 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:40.889
 so if I go on free board 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:44.940
 lateral and then also from the other side 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.940
 to see if it is correct 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.990
 too touched the cuticle 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.449
 once i've done this i do 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.370
 turn your hand to nothing about it 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.729
 he raised the edge correctly 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.729
 free 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.729
 after that step the mustache 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.230
 and then always use this accessory or 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.230
 remove the dust 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.370
 now I make a monocolor and I'm using 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.370
 the color is a color of the chamaleon e 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.069
 dell exclusive and magic glitter 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.810
 magic blues 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.580
 then I put myself to put the color 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.240
 a bit of time because I like it 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.280
 spread it as perfect as possible use 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.220
 a cat's tongue brush so 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:53.770
 that is rounded on its own tip 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:59.300
 put it in the best way 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:04.240
 it starts from the cuticle frost and then I go up 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.240
 laterally to reach the tip 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.310
 same procedure on the other side 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.540
 and then the system freeboard also that 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.540
 color 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.840
 needed some side protection lo 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.840
 I take off 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.160
 then put the lamp on now I do the 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.410
 second hand still in color though 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.990
 as you see a very beautiful color is that 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.710
 it might even be feasible to do 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.110
 just one hand but me for all the colors 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.990
 face always remains because it goes by 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:56.960
 fix the imperfections that I have braked 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.150
 in the first one by hand the resolution is in 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.800
 lamp once again past minutes 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.220
 of color lamp I go with the 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:10.099
 sealant spreads perfectly over 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:14.570
 all the color well in the laterals e 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:16.849
 in the tip and still the lamp states 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.979
 minutes of lamp I used a gel 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.199
 without dispersion and therefore it is not there 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:24.849
 need to degrease and go directly 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:27.169
 with cuticle oil one step away from 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.710
 all parts 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.710
 around him 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.600
 and like this here the final result 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.600
 what you see it well 

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.590
 thanks to the next hello
