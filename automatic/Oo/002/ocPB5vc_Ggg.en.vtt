 yeah the rest is hermann is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.890
 maybe maybe it's worth it I know 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.360
 not maybe 2000 credit I do not know 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.979
 I'm afraid to say a big bullshit 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.119
 ok it's not on the market of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.190
 transfers good it's okay I'm going 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.810
 send it in case 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.820
 here on the pile of transfers 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.229
 but because we know we never know 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 will try to scrounge credits by 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.920
 here and there 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.330
 go the third pack to 35,000 credit 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.710
 down for the moment the packs to 50000 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.050
 relayed we will leave them on this account 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 warm and we will not open them 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.490
 the second step when the third 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.860
 pack forgiveness fernando torres fernando 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.630
 torres again yeah again 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.360
 once we have a chance and it's not the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.820
 good descartes form I say yes lacazette 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 I say yes but my blue legs not 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.360
 blue card no boost and I tell you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.560
 and it's still incredible or there 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.480
 but credit I did not like what happened 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.130
 past he was turning to 0 happened to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.709
 7 million to 6 million and a few 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.720
 aisles we left the fourth pack to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.130
 35 miles at least a little boost was going 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.620
 even a little buzz I would be happy 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.650
 frankly I would be happy to casillas 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 it's a good pack it's a good pack 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.280
 fabregas and casillas it remains a good 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.209
 pack after how I know it's worth 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.010
 nothing is going to be able to go 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.120
 see that on the market of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.370
 transfers still have not so 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.830
 mercier fabregas it's the same I think 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.930
 that prices have dropped a little bit 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.760
 in any case we will keep it at 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.930
 club not bump it was not too much 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.250
 badly after that's true I do not know 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.290
 exactly price level what that 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.060
 give but here is compared to others 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.739
 we could have been caught but 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
 I do not like it's this bug these 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.820
 credits that lives that come back to zero and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.410
 that go back to the initial value that's me 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.890
 a little bit scary go last 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 pack to 35000 and we will pick up 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.170
 go go go go go we want 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.709
 something blue at the end this time 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.889
 there my first boost finally finally my 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.750
 first boost on was 15 ha good 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.040
 ccc one of the most farting I think of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.630
 team team of the week to yes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.489
 it's the keeper who shoots a head that's 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.139
 pretty weird but it's okay it's 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.329
 a boost is a boost here now 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.950
 I can say I got a boost even though this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.430
 bandit 1000 credits I do not care I had 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.739
 a boost so here after the rest the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.230
 rest we do not care everything kept at the club 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.180
 and that we're going to sell go go more 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.530
 we had a booster another good step 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.480
 we're going to open the packs anyway 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.590
 50000 just because it's you here 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.239
 just because you're going 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.410
 open these two packs to 50 miles and 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.209
 you will see that I did well because 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.780
 that in this pack we will grab manual 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:52.639
 neuer admire benatia for the armament he 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.959
 was expensive finally he was proud yeah I 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.790
 do not know he was maybe fifteen 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.250
 thousand there then they must 2000 credit to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.079
 break everything is even using nothing that I 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.630
 keep it will be strictly nothing I 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.459
 keeps on sale or directly and we 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.239
 will open this last pack at 50000 I 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.900
 put the joystick 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.889
 destiny is directly traced is this 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.870
 we're going to get some blue in this pack 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.920
 marcelo but fucking but marcelo march and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.870
 to Marseille 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.190
 could have pushed in the head 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.419
 if it would have been quite good of any 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.500
 way I would not get him because 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.180
 of course it would have been a map 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.430
 blue had been less in the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.810
 packs but that's marcelo is good we're going 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.400
 say we'll say it's pretty good 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.380
 for for this patch is not at all 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.880
 how much is worth in all cases 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.770
 a little barbeau on top of that a little 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 Chinese serge there is very good player 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.970
 in this in this pack unfortunately I 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.830
 do not think we'll be reimbursed so 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.330
 that's okay listening and once again a 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.800
 video in a video that got a little 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.810
 that's it, that's it, yes, luck starts 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.060
 start to arrive we had we had a 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.919
 boost we had marcelo we got in trouble 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.850
 cesc fabregas we had casillas so 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.860
 here we have been players 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.330
 rather interesting even it's true 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.710
 is absolutely not reimbursed by 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.780
 compared to everything we have precisely 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.310
 spent in this video in every 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.530
 case as I wanted said lachance happens 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.000
 luck will soon point the end of 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.620
 his nose the ultimate chance I want to 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.389
 say with with a blue card in all 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.800
 the cases it's not for this video it's 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.630
 not for this pack opening I hope in 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.370
 all the cases anyway that it will have you 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.270
 more and then I tell you to the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.270
 next on everyone
