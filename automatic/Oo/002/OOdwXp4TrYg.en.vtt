if<00:02:08.720> season<00:02:09.319> one<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.830> ps3<00:02:10.310> league<00:02:10.520> earth<00:02:10.850> 12

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
if season one of the ps3 league earth 12

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.080 
if season one of the ps3 league earth 12
a<00:02:11.690> 13<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:12.230> really<00:02:12.620> popular<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.220> thinking

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
a 13 is really popular and thinking

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.400 
a 13 is really popular and thinking
about<00:02:14.150> maybe<00:02:14.480> doing<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.990> Jeep

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
about maybe doing a Jeep

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.320 
about maybe doing a Jeep
two<00:02:15.650> league<00:02:15.920> or<00:02:16.310> f1<00:02:17.180> 2013<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:18.230> ps3<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.820> think

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
two league or f1 2013 on ps3 but I think

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.730 
two league or f1 2013 on ps3 but I think
if<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.600> had<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.810> do<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> GP<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.410> Lee<00:02:21.560> God

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
if I had to do a GP to Lee God

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.400 
if I had to do a GP to Lee God
definitely<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.640> myself<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.930> maybe

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
definitely have to do it myself or maybe

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.220 
definitely have to do it myself or maybe
