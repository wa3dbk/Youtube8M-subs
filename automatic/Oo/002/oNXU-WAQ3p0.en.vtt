that's<00:00:39.480> conditioning<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> bottles<00:00:40.739> at

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that's conditioning in the bottles at

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.090 
that's conditioning in the bottles at
the<00:00:40.949> moment<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:42.149> been<00:00:42.359> in<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.680> at<00:00:43.680> 11

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the moment it's been in there for at 11

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.299 
the moment it's been in there for at 11
days<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.440> either<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.949> bottles

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
days I think now so either the bottles

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
days I think now so either the bottles
of<00:00:47.550> capped<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.420> nicely<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.199> far<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.620> they're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of capped up nicely so far and they're

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.150 
of capped up nicely so far and they're
nice<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:49.949> tight<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.350> might<00:00:52.530> even<00:00:52.649> crack<00:00:52.949> one

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
nice and tight so I might even crack one

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.840 
nice and tight so I might even crack one
next<00:00:53.399> week<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.019> how<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.379> going

what I've gone for I'm doing a half half

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.300 
what I've gone for I'm doing a half half
batch<00:01:53.420> which<00:01:53.869> for<00:01:54.350> me<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.500> about<00:01:54.860> nine<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.100> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
batch which for me is about nine and a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.719 
batch which for me is about nine and a
quarter<00:01:55.490> leaders<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:57.319> one<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.429> things<00:01:58.579> I

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
quarter leaders and one of the things I

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.840 
quarter leaders and one of the things I
found<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.149> if<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.479> use<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> kit<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.729> be

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
found is if I use a kit I have to be

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.859 
found is if I use a kit I have to be
very<00:02:01.880> careful<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.590> bitterness<00:02:04.069> rating

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
very careful that the bitterness rating

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.919 
very careful that the bitterness rating
doesn't<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:06.189> through<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.340> roof<00:02:07.929> because

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
doesn't go through the roof because

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.589 
doesn't go through the roof because
these<00:02:09.110> kids<00:02:09.619> are<00:02:09.799> pretty<00:02:09.950> bitted<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:11.060> 23

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
these kids are pretty bitted for a 23

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.330 
these kids are pretty bitted for a 23
litre<00:02:11.750> batch<00:02:12.049> so<00:02:12.380> when<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> go<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.799> nine<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.250> a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
litre batch so when I go to nine and a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.610 
litre batch so when I go to nine and a
quarter<00:02:13.610> litres<00:02:14.150> I'm<00:02:14.510> effectively<00:02:15.049> over

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
quarter litres I'm effectively over

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.720 
quarter litres I'm effectively over
doubling<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.580> bitterness<00:02:17.330> rating<00:02:18.549> so<00:02:19.549> what<00:02:19.700> I

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
doubling the bitterness rating so what I

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.699 
doubling the bitterness rating so what I
decided<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.299> do<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.930> had<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> look<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
decided to do is I had a look on the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.130 
decided to do is I had a look on the
Coopers<00:02:22.069> website<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.450> found<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
Coopers website and I found that the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.949 
Coopers website and I found that the
strapped<00:02:24.709> kit<00:02:25.390> had<00:02:26.390> one<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> lowest

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
strapped kit had one of the lowest

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.740 
strapped kit had one of the lowest
buttering<00:02:27.829> rates<00:02:28.329> so<00:02:29.329> that's<00:02:29.510> why<00:02:29.690> I've

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
buttering rates so that's why I've

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.009 
buttering rates so that's why I've
chosen<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.799> then<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.730> add<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.690> I'm

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
chosen that and then to add to that I'm

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.590 
chosen that and then to add to that I'm
gonna<00:02:33.260> add<00:02:34.359> 150<00:02:35.359> grams<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.900> crystal<00:02:36.230> malt<00:02:36.709> has

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
gonna add 150 grams of crystal malt has

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.729 
gonna add 150 grams of crystal malt has
50<00:02:38.600> grams<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.190> caracals<00:02:40.390> I'm<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:42.319> going<00:02:42.590> to

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
50 grams of caracals I'm then going to

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.120 
50 grams of caracals I'm then going to
dry<00:02:43.400> hop<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:44.000> some<00:02:44.390> mosaic<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.410> I've<00:02:45.560> got

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
dry hop with some mosaic that I've got

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.710 
dry hop with some mosaic that I've got
left<00:02:46.310> over<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:47.420> I'll<00:02:47.510> probably<00:02:47.750> dry<00:02:48.109> hop<00:02:48.380> for

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
left over so I'll probably dry hop for

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.080 
left over so I'll probably dry hop for
yeah<00:02:50.720> good<00:02:51.109> 5<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.590> 7<00:02:51.859> days<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.489> last<00:02:52.639> 5<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
yeah good 5 to 7 days and the last 5 to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.650 
yeah good 5 to 7 days and the last 5 to
7<00:02:53.359> days<00:02:53.389> of<00:02:53.690> fermentation<00:02:55.209> yes<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:56.540> that's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
7 days of fermentation yes so that's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.150

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
caracals and the crystal malt at the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.470 
caracals and the crystal malt at the
moment<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.400> yeah<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:10.700> that's<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.299> beer

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
draft into the fermenter I've topped it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.610 
draft into the fermenter I've topped it
up<00:03:19.459> with<00:03:19.840> some<00:03:20.840> cold<00:03:21.290> water<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.420> I've<00:03:23.620> poured

grain bag just to make sure the grain

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.710 
grain bag just to make sure the grain
bits<00:03:35.690> don't<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:36.079> into<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.470> liquid<00:03:37.479> so<00:03:38.479> yeah

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
that's my octa-core Coopers Mo's a draft

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.730 
that's my octa-core Coopers Mo's a draft
although<00:04:10.250> it's<00:04:10.760> going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.060> be<00:04:11.380> quite<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> strong

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
although it's going to be quite a strong

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.819 
although it's going to be quite a strong
beer<00:04:12.980> came<00:04:13.340> out<00:04:13.550> at<00:04:15.220> 10:58<00:04:17.620> original<00:04:18.620> gravity

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
beer came out at 10:58 original gravity

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.450 
beer came out at 10:58 original gravity
so<00:04:19.310> it's<00:04:19.459> going<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.669> be<00:04:20.290> in<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.620> mid<00:04:21.769> 6s<00:04:22.280> I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
so it's going to be in the mid 6s I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.100 
so it's going to be in the mid 6s I
guess<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:23.110> alcohol<00:04:24.160> content<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.660> yeah<00:04:26.840> it's

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
guess for alcohol content so yeah it's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.340 
guess for alcohol content so yeah it's
just<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.470> simple<00:04:28.100> simple<00:04:28.790> beer<00:04:29.320> something<00:04:30.320> I
