00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.970 
comparison next I'll run a three pass
render<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:10.090> show<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.479> effect<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.049> quality

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
render to show the effect on quality

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.880 
render to show the effect on quality
each<00:02:12.700> render<00:02:12.970> has<00:02:13.180> 256<00:02:13.959> anti-aliasing

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
each render has 256 anti-aliasing

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.550 
each render has 256 anti-aliasing
samples<00:02:15.310> by<00:02:15.910> using<00:02:16.090> three<00:02:16.420> frame<00:02:16.690> passes<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
samples by using three frame passes the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440 
samples by using three frame passes the
anti-aliasing<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.520> depth<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.819> field<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.300> now

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
anti-aliasing for depth of field is now

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.510 
anti-aliasing for depth of field is now
equivalent<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.989> three<00:02:20.319> times<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.890> of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
equivalent to three times that of

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.490 
equivalent to three times that of
a single<00:02:21.910> pass<00:02:22.060> render<00:02:22.480> because<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.080> passes

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
a single pass render because the passes

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.580 
a single pass render because the passes
continue<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.040> contribute<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.090> overall

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
continue to contribute to the overall

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.810 
continue to contribute to the overall
anti-aliasing<00:02:26.590> level<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.190> depth<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.610> field

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
anti-aliasing level for depth of field

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.800 
anti-aliasing level for depth of field
so<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:31.390> pass<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.790> three<00:02:33.790> passes<00:02:34.240> see<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
so one pass and three passes see the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.130 
so one pass and three passes see the
difference<00:02:36.360> anti<00:02:37.360> aliasing<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:37.780> now<00:02:37.990> be

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
difference anti aliasing can now be

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.350 
difference anti aliasing can now be
enabled<00:02:38.380> or<00:02:38.770> disabled<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.550> given<00:02:39.880> render

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
enabled or disabled for a given render

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360 
enabled or disabled for a given render
output<00:02:40.570> this<00:02:41.530> alpha<00:02:41.890> output<00:02:42.220> has

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
output this alpha output has

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.760 
output this alpha output has
anti-aliasing<00:02:42.970> enabled<00:02:43.420> while<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.560> one

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
anti-aliasing enabled while this one

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.640 
anti-aliasing enabled while this one
does<00:02:45.220> not

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.709
