00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
amount that you get free from it was a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.919 
amount that you get free from it was a
cat<00:01:54.470> again<00:01:54.679> right<00:01:55.220> from<00:01:55.369> traxxas<00:01:55.819> I<00:01:56.299> added<00:01:56.899> a

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
cat again right from traxxas I added a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.029 
cat again right from traxxas I added a
lot<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.079> problem<00:01:57.380> without<00:01:57.560> getting<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:57.860> lot<00:01:58.009> of

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
lot of problem without getting a lot of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.249 
lot of problem without getting a lot of
mud<00:01:58.399> dirt<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> lot<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.630> crap<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.049> really

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
mud dirt and a lot of crap it I really

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.679 
mud dirt and a lot of crap it I really
don't<00:02:00.409> want<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.740> there<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.880> my<00:02:02.030> servo<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
don't want in there on my servo in the

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.679 
don't want in there on my servo in the
truck<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.799> actually<00:02:04.009> build<00:02:04.340> myself<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:05.060> gerd

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
truck so I actually build myself a gerd

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.809 
truck so I actually build myself a gerd
okay<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.710> actually<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> guard<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.759> I

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
okay this is actually a guard that I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.609 
okay this is actually a guard that I
built<00:02:07.969> myself<00:02:08.090> probably<00:02:09.049> asking<00:02:09.319> me<00:02:09.440> where

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
built myself probably asking me where

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.640 
built myself probably asking me where
did<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.830> get<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.190> from<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.690> fish<00:02:11.690> tank<00:02:11.959> all

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
did I get this from a fish tank all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.550 
did I get this from a fish tank all
right<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:14.000> are<00:02:14.120> out<00:02:14.180> bashing<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.959> basically

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
right we are out bashing and basically

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.500 
right we are out bashing and basically
bashes<00:02:16.069> make<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.549> most<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:17.000> what<00:02:17.209> they<00:02:17.269> have

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
bashes make the most of what they have

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.589 
bashes make the most of what they have
and<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.930> couldn't<00:02:18.170> find<00:02:18.290> anything<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.650> day<00:02:19.599> of

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
and I couldn't find anything that day of

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.660 
and I couldn't find anything that day of
yeah<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:21.980> pretty<00:02:22.069> much<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.400> really

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
yeah this is pretty much all I really

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.430 
yeah this is pretty much all I really
heads<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.090> actually<00:02:23.569> used<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
heads this actually used to be just a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.170 
heads this actually used to be just a
flat<00:02:24.769> piece<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.160> plastic<00:02:25.549> okay<00:02:25.819> like<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.120> said

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
flat piece of plastic okay like I said

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.900 
flat piece of plastic okay like I said
you<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.569> get<00:02:26.810> anything<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.380> do<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.790> is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
you can get anything to do this this is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.420 
you can get anything to do this this is
like<00:02:29.060> two<00:02:29.209> millimeters<00:02:29.690> thick<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:31.250> what<00:02:31.400> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
like two millimeters thick so and what I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.650 
like two millimeters thick so and what I
did<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.819> took<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:32.090> math<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.540> just

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
did is I took a math and it's just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.360 
did is I took a math and it's just
matches<00:02:33.019> all<00:02:33.170> right<00:02:33.319> we<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:33.950> also<00:02:34.069> use<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
matches all right we can also use a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.400 
matches all right we can also use a
torch<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> very<00:02:35.120> very<00:02:35.329> very<00:02:35.480> low<00:02:36.049> setting

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
torch at a very very very low setting

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.940 
torch at a very very very low setting
and<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:37.130> heat<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.400> very<00:02:37.849> very<00:02:38.620> barely<00:02:39.620> barely

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
and just heat it very very barely barely

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.259 
and just heat it very very barely barely
heated<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.489> enough<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> plastics

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
heated just enough to the plastics

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.900 
heated just enough to the plastics
pliable<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.980> heat<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.160> up<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.549> then

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
pliable and just heat it up and then

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.610 
pliable and just heat it up and then
just<00:02:44.090> bend<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.049> recommend<00:02:45.350> for

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
just bend it so but what I recommend for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.470 
just bend it so but what I recommend for
doing<00:02:45.859> for<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.400> you're<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.420> to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
doing for that is you're just going to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
doing for that is you're just going to
want<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.870> put<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.560> down<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.739> your<00:02:48.889> table

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
want to put it down on your table

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.610 
want to put it down on your table
there's<00:02:49.790> something<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.239> area<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.870> use

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
there's something like this area and use

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.840 
there's something like this area and use
want<00:02:51.799> with<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> piece<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.280> piece<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.579> plastic

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
want with a piece of piece of plastic

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.340 
want with a piece of piece of plastic
like<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.569> bend<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.930> great<00:02:54.109> down

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
like this and you can bend a great down

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.289 
like this and you can bend a great down
and<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.069> perfect<00:02:55.280> 90-degree<00:02:55.700> angle

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
and you get a perfect 90-degree angle

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.390 
and you get a perfect 90-degree angle
just<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.560> very<00:02:57.739> very<00:02:58.040> easy<00:02:58.100> to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
just like that so it's very very easy to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.550 
just like that so it's very very easy to
do<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.760> all<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.480> had<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.750> do<00:02:59.930> right<00:03:00.109> after<00:03:00.230> that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
do and all I had to do right after that

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.340 
do and all I had to do right after that
to<00:03:00.829> install<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.180> had<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.569> put<00:03:02.989> two

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
to install it was I just had to put two

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.280 
to install it was I just had to put two
little<00:03:03.709> holes<00:03:03.970> right<00:03:04.970> here<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:06.079> put<00:03:06.200> these

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
little holes right here I just put these

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.420 
little holes right here I just put these
two<00:03:06.410> little<00:03:06.530> holes<00:03:06.709> or<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.069> can<00:03:07.160> put<00:03:07.250> one

two little holes or you can put one

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.670 
two little holes or you can put one
there<00:03:07.459> one<00:03:07.819> here<00:03:08.060> whatever<00:03:08.239> works<00:03:08.569> my<00:03:09.350> servo

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
there one here whatever works my servo

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.930 
there one here whatever works my servo
had<00:03:09.889> was<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.220> bit<00:03:10.340> weird<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.819> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
had was a little bit weird and have the

had was a little bit weird and have the
size<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.269> screws<00:03:11.569> i<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:11.870> put<00:03:11.989> two<00:03:12.139> little

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
size of screws i just put two little

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.009 
size of screws i just put two little
small<00:03:12.590> holes<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.100> my<00:03:13.880> servo<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.870> slides

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
small holes and my servo just slides

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.150 
small holes and my servo just slides
right<00:03:15.109> on<00:03:15.230> here<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.620> see<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.769> rub<00:03:15.980> marks

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
right on here you can see the rub marks

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.280 
right on here you can see the rub marks
my<00:03:16.459> servo<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.600> slides<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:18.019> on

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
my servo and it just slides right on

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.080 
my servo and it just slides right on
there<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.829> garth<00:03:19.130> my<00:03:19.250> entire<00:03:19.430> servo<00:03:19.850> i'm

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
there and garth my entire servo i'm

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.940 
there and garth my entire servo i'm
writing<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.420> flying<00:03:20.810> debris<00:03:20.989> like<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.560> it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
writing a flying debris like that it

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.740 
writing a flying debris like that it
doesn't<00:03:22.010> touch<00:03:22.340> my<00:03:22.370> linkages<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.450> great

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
doesn't touch my linkages it's great

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.720 
doesn't touch my linkages it's great
really<00:03:24.290> nice<00:03:24.560> guard<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.099> works<00:03:25.280> flawlessly

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
really nice guard and works flawlessly

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.280 
really nice guard and works flawlessly
and<00:03:25.970> I've<00:03:26.060> never<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.389> problem<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.109> and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
and I've never a problem with it and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.530 
and I've never a problem with it and
stuff<00:03:28.250> we<00:03:28.370> had<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.609> lot<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.760> water<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.329> stuff

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
stuff we had a lot of water and stuff

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.120 
stuff we had a lot of water and stuff
splashing<00:03:30.019> out<00:03:30.139> in<00:03:30.230> there<00:03:30.349> when<00:03:30.470> i<00:03:30.530> go<00:03:30.680> bashing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
splashing out in there when i go bashing

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.589 
splashing out in there when i go bashing
you'll<00:03:31.280> see<00:03:31.430> tons<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.819> water<00:03:31.970> marks<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.389> this

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
you'll see tons of water marks on this

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.080 
you'll see tons of water marks on this
and<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.870> servos<00:03:33.440> not<00:03:33.590> even<00:03:33.769> touched<00:03:34.090> but

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
and the servos not even touched but

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.240 
and the servos not even touched but
overall<00:03:35.329> works<00:03:36.290> really<00:03:36.410> really<00:03:36.500> well<00:03:36.680> that's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
overall works really really well that's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.860 
overall works really really well that's
about<00:03:37.430> what<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.730> looks<00:03:37.849> like<00:03:38.030> with<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.660> tracks

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
about what it looks like with the tracks

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.520 
about what it looks like with the tracks
of<00:03:39.019> servos<00:03:39.519> as<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.760> can<00:03:40.880> see<00:03:41.290> turn<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> truck

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
of servos as you can see turn the truck

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.050 
of servos as you can see turn the truck
up<00:03:42.709> on<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.889> side

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
up on the side

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.390 
up on the side
alright<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.080> definitely<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> lot<00:03:45.800> more<00:03:45.860> exposed

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
alright so definitely a lot more exposed

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.940 
alright so definitely a lot more exposed
than<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.360> old<00:03:47.510> cereal<00:03:47.900> boxes<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.500> lot<00:03:48.890> of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
than the the old cereal boxes a lot of

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.050 
than the the old cereal boxes a lot of
smaller<00:03:49.190> though<00:03:49.400> does<00:03:49.610> she<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.880> lot<00:03:50.030> of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
smaller though does she have a lot of

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.640 
smaller though does she have a lot of
space<00:03:50.330> in<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.510> truck<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.989> lot<00:03:51.140> easier<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.440> do

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
space in the truck a lot easier to do

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.830 
space in the truck a lot easier to do
and<00:03:51.890> even<00:03:52.700> because<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.360> was<00:03:53.599> able<00:03:53.690> to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and even because of that I was able to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.479 
and even because of that I was able to
build<00:03:54.110> myself<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.590> mount<00:03:54.770> for<00:03:54.860> my<00:03:54.950> plate<00:03:55.220> I

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
build myself a mount for my plate I

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.660 
build myself a mount for my plate I
actually<00:03:56.030> took<00:03:56.270> right<00:03:56.780> here<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.050> linkage<00:03:57.670> from

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
actually took right here a linkage from

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.940 
actually took right here a linkage from
the<00:03:58.940> from<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.360> revo<00:03:59.630> again<00:04:00.410> i<00:04:00.440> preheated<00:04:00.890> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
the from the revo again i preheated the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.520 
the from the revo again i preheated the
metal<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.280> little<00:04:01.489> bit<00:04:01.640> bent<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.530> just

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
metal a little bit bent it up and just

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.839 
metal a little bit bent it up and just
let<00:04:03.739> my<00:04:03.800> pipe<00:04:04.010> right<00:04:04.190> on<00:04:04.310> there<00:04:04.489> cuz<00:04:04.670> i've<00:04:04.730> got

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
let my pipe right on there cuz i've got

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.000 
let my pipe right on there cuz i've got
my<00:04:04.970> JP<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.390> be<00:04:05.480> on<00:04:05.599> there<00:04:05.750> now<00:04:05.870> which<00:04:06.500> runs

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010
