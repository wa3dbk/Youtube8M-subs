00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.689

 we currently have an extremely large number of inquiries 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.869

 Of course the practice is one 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.869
 essential part of the training at the 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.549

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.729

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.650

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.060
 like while preparing sushi while on 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.940

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.470

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.210
 only hot here 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.090
 and we want the young people today 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.530
 Just show what tourism is all about 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.570
 everything is possible like many 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150
 different opportunities and possibilities 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.890
 if you have this industry one 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.420
 Education is because our people 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.530
 are very much in demand worldwide 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 and it's not just about that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.650
 professional training but also 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.020
 in this typical Styrian charm 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.700
 and this occur and the special 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.910
 what our students put on the way 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.880
 too international and multi-layered the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.850
 Tourism is so universal 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.910
 also training several languages 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.930
 are as natural as 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.630
 perfect appearance 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.150
 the graduates are the doors to the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.830
 open all over the world 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.980
 On the other hand , it looks like students too 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.500
 over 20 nations to the top school in 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 Bad same mountain so that's something else 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
 just because I'm from Munich that it 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.690
 his school lives in munich 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.430
 There is not really the combination 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.440
 between school and education that it 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.940
 very valuable to me is very important 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.160
 for me that it is in the next to very 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.420
 interesting and the tourists already 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.220
 at the same market simply offer only 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.570
 super dollar top education so me 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.300
 I have many friends at school 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.220
 were the work in tourism is not 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.860
 always easy and often very 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.780
 exhausting 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.080
 the more people are shining 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.420
 Enthusiasm for this profession that feels 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.490
 I also think that training is 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.240
 very extensive and very international 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 and I would like later in the 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.810
 travel world and also somewhere in the world 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.820
 work away and that we too 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.770
 very well taught how to do that on 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.990
 best does that for the students 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.090
 already during the training always 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.000

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.550
 this also on the day of the open door 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.320
 the olympic games in sochi will be the one 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.620
 Show again in school 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.080
 can that in Styria tourism 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.709
