00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
change the radius off that board so what

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.900 
change the radius off that board so what
he<00:04:04.150> did<00:04:04.420> was<00:04:04.930> he<00:04:05.380> installed<00:04:05.770> big<00:04:06.220> tall<00:04:06.550> frets

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
and he radius the fence and what that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.580 
and he radius the fence and what that
does<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.569> outer<00:04:10.750> strings<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.290> feels

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
does is on the outer strings it feels

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.100 
does is on the outer strings it feels
almost<00:04:11.860> scalloped<00:04:12.610> because<00:04:13.270> of<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.840> space

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
almost scalloped because of the space

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.800 
almost scalloped because of the space
between<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.770> string<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.640> fretboard<00:04:16.600> wood

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
between the string and a fretboard wood

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.080 
between the string and a fretboard wood
but<00:04:17.650> towards<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.040> middle<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.579> feels<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.970> little

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
but towards the middle it feels a little

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.670 
but towards the middle it feels a little
flat<00:04:19.480> it<00:04:19.989> feels<00:04:20.200> great

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
flat it feels great

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.030 
flat it feels great
I<00:04:20.709> like<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.400> now<00:04:22.320> going<00:04:23.320> back<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> tremolo

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
I like it now going back to the tremolo

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.030 
I like it now going back to the tremolo

this<00:04:27.280> guitar<00:04:27.720> with<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> bridge<00:04:29.169> flush

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
whammy bar because one primarily it was

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.969 
whammy bar because one primarily it was
a<00:04:36.910> backup<00:04:37.570> guitar<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:38.229> if<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.440> broke<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.710> string

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
a backup guitar so if I broke a string

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.000 
and if i broke the string on this guitar
i<00:04:46.600> didn't<00:04:47.229> have<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.530> worry<00:04:47.740> about<00:04:47.770> the

counteract that more with the straighten
