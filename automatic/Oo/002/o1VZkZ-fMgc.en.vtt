them credit but we I don't know I I
don't<00:02:20.920> think<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.489> start<00:02:21.790> trying<00:02:22.269> to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
don't think we can start trying to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.949 
don't think we can start trying to
dissect<00:02:22.719> it<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.409> just<00:02:23.439> have<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.569> find<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.780> way<00:02:25.810> to

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
dissect it we just have to find a way to

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.610 
dissect it we just have to find a way to
continue<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.680> close<00:02:26.890> out<00:02:27.129> games<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:29.470> we

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
continue and close out games when we

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
continue and close out games when we
close<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.129> some<00:02:30.340> games<00:02:30.579> we've<00:02:30.819> got<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.090> try<00:02:31.329> to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
close out some games we've got to try to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.179 
close out some games we've got to try to
rely<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.260> build<00:02:32.409> on<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.099> a

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
rely on that and build on that it's a

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.839 
rely on that and build on that it's a
long<00:02:33.459> year<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:34.329> got<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> point<00:02:34.720> I'm<00:02:35.849> I'm

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
long year we got a point I'm I'm

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.780 
long year we got a point I'm I'm
ecstatic<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.750> got<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> point<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:38.200> picked<00:02:38.439> up

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
ecstatic we got a point we picked up

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.580 
ecstatic we got a point we picked up
some<00:02:39.840> confidence<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:41.019> some<00:02:41.200> things<00:02:41.409> that

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
some confidence with some things that

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.610 
some confidence with some things that
we're<00:02:41.709> doing<00:02:41.889> within<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.700> game<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:44.439> so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
we're doing within the game and so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.720 
we're doing within the game and so
that's<00:02:44.769> how<00:02:44.889> we're<00:02:45.069> going<00:02:45.189> to<00:02:45.250> approach<00:02:45.370> this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
that's how we're going to approach this

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.970 
that's how we're going to approach this
as<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:46.150> get<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.659> our<00:02:46.689> next<00:02:46.780> day<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.200> work<00:02:47.349> this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
as we get to our next day of work this

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.339 
as we get to our next day of work this
seem<00:02:48.220> fragile<00:02:48.639> right<00:02:49.030> now<00:02:49.090> sure<00:02:49.629> does<00:02:49.840> yeah

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
seem fragile right now sure does yeah

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.649 
seem fragile right now sure does yeah
yeah<00:02:51.129> but<00:02:51.280> that's<00:02:51.459> part<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.879> that's<00:02:52.419> part

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
yeah but that's part of it that's part

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.379 
yeah but that's part of it that's part
of<00:02:52.720> growing<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:53.139> a<00:02:53.169> team<00:02:53.790> teams<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:55.030> through<00:02:55.060> it

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
of growing as a team teams go through it

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.479 
of growing as a team teams go through it
i'm<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.629> sure<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:57.010> go<00:02:57.159> through<00:02:57.370> this

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
i'm not sure if you you go through this

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.159 
i'm not sure if you you go through this
stuff<00:02:57.730> here<00:02:58.030> especially<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.659> way<00:02:58.780> tonight

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169 
stuff here especially the way tonight

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.339 
stuff here especially the way tonight
went<00:02:59.439> i<00:02:59.889> don't<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.489> many<00:03:00.549> teams<00:03:00.879> do<00:03:01.349> but

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
went i don't think many teams do but

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.659 
went i don't think many teams do but
that's<00:03:02.560> what's<00:03:02.829> honest<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:05.069> yeah<00:03:06.069> i<00:03:06.129> think

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.669 
that's what's honest and yeah i think

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.809 
that's what's honest and yeah i think
it's<00:03:07.030> fragile<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.889> think<00:03:08.889> all<00:03:09.040> teams<00:03:09.400> get<00:03:09.700> in

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
it's fragile I think all teams get in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.339 
it's fragile I think all teams get in
this<00:03:09.939> state<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.480> how<00:03:10.629> quickly<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.109> can<00:03:11.200> get

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
this state it's how quickly you can get

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.050 
this state it's how quickly you can get
out<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.709> that's<00:03:12.129> the<00:03:12.370> important<00:03:12.879> thing<00:03:12.909> for

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
out of it that's the important thing for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.089 
out of it that's the important thing for
our<00:03:13.239> club<00:03:13.540> right<00:03:13.810> now<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.229> how<00:03:14.409> to<00:03:14.440> change<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
our club right now is how to change the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.430 
our club right now is how to change the
momentum<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.790> thought<00:03:16.389> we<00:03:16.569> changed<00:03:16.959> momentum

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
momentum I thought we changed momentum

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.009 
momentum I thought we changed momentum
within<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.799> game<00:03:17.979> tonight<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.750> could<00:03:19.930> have

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
within the game tonight it could have

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.539 
within the game tonight it could have
gone<00:03:20.139> either<00:03:20.290> way<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.829> when<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.400> two

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
gone either way there when it's two

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.270 
gone either way there when it's two
nothing<00:03:22.139> Eddie<00:03:23.139> makes<00:03:23.379> a<00:03:23.470> couple<00:03:23.799> big<00:03:23.919> saves

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
nothing Eddie makes a couple big saves

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.740 
nothing Eddie makes a couple big saves
and<00:03:24.609> then<00:03:24.729> I<00:03:24.819> thought<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.239> changed<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and then I thought we changed the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.960 
and then I thought we changed the
momentum<00:03:26.019> within<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.769> game<00:03:26.949> well<00:03:27.699> we<00:03:27.790> didn't

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
momentum within the game well we didn't

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.689 
momentum within the game well we didn't
finish<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.319> have<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.620> continue<00:03:29.949> to

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
finish it so we have to continue to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.490 
finish it so we have to continue to
concentrate<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.359> those<00:03:31.510> parts<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.079> game

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
concentrate in those parts of the game

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.009 
concentrate in those parts of the game
and<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.849> try<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> build<00:03:34.269> off<00:03:34.479> it<00:03:36.810> Eddie<00:03:37.810> made

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and and try to build off it Eddie made

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.170 
and and try to build off it Eddie made
some<00:03:38.199> big<00:03:38.319> saves<00:03:38.530> for<00:03:38.919> us<00:03:39.010> yeah<00:03:39.370> he<00:03:39.639> especially

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
some big saves for us yeah he especially

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.490 
some big saves for us yeah he especially
one<00:03:40.419> was<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.690> nothing<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:43.720> they<00:03:44.199> had<00:03:44.319> some

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
one was to nothing it they had some

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.110 
one was to nothing it they had some
couple<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.159> really<00:03:45.310> good<00:03:45.430> chances<00:03:45.849> could<00:03:46.030> have

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
couple of really good chances could have

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.059 
couple of really good chances could have
got<00:03:46.209> out<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.449> hand<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.290> thought<00:03:47.799> he<00:03:47.919> made

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
got out of hand so I thought he made

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.300 
got out of hand so I thought he made
some<00:03:48.099> big<00:03:48.400> saves<00:03:48.639> at<00:03:48.879> key<00:03:49.030> times<00:03:49.060> then<00:03:52.379> ok<00:03:53.379> ok

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
some big saves at key times then ok ok

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.309 
some big saves at key times then ok ok
he<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.239> ok<00:03:55.389> we<00:03:55.750> still<00:03:57.900> still<00:03:58.900> need<00:03:59.049> more

Tommy's<00:04:08.840> played<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.290> way<00:04:10.090> cast<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:11.420> a

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
Tommy's played that way cast that's a

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.459 
Tommy's played that way cast that's a
part<00:04:11.749> of<00:04:11.810> his<00:04:11.930> game<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.290> he's<00:04:12.409> improved<00:04:12.799> at<00:04:12.980> I

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
part of his game that he's improved at I

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.140 
part of his game that he's improved at I
think<00:04:15.469> we<00:04:15.650> need<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.459> what<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.820> know<00:04:16.910> we

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
think we need that what you know we

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.520 
think we need that what you know we
can't<00:04:17.359> we<00:04:17.479> have<00:04:17.509> st.<00:04:17.750> Louis<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.139> coming<00:04:18.410> in

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
can't we have st. Louis is coming in

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.740 
can't we have st. Louis is coming in
here<00:04:18.680> our<00:04:18.799> next<00:04:19.039> game<00:04:19.299> we're<00:04:20.299> going<00:04:20.449> to<00:04:20.570> need

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
here our next game we're going to need

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.159 
here our next game we're going to need
that<00:04:20.930> against<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.500> type<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.769> team<00:04:22.810> Cass<00:04:23.810> is

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
that against that type of team Cass is

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.290 
that against that type of team Cass is
beginning<00:04:25.009> to<00:04:25.220> get<00:04:25.340> consistent<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.120> think

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
beginning to get consistent and I think

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.860 
beginning to get consistent and I think
he's<00:04:26.449> finding<00:04:26.840> his<00:04:27.020> game<00:04:27.289> through<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.870> but

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
he's finding his game through that but

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.390 
he's finding his game through that but
you<00:04:29.990> know<00:04:30.080> that's<00:04:30.380> part<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:31.210> us<00:04:33.070> growing<00:04:34.070> as<00:04:34.370> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
you know that's part of us growing as a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.710 
you know that's part of us growing as a
team<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.789> needs<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.090> come<00:04:35.210> from<00:04:35.270> more<00:04:35.539> people

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
team it needs to come from more people

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.330 
team it needs to come from more people
and<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:37.520> hasn't<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.210> late<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.990> again<00:04:39.919> it's<00:04:40.070> not

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
and it hasn't of late and again it's not

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.129 
and it hasn't of late and again it's not
about<00:04:40.639> running<00:04:41.030> people<00:04:41.240> through<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.630> wall<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
about running people through the wall it

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.050 
about running people through the wall it
just<00:04:42.349> built<00:04:42.620> about<00:04:43.070> being<00:04:43.400> hard<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:43.880> play

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
just built about being hard to play

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180 
just built about being hard to play
against<00:04:44.479> we<00:04:45.139> still<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.710> lot<00:04:46.160> of

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
against we still have a lot of

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.589 
against we still have a lot of
improvement<00:04:46.789> in<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:46.970> part<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.300> game<00:04:47.479> and

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
improvement in that part of the game and

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.740 
improvement in that part of the game and
I<00:04:47.900> thought<00:04:48.139> tonight<00:04:49.090> we<00:04:50.090> got<00:04:50.270> some<00:04:50.300> more<00:04:50.570> out

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
I thought tonight we got some more out

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.240 
I thought tonight we got some more out
of<00:04:50.780> other<00:04:51.020> people<00:04:51.440> but<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:51.740> certainly<00:04:51.979> are<00:04:52.220> not

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
of other people but we certainly are not

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.270 
of other people but we certainly are not
consistent<00:04:52.699> enough<00:04:52.880> with<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:57.099> seemed<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.190> be

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
consistent enough with that seemed to be

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.400 
consistent enough with that seemed to be
completely<00:04:58.669> different<00:04:59.090> player<00:04:59.410> he's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
completely different player he's

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.020 
completely different player he's
improving<00:05:00.830> he's<00:05:01.310> probably<00:05:01.580> one<00:05:01.789> of<00:05:01.820> our<00:05:01.940> most

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
improving he's probably one of our most

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.300 
improving he's probably one of our most
improved<00:05:02.570> players<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:03.199> year<00:05:03.259> from<00:05:03.800> from<00:05:04.220> the

improved players this year from from the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.790 
improved players this year from from the
start<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.639> year<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.970> now<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.530> didn't<00:05:06.530> see

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.260 
start of the year to now I didn't see
the<00:05:06.919> penalty<00:05:07.310> I'm<00:05:07.520> not<00:05:07.789> sure<00:05:07.970> what<00:05:08.120> happened

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
the penalty I'm not sure what happened

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.270 
the penalty I'm not sure what happened
