been doing this wrathion quest line and
I'm<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.210> point<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> nearly

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I'm actually at the point where I nearly

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.569 
I'm actually at the point where I nearly
have<00:01:32.070> my<00:01:34.640> 600<00:01:35.640> item<00:01:36.030> level<00:01:36.210> cloak<00:01:36.659> which<00:01:37.650> while

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
have my 600 item level cloak which while

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
have my 600 item level cloak which while
it's<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> big<00:01:39.570> PvP<00:01:40.500> upgrade

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's not going to be a big PvP upgrade

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's not going to be a big PvP upgrade
at<00:01:41.100> least<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> traditional<00:01:42.329> sense<00:01:42.390> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
at least in the traditional sense it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.039 
at least in the traditional sense it's
certainly<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> aid<00:01:44.759> world<00:01:45.240> pvp<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
certainly going to aid world pvp in

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
certainly going to aid world pvp in
duels<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> whatnot<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.180> know

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
duels and whatnot because as you know

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.929 
duels and whatnot because as you know
that<00:01:48.630> pv<00:01:49.549> pvp<00:01:50.600> 496<00:01:51.600> item<00:01:52.560> level<00:01:52.740> cap<00:01:53.130> doesn't

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that pv pvp 496 item level cap doesn't

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
that pv pvp 496 item level cap doesn't
apply<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.630> duels<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:56.329> world<00:01:57.329> pvp<00:01:57.869> because

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
apply in duels and world pvp because

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.380 
apply in duels and world pvp because
it's<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.520> instanced<00:02:00.240> PvP<00:02:01.110> zone<00:02:01.159> so

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
it's not like an instanced PvP zone so

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's not like an instanced PvP zone so
that's<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.600> nothing<00:02:03.810> new<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.479> cloak<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that's like nothing new but the cloak is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.150 
that's like nothing new but the cloak is
so<00:02:08.929> basically<00:02:09.929> I've<00:02:10.170> been<00:02:10.470> working<00:02:10.800> towards

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so basically I've been working towards

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.580 
so basically I've been working towards
game<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> beasting<00:02:12.060> cloak<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.410> all
