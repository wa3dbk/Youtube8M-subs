00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 on air projects bogotol today's topic 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.490
 football 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.340
 I unfortunately do not watch football because 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.650
 that i don't have tv football i 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.810
 I look very very rarely I do not have 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.060
 TV before, I often watched 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.400
 football because I played football 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.559
 I used to be actively examined everything 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.629
 matches watched as the Russian premier 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.330
 the league and so because of the english premier league 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.030
 just now there is not much time 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.129
 I used to watch periodically before 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.470
 football when there was some very 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.570
 cool league when was the world championship 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.399
 for example, but then I do n’t know how the city 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 I became interested in it 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.660
 more football play than look at 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.940
 the stadium has been several times its life 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.250
 went to the zenith in live football has never 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.290
 I never watched the stadium 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.870
 what really am ashamed of me 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.180
 confess on TV before watching 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.220
 football is now generally not even watching 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.990
 I basically liked it but I 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.979
 TV liked to watch more than 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.979
 I do not live a fan 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.130
 I have no favorite team my favorite 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
 team well, of course, zenith channel radio 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 I do not watch football. What is your favorite team? 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.610
 except as zenith I can not be where 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.009
 we team was once a favorite player 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.930
 Zinaida did not like playing 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.390
 Cristiano ronaldo even when i'm still in 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 St. Petersburg did not live I am already ill for zenith all 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.040
 I liked real life in madrid 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 Roberto Carlos Raul I loved those who 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.899
 once played dad sleep and striker michael 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 Salgado Protocol to Fernando Hierro 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.259
 require asking for help from us of this kind 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.360
 and in the Russian national team 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.140
 ovchinnikov here it seemed to me too that he 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 wildly cool man i never played 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 football sections but i played cottage cheese 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.630
 football played him quite a lot 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.399
 once even we participated in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.140
 city ​​championship on the yard 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.149
 football 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.729
 there we won I went football 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.310
 section about six months my grades in 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.080
 the school has gone down to incredibly bad 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.780
 level because all my thoughts were 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.759
 exceptionally busy football and nurse 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 I'm told I'm sorry when 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.590
 pull up knowledge of all the lessons 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.480
 then though so please excuse me from 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 me quite violently and football past 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.600
 when we were there 14 15 16 years me even 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.030
 was the first adult soccer I 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.530
 traveled all kuzbass football 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.620
 matches I am the champion of the city 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.200
 Lenin-Kuznetsky 7 to 15 years, I played 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 In childhood teenage teams played 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.610
 very cool truth except no one 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.260
 didn't count just playing all day 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.280
 some time I was fond of yet 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.049
 football freestyle 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.049
 that is, I learned to do all sorts of tricks I 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.290
 far from the player before 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.360
 relationship to the fans really me 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.000
 do not even describe the attitude to the fans 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.830
 it is exactly like how the fans are not in my 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.600
 principle pretty good 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.480
 it's good to root for some team 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.400
 there go with them some chants 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 come up and so on minutes cheering for 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.960
 the command seems to me it is cool and even 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.640
 funny I am against any hooliganism 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.490
 that pass either on the streets or 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.460
 somewhere else I for example can not imagine how 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.920
 possible after the match and after the victory either 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.310
 after losing your favorite team 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.110
 go smash in general everything around but it 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.360
 no longer a fan this is probably all the same 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.820
 nothing else fans just have to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.100
 support the team in general there is no difference 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.660
 won the team and they lost 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.130
 Equal will smash this whole 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.500
 near football not even what prevents 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.870
 Football is not as if he does not help 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.970
 I treat to near-football will be fire and 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
 chairs will fly at all in all 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.900
 parties will be bits and people around 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.010
 childhood I would not want them 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.050
 ruined my shop or my car 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 and probably the most interesting topic 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.860
 actually what are we all here for 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.200
 gathered for what we came up here 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.570
 this topic with football is a natural match 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.220
 in Jow be summoned or against challenge 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.070
 against joe black whatever your me 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.410
 I liked the fact that the match was over 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.410
 at the proper level pretty quickly all 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.990
 tired all no longer any form is fast 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.730
 tired except max serkov magician serkov she 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.830
 our operator john his body is not 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.840
 absolutely all attacks were prepared 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.700
 who went to our gate they passed with 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.220
 success naturally we won in 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.260
 number and due to the fact that we are goalkeeper as 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.090
 football seemed to play less 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.250
 sell or less plays 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.940
 soccer goalkeeper job highlighting not at all 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.400
 knows how to play football even once 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.040
 did not play the guys from the call prepared 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.110
 they have all three players strong i am very 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.300
 cool time rule if there were goalkeepers 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.900
 roughly the same categories then we would 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.760
 chose - 73 and 74 with all due respect to 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.070
 roller and necklace or good technique 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.620
 valka good breathing but we were 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.060
 speed the addition of the groove combination and i 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.130
 I think that we would have won anyway 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.680
 I was wildly interested in playing in one 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.170
 team with Wolke score but obviously not 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.160
 the game and all of these understand just 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.810
 will win 3 by 2 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.430
 but the essence is not the essence of the fact that I 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.930
 enjoyed football and then 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.600
 I still had very strong muscles 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.600
 probably the few 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.520
 it was all the comments that were affected. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.230
 who will root for whom max decided and what 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.360
 he will be rooting for in Jobava teley 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.490
 well and at the same time as if slightly dirty 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.260
 us and I am opposed to joblova 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.030
 accordingly smear them felt 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.860
 some note of such a negative with my 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.140
 parties comment who were in 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.630
 the side of djavob's body and they were not 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.450
 evil namely the goal on directed to 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.430
 to call so let's say bathert with your 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.310
 countries from the viewers and boots with 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.230
 of their countries I have achieved my way 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.230
 it's all good and in the end it will lead to 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.450
 the fact that season 3 will be weak at least 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.140
 not worse than the first and therefore were mine 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.300
 comments 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.540
 just such and precisely towards joe be 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.810
 or I hope for your understanding and 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.210
 important to understanding ilya and valka they 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.640
 just the same and sort of understood me 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.310
 thank you so much for calling 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.430
 they accepted our offer we played 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.710
 really want a revenge and be sure 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.169
 it will be but I hope nobody took it 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.740
 so as i said it was a project chatted 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.740
 until
