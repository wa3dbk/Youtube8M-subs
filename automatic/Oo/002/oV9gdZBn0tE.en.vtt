much<00:01:34.169> time<00:01:34.249> rewatching<00:01:35.249> this<00:01:35.399> segment<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
much time rewatching this segment and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
much time rewatching this segment and
it's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.450> strange<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.319> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it's a bit strange because when you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's a bit strange because when you
think<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.069> this<00:01:38.219> song<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.789> fit

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
think about it this song would have fit

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
think about it this song would have fit
into<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.329> children<00:01:39.929> show<00:01:40.139> but<00:01:40.469> it<00:01:40.560> probably

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
into any children show but it probably

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.169 
into any children show but it probably
would<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.189> been<00:01:41.279> quickly<00:01:41.700> forgotten

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
would have been quickly forgotten

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.089 
would have been quickly forgotten
anywhere<00:01:42.840> else<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.740> part<00:01:43.919> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.069> reason

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
anywhere else I think part of the reason

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.859 
anywhere else I think part of the reason
it<00:01:44.399> worked<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.729> well<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.239> aside<00:01:45.569> from<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
it worked so well here aside from the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
it worked so well here aside from the
overall<00:01:46.319> strength<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.889> show<00:01:47.069> that<00:01:47.279> it's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
overall strength of the show that it's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.519 
overall strength of the show that it's
attached<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.209> that<00:01:48.419> here<00:01:48.749> they<00:01:48.929> really

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.529 
attached to is that here they really

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.139 
attached to is that here they really
went<00:01:49.709> all<00:01:49.919> out<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.489> thing<00:01:50.849> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
went all out for this thing the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.059 
went all out for this thing the
animation<00:01:51.689> alone<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> some<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.560> best<00:01:52.590> in

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
animation alone is some of the best in

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.830 
animation alone is some of the best in
the<00:01:53.099> series<00:01:53.489> I<00:01:53.849> mean<00:01:53.999> just<00:01:54.179> for<00:01:54.299> example

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the series I mean just for example

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.179 
the series I mean just for example
there's<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> part<00:01:55.319> at<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.499> where<00:01:55.770> pinky

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
there's a part at the end where pinky

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.609 
there's a part at the end where pinky
starts<00:01:56.520> spinning<00:01:56.939> around<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.689> flash<00:01:58.319> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
starts spinning around now in flash it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.019 
starts spinning around now in flash it
would<00:01:58.739> have<00:01:58.829> been<00:01:58.919> really<00:01:59.219> easy<00:01:59.609> for<00:01:59.759> them<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
would have been really easy for them to

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:01.909 
would have been really easy for them to
just<00:02:00.149> make<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> character<00:02:01.020> turn<00:02:01.319> in<00:02:01.559> a<00:02:01.649> circle

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
just make the character turn in a circle

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.799 
just make the character turn in a circle
but<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.429> you<00:02:02.520> pay<00:02:02.700> attention<00:02:02.819> you<00:02:03.239> can<00:02:03.509> see

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:03.809 
but if you pay attention you can see

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:05.929 
but if you pay attention you can see
every<00:02:04.229> part<00:02:04.529> of<00:02:04.590> her<00:02:04.770> body<00:02:04.799> moving<00:02:05.639> they're

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
every part of her body moving they're

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.760 
every part of her body moving they're
just<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.329> sorts<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.929> little<00:02:07.109> details<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
just all sorts of little details like

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.589 
just all sorts of little details like
that<00:02:07.859> but<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.280> push<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.880> over<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.420> top

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that but just push this over the top

from<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.959> animation<00:02:10.379> standpoint<00:02:11.159> it<00:02:11.400> also

friendship lesson on that how about

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.779 
friendship lesson on that how about
learning<00:06:30.229> to<00:06:30.439> control<00:06:30.589> your<00:06:30.949> impulses<00:06:31.339> or

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789

requires care attention and
problem-solving<00:06:36.110> and<00:06:36.289> is<00:06:36.529> more<00:06:36.680> complicated

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
problem-solving and is more complicated

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.189 
problem-solving and is more complicated
than<00:06:37.399> just<00:06:37.550> throwing<00:06:37.819> parties<00:06:38.449> and<00:06:38.599> smiling<00:06:39.139> a

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
what if they didn't become friends what

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.170 
what if they didn't become friends what
if<00:06:42.590> the<00:06:42.710> lesson<00:06:43.129> really<00:06:43.490> was<00:06:43.759> that<00:06:43.789> don't

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180

that's a real life lesson that can be
important<00:06:49.909> to<00:06:50.000> learn<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.419> anything<00:06:51.050> would

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 
important to learn to anything would

important to learn to anything would
have<00:06:51.409> been<00:06:51.439> better<00:06:51.560> than<00:06:51.889> just<00:06:52.069> telling<00:06:52.400> us

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
have been better than just telling us

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.920 
have been better than just telling us
what<00:06:52.610> we've<00:06:52.759> already<00:06:52.969> known<00:06:53.330> since<00:06:53.599> the<00:06:53.659> first

full<00:07:29.900> range<00:07:30.050> of<00:07:30.199> emotion<00:07:30.650> from<00:07:30.770> pinky<00:07:31.250> like<00:07:31.580> I

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
full range of emotion from pinky like I

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:33.399 
full range of emotion from pinky like I
said<00:07:31.909> before<00:07:32.029> she<00:07:32.449> does<00:07:32.689> feel<00:07:32.930> bad<00:07:33.199> about

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409 
said before she does feel bad about

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.110 
said before she does feel bad about
messing<00:07:33.860> things<00:07:34.009> up<00:07:34.279> and<00:07:34.490> she<00:07:34.699> is<00:07:34.849> more

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 
messing things up and she is more

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.999 
messing things up and she is more
thoughtful<00:07:35.599> about<00:07:35.719> her<00:07:35.990> actions<00:07:36.500> even<00:07:36.740> if<00:07:36.889> she

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:37.009 
thoughtful about her actions even if she

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:38.769 
thoughtful about her actions even if she
can't<00:07:37.250> control<00:07:37.400> herself<00:07:37.699> most<00:07:38.090> of<00:07:38.210> the<00:07:38.300> time<00:07:38.509> I

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:38.779 
can't control herself most of the time I

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.300 
can't control herself most of the time I
don't<00:07:38.870> really<00:07:39.229> think<00:07:39.379> it<00:07:39.620> was<00:07:39.710> necessary<00:07:40.219> to

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.310 
don't really think it was necessary to

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.010 
don't really think it was necessary to
make<00:07:40.520> her<00:07:40.699> cause<00:07:40.939> all<00:07:41.150> those<00:07:41.300> problems<00:07:41.569> just

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020 
make her cause all those problems just

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.540 
make her cause all those problems just
to<00:07:42.169> get<00:07:42.319> the<00:07:42.439> audience<00:07:42.860> more<00:07:43.009> invested<00:07:43.460> in

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
to get the audience more invested in

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.430 
to get the audience more invested in
cranky<00:07:44.090> but<00:07:44.330> it<00:07:44.449> is<00:07:44.629> an<00:07:44.870> interesting<00:07:45.110> approach

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
cranky but it is an interesting approach

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.619 
cranky but it is an interesting approach
at<00:07:45.860> the<00:07:45.889> very<00:07:46.129> least<00:07:46.370> the<00:07:46.849> one<00:07:47.060> problem<00:07:47.270> that<00:07:47.509> I

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:47.629 
at the very least the one problem that I

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:49.629 
at the very least the one problem that I
absolutely<00:07:48.139> cannot<00:07:48.589> defend<00:07:49.039> though<00:07:49.279> is<00:07:49.490> the

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 
absolutely cannot defend though is the

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.820 
absolutely cannot defend though is the
wasted<00:07:50.120> lesson<00:07:50.509> at<00:07:50.629> the<00:07:50.659> end<00:07:50.930> overall<00:07:51.650> I

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:51.830 
wasted lesson at the end overall I

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.499 
wasted lesson at the end overall I
really<00:07:51.860> enjoyed<00:07:52.490> this<00:07:52.639> episode<00:07:52.819> enough<00:07:53.330> that

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:53.509

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.909 
really enjoyed this episode enough that
I<00:07:53.539> would<00:07:53.839> have<00:07:53.960> liked<00:07:54.199> to<00:07:54.289> give<00:07:54.469> it<00:07:54.589> a<00:07:54.650> nine

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 
I would have liked to give it a nine

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:56.769 
I would have liked to give it a nine
based<00:07:55.279> on<00:07:55.430> its<00:07:55.610> strong<00:07:55.909> points<00:07:55.940> but<00:07:56.509> by<00:07:56.629> making

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:56.779 
based on its strong points but by making

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:02.509 
really weak morale that had very little

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:04.390
