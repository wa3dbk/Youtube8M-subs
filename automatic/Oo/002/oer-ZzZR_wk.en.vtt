piece so we're going with his second
best<00:00:41.300> choice<00:00:41.510> which<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.170> some<00:00:42.980> some<00:00:43.489> copper

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
best choice which is some some copper

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.760 
best choice which is some some copper
spillways<00:00:44.390> or<00:00:44.600> some<00:00:44.750> copper<00:00:45.140> tubes<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.590> bring

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
copper looks really pretty when it gets

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.410 
copper looks really pretty when it gets
a<00:00:48.649> patina<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.280> there<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.730> shows<00:00:49.910> some<00:00:49.969> age

when<00:00:58.940> pennies<00:00:59.300> were<00:00:59.449> really<00:00:59.750> made<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.019> copper

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
when pennies were really made of copper

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.830 
when pennies were really made of copper
and<00:01:00.590> people<00:01:01.370> treated<00:01:01.730> koi<00:01:02.269> ponds<00:01:02.539> as<00:01:02.750> I

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
pennies into their copper levels could

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.780 
pennies into their copper levels could
get<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.500> high<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.520> could<00:01:07.640> be

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
get really high and it could be

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.590 
get really high and it could be
dangerous<00:01:08.600> for<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.290> fish<00:01:10.180> one<00:01:11.180> thing<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.450> want

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
dangerous for the fish one thing I want

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.630 
dangerous for the fish one thing I want
to<00:01:11.659> point<00:01:11.900> out<00:01:12.049> is<00:01:12.290> one<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.159> dangers<00:01:13.490> of

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
to point out is one of the dangers of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.429 
to point out is one of the dangers of
coppers<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.090> you<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.330> soft<00:01:14.659> water<00:01:15.020> or<00:01:15.259> low

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
coppers if you have a soft water or low

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.980 
coppers if you have a soft water or low
pH<00:01:15.799> copper<00:01:16.670> can<00:01:16.850> become<00:01:17.150> very<00:01:17.360> sensitive<00:01:17.570> on

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
pH copper can become very sensitive on

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.490 
pH copper can become very sensitive on
the<00:01:18.439> fish<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.750> where<00:01:20.750> we're<00:01:20.960> located<00:01:21.140> right

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
the fish and where we're located right

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.670 
the fish and where we're located right
here<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.070> have<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.460> very<00:01:22.880> hard<00:01:23.270> high<00:01:24.110> alkaline

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
here we have a very hard high alkaline

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.600 
here we have a very hard high alkaline
high<00:01:25.189> pH<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.360> coppers<00:01:26.930> not<00:01:27.320> as<00:01:27.530> dangerous<00:01:28.280> to

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
high pH so coppers not as dangerous to

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.609 
high pH so coppers not as dangerous to
fish<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.149> regard<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.780> then<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:30.470> is

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
fish in that regard and then this is

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.200 
fish in that regard and then this is
primarily<00:01:31.070> going<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.280> be<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.430> goldfish<00:01:31.820> pond<00:01:32.060> as

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
primarily going to be a goldfish pond as

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.030 
primarily going to be a goldfish pond as
well<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.659> goldfish<00:01:33.259> are<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.500> whole<00:01:33.649> lot<00:01:33.860> more

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
well and goldfish are a whole lot more

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.889 
well and goldfish are a whole lot more
tolerant<00:01:34.579> now<00:01:35.119> we're<00:01:35.329> going<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.479> have<00:01:35.600> three

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
tolerant now we're going to have three

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:36.999 
tolerant now we're going to have three
spillways<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.530> are<00:01:36.590> going<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.799> come<00:01:36.979> through

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
spillways that are going to come through

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.170 
spillways that are going to come through
and<00:01:37.930> one<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:39.110> going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.350> be<00:01:39.759> a<00:01:40.759> little

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
and one is going to be a little

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.340 
and one is going to be a little
half-inch<00:01:41.479> spillway<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.110> going<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.290> be

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
half-inch spillway it's going to be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.100 
half-inch spillway it's going to be
really<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.159> trickle<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.570> when<00:01:44.780> you're<00:01:44.899> out<00:01:44.960> on

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
really a trickle so when you're out on

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.230 
really a trickle so when you're out on
the<00:01:45.170> patio<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.619> very<00:01:45.829> calming<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.939> peaceful

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the patio it's very calming and peaceful

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.850 
the patio it's very calming and peaceful
and<00:01:47.930> then<00:01:48.320> we're<00:01:48.439> going<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.590> have<00:01:48.710> this

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
and then we're going to have this

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.340 
and then we're going to have this
one-inch<00:01:49.280> pipe<00:01:49.700> as<00:01:49.939> an<00:01:50.060> overflow<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
one-inch pipe as an overflow and the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.260 
one-inch pipe as an overflow and the
majority<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.009> water<00:01:52.219> that's<00:01:52.520> traveling

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
majority of the water that's traveling

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.959 
majority of the water that's traveling
through<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> bog<00:01:53.780> filter<00:01:54.079> will<00:01:54.920> flow<00:01:55.369> in<00:01:55.670> back

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
through the bog filter will flow in back

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.090 
through the bog filter will flow in back
to<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.180> pond<00:01:56.450> below<00:01:57.049> water<00:01:57.469> level<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.950> won't

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
to the pond below water level and won't

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.959 
to the pond below water level and won't
make<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.280> sound

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
make a sound

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.300 
make a sound
now<00:01:59.360> we're<00:01:59.570> going<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.719> have<00:01:59.899> a<00:02:00.259> third<00:02:00.829> element

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
now we're going to have a third element

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.679 
now we're going to have a third element
in<00:02:01.460> there<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.729> well<00:02:01.939> because<00:02:02.149> things<00:02:02.509> look

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
in there as well because things look

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.719 
in there as well because things look
better<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:03.110> threes<00:02:03.469> but<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.100> also<00:02:04.340> going<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
better in threes but it's also going to

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.810 
better in threes but it's also going to
be<00:02:04.850> our<00:02:05.270> safety<00:02:05.750> overflow<00:02:06.380> because<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.520> main

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
be our safety overflow because that main

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.120 
be our safety overflow because that main
met<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.570> main<00:02:08.720> feed<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.620> water's<00:02:09.890> gonna<00:02:10.010> be

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
met that main feed that water's gonna be

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.710 
met that main feed that water's gonna be
traveling<00:02:10.550> through<00:02:10.580> roots<00:02:11.060> might<00:02:11.330> be<00:02:11.450> prone

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
traveling through roots might be prone

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
traveling through roots might be prone
to<00:02:11.750> going<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.830> it'll<00:02:13.340> be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to going to it it'll be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
to going to it it'll be
maintained<00:02:13.890> every<00:02:14.069> now<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> keep

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
maintained every now and then to keep

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.930 
maintained every now and then to keep
the<00:02:15.780> roots<00:02:15.959> from<00:02:16.110> invading<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.760> let's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the roots from invading on it but let's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.479 
the roots from invading on it but let's
say<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.660> neglect<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.800> bit<00:02:20.010> we're

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
say we neglect it a little bit we're

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.830 
say we neglect it a little bit we're
going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> overflow<00:02:21.330> set<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to have the overflow set up to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.660 
going to have the overflow set up to
where<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> roots<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.860> clogged<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
where if the roots get clogged the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
where if the roots get clogged the
overflow<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.660> become<00:02:25.110> active<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> water

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
overflow will become active and water

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.800 
overflow will become active and water
will<00:02:26.489> start<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.819> make<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.239> noise<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
will start to make more noise as it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.869 
will start to make more noise as it
pours<00:02:28.019> into<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> pond<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.950> it'll<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.760> an

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
pours into the pond and it'll be like an

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.460 
pours into the pond and it'll be like an
alarm<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.420> say<00:02:30.569> hey<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.989> need<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.290> some

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
alarm to say hey we need to do some

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.830 
alarm to say hey we need to do some
maintenance<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> roots<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.910> that's<00:02:33.239> what

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
maintenance on the roots so that's what

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
maintenance on the roots so that's what
we're<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.170> doing<00:02:34.379> today<00:02:34.879> let's<00:02:35.879> get

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
we're going to be doing today let's get

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.229 
we're going to be doing today let's get
started<00:02:37.519> all<00:02:38.519> right<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.849> we're<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> have

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
started all right so we're going to have

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.360 
started all right so we're going to have
the<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.720> spouts<00:02:40.290> coming<00:02:40.950> through<00:02:41.220> this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the three spouts coming through this

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.759 
the three spouts coming through this
panel<00:02:41.849> right<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.620> we're<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
panel right here and we're going to

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.020 
panel right here and we're going to
we're<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.190> come<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.489> pretty<00:02:44.700> low

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
we're going to come in pretty low

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.580 
we're going to come in pretty low
because<00:02:45.390> actually<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> bottom<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> bog

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
because actually the bottom of the bog

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.130 
because actually the bottom of the bog
is<00:02:46.890> way<00:02:47.130> down<00:02:47.340> here<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.599> top<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.959> bog

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
is way down here and the top of the bog

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.410 
is way down here and the top of the bog
is<00:02:49.170> around<00:02:49.620> here<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.610> want<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.209> sure<00:02:51.390> I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is around here so I want to be sure I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.410 
is around here so I want to be sure I
come<00:02:51.720> down<00:02:51.900> low<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.829> my<00:02:53.489> water<00:02:53.670> levels<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.120> too

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
come down low so my water levels not too

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.350 
come down low so my water levels not too
high<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.079> bog<00:02:55.290> filter<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.459> first<00:02:57.180> one

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
high in the bog filter now the first one

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.430 
high in the bog filter now the first one
we're<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.110> center

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
we're going to do right in the center

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.750 
we're going to do right in the center
and<00:03:00.019> we've<00:03:01.019> measured<00:03:01.230> 34<00:03:02.010> inches<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.459> between

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and we've measured 34 inches in between

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.900 
and we've measured 34 inches in between
here<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.799> I'm<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.950> come<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.400> 17

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
here so I'm going to come in at 17

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.110 
here so I'm going to come in at 17
inches<00:03:07.640> I'll<00:03:08.640> make<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.819> mark<00:03:10.220> mark<00:03:11.220> there<00:03:11.519> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
inches I'll make a mark mark there and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.420 
inches I'll make a mark mark there and
I'm<00:03:12.269> going<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.450> come<00:03:12.629> up<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.989> say<00:03:13.829> an<00:03:14.129> inch

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
I'm going to come up about say an inch

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.210 
I'm going to come up about say an inch
so<00:03:18.260> that'll<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.350> our<00:03:19.500> center<00:03:19.799> piece<00:03:19.980> right

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so that'll be our center piece right

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.699 
so that'll be our center piece right
here<00:03:20.840> where<00:03:21.840> our<00:03:21.930> little<00:03:22.170> spout<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
here where our little spout is going to

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.039 
here where our little spout is going to
come<00:03:22.889> through<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.299> don't<00:03:24.900> really

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
come through and then I don't really

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.199 
come through and then I don't really
want<00:03:25.350> these<00:03:25.470> guys<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:25.950> equal<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:27.150> to

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
want these guys to be equal I'm going to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.770 
want these guys to be equal I'm going to
offset<00:03:27.660> these<00:03:27.840> guys<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.079> little<00:03:28.350> bit<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:30.690> is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
offset these guys a little bit so one is

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.050 
offset these guys a little bit so one is
going<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.959> be<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.430> same<00:03:32.639> on<00:03:32.880> this

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
going to be there and the same on this

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.930 
going to be there and the same on this
