 sniper rifles 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.350

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.870
 this tale not had too much luck for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.580
 the year 2012 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.900
 Another good here or if you have had the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.350
 luck during the year 2002 ben listens 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.120
 and so much the better 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 in any case this end for me it was 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.220
 still say pretty much my case is going 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.629
 listen otherwise it's full of happiness and 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.280
 I hope it will be good 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.659
 year 2013 and so that's good then 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.979
 listen today we find ourselves for 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.479
 the last episode of rifles 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.750
 precision she wanted there in the beginning 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.780
 of video a beginning of video forgiveness then 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.710
 we end up with the x pm so a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.979
 sniper that I appreciate if only 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 of course since always 1,6 but 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 if not they but still 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 some rather annoying remarks especially 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.390
 when you are on the fourth but 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.979
 they had made a triple file 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 onscreen shine fourth wales and will put you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.560
 to be a marker and who is killing you because 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 this is my thankfully again it is 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 semi-automatic 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.539
 so they shoot without reloading so the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.399
 lock and surya no lock that's 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.590
 the equivalent of a bar is the only one 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.380
 snipers who shoot semi- automatically 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.640
 on this call of duty black ops two 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 ads I say nonsense we have the s 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 Forgiveness I completely forgot es 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.189
 seen by the way about that there was 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.359
 someone who made me commander 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.729
 discover a little trick is that 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:55.530
 I was actually convinced that the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.759
 ranking of the snipers it was ds rsv 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.469
 ballista xbr but in fact it is svu 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.469
 dsr and bashe vista xp 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.480
 so that in madam video finally I want 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.940
 say once that episode 2 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.010
 saw was posted to listen I had not 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.150
 I had not seen but it's true that in 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.650
 the last video is kid ago 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.820
 someone I noted this and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.580
 well listen I apologize I made a 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.060
 little mistake in the london of passage 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.890
 snipers will not want me I think 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.660
 good here is concretely here I was 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.400
 still add a ballistic processor 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
 so this is a sniper who is very very 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.110
 well the only drawback we have 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 develops level 52 or 53 and we pass the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.090
 prestige level 55 good at the beginning of the meadow 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.350
 stylist at the very beginning of the very first 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.820
 prestige it's boring that when you 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.710
 pass the prestige you have a chips 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.420
 you can buy anything me 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.800
 at first I took the ballista led 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.210
 at the second I took the insertion because 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.390
 that here too the insertion develops 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.650
 we studied at levels 50 and after 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.580
 hardly has time to use it 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 other projects I beg them anyway 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.160
 here I could not afford to 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.540
 to make an entire prestige up to the level 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.950
 50 cent the insertion I mean 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.260
 insertion is essential for a 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.910
 feeder I want to say if you then 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.770
 you are very very good but here you go 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.720
 what insertion makes it possible to be more 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.880
 quickly in combat see there for example 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.560
 young spawn there I could have spawn to mons 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.450
 pony deep in the soul ah well here's the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 to directly contact 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.390
 adversaries so that's fine as 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.540
 another integration counselor even at 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.120
 the container tree loaded against you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.770
 will die necessarily that's a lot more of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.280
 time that others who do not have 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.340
 insertion 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410
 mister bah here is inevitably we go terry 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.270
 and then usually we have people who 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.760
 like to wait for five normal channels 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.230
 and one minutes max 2 minutes to 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.390
 insertions then they could have 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.800
 do 40 20 or for example already do 5 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.760
 kills he had not waited but me 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 they absolutely want to do a guide 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.690
 free quotation marks really good 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.950
 voice is not renan the debate so 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 good practice is an expert 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.160
 sniper that I like 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.930
 it is easy to use apart from 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.550
 the viewfinder that I do not like so I 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 prefer to a cross or a viewfinder like 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.319
 the dsr but otherwise 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.480
 otherwise frankly good here frankly 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.530
 I totally hang on this xperia and 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.170
 I think I'm going for the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.310
 prestige three there i'm going i'm going 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.200
 take a token to unlock it and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.389
 have it from the beginning of the prestige 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.499
 since he's really really good at 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.019
 secondary weapon I had a small five 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.700
 seven so here it is simple at the level 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.689
 low assets it was handy 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.669
 extreme conditions and the first 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.590
 it was light weight here and I had a 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.810
 small pomegranate pomegranate centex that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.389
 I also advise it really can you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.820
 out of or for example usually from 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.620
 7 maps and dominations these more bekes 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.940
 taken in fact and you get to satin 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.590
 pomegranate and you do the housework between 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.330
 quotes it can be really good 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.490
 so I absolutely recommend a 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.150
 text scene so that's so low and a 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.349
 fairly common gameplay - so I'm good 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.389
 listen I have not much to say 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.820
 on this experts I have more things to 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.960
 tell us about my next video 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.150
 so it will last fifty seconds 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.460
 since in fact it's the quarter they 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.720
 wait was waiting it was thriller 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.789
 that's fucking I'm doing it excuse me 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.220
 freeroll thriller of the team judÃ©e 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.810
 so here are some ultimate tae-ju clans 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.389
 so here is the first team stage you 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.729
 will see the thriller and so 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.919
 I hope you will like it and edited by 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.880
 hertz and that's I believe the link 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.590
 within its chain on in the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.300
 descriptions here you will not be disappointed 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.530
 they send heavy here listen I 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.570
 wish you a good evening 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.919
 we find ourselves for a neighbor 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.900

 soon go hello everyone 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.570
 Yes
