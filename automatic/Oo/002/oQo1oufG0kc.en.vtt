00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.770
 Change spark plugs bulbs or, for example, the kpÃ¶ 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.829
 seems to be an easy one for most motorists 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.249
 many still do not know it's a problem 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.689
 but that was only possible with older vehicles 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.759
 today's techniques cladding crammed good role more classes 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.279
 many even despair of very tech-savvy hobby mechanics 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.840
 What used to be done without major problems was at the latest 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 Vehicles from 2005 barely possible or no longer possible 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.130
 even the kfz master craftsmen understand the train of thought of the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 Automotive industry often not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.540
 why almost everything has to be hidden in such a nested way and must be cumbersome 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.210
 There remains the question what can or should not be on his own 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 Make a car 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 at the new vehicles 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 and to carry out daily cold are becoming increasingly difficult and 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 I would also what was almost impossible 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.490
 everything over 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.590
 the normal one 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 Caring for the vehicle is also so washing wash 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.440
 maybe even a change of wheels 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.920
 I would abolish it now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.939
 percent of this is extremely complicated for most vehicle manufacturers 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.740
 to renew the bulbs 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.650
 out of the fact that there 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 relatively little space available 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580
 new is that you just to the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.900
 Wieland can not get more 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620
 There are many manufacturers where you actually get the 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.320
 Scheiderbauer expansion must be about a blockbuster 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.440
 Make changes 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560
 The oil change percent is difficult to perform by yourself 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.200
 around here now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 Before we have the percent you have to meet it should be decisive 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.100
 that one more 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 used by the manufacturer 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.550
 In addition, you always have the problem with modern vehicles 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.680
 Percent that this must be the best choice ad delivered 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.330
 that's usually 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.730
 itself not possible 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 is a car master operation withdrawn 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.740
 Percent the more frequent calls 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.729
 from neighboring gas station 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.219
 the us as kfz-master 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.499
 which solution or which vehicle to use 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.119
 so even the big chamber Schleck end even the 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.259
 Picture manufacturer 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.679
 Gas stations there have problems with the 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.069
 just like that and assign 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.499
 that of my view of being and now a change 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.209
 which also not unproblematic 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.040
 while we of course also enters the master business there 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.089
 Meisterbetrieb 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.089
 It's just that you're here 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.719
 the accessibility to the ten candles 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.909
 Percent of the engines Wennemer 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.409
 Construction to which you just can not get to the spark plugs 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.409
 and of course it is very annoying if you 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.499
 not the necessary tools to the spark plug has me in the container 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.659
 can start 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.749
 and who else there might still damage that to candles winds 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.199
 and the winner head 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.859
 Percent then one has tried to save money and ultimately desire 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.599
 produced 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.469
 the brake pads from a non-percentable source is related 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.389
 anyway 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.459
 Percent for me a lobo the percent 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.799
 "From my point of view, I can not work at all 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.139
 which can be purchased already hot 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.819
 APA Kabar in the brand trade want 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.120
 in the parts trade 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.619
 where you know exactly is a brand product 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.949
 around and 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.189
 refrain from doing so 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.089
 Percent to those who like to change themselves 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.719
 Especially with modern vehicles here is partly necessary that the trends 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.409
 Bitronic is reset 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.479
 and percent there percent 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.609
 to then change there throughout the day 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.209
 it can also lead to dangerous injuries 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.719
 if you now have older vehicles percent and craft 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.509
 craftsmanship has 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.199
 then, coincidentally, is still possible a brake pad industries 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.479
 The tire change is certainly a measure you as a private person 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.979
 if you can do that 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.029
 has technical and technical possibilities 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:01.819
 percent 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.620
 Here it is just as important the prescribed tightening torques 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.620
 the vehicle manufacturer 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.829
 the experience of recent times shows that percent goes by will of 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.900
 Old operating system is also carried out by a professional 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.750
 Percent or 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.000
 one has the owner's manual of the vehicle 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.999
 read 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.810
 after operation 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.479
 Content often had the case 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.430
 the percentage points have come and have for example the brake fluid 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.479
 inscribed feared or king brake fluid 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.120
 immense damage would occur just one percent would retract 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 so the student reported that is just a 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.669
 Percent because you can also more will cause a thousand euros in damage 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.530
 we fully understand our customers 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.139
 in the area percent 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.520
 So there is no need for a customer viewers in the car-powered too 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.560
 due to a quick change Soeder refill the operation 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.509
 visibility 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.190
 Even the expert is sometimes hard enough 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.539
 to exchange with Annika 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.239
 Phil can not fix what he sows on his car this time 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.280
 Try to implement some but still on their own often end in the 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.740
 expensive repairs 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.280
 because fixing the episode push the original repair costs 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.850
 easily exceed
