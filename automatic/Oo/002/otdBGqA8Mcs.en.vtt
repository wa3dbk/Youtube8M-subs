00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to get the bracket off you actually I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.300 
to get the bracket off you actually I
think<00:01:05.489> pump<00:01:06.090> pump<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> bolts<00:01:08.189> are

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
think pump pump off and the bolts are

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.020 
think pump pump off and the bolts are
back<00:01:08.880> behind<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> they're<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.729> fun

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
evaporator one of those two I always get

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.470 
evaporator one of those two I always get
those<00:01:27.060> mixed<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:29.930> yeah

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.540 

that<00:01:35.080> really<00:01:35.500> did<00:01:35.800> not<00:01:35.830> want<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.100> come<00:01:36.280> out<00:01:36.430> of

that really did not want to come out of
there<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> new<00:01:40.690> pump<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.230> there<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.710> this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
there get the new pump in there and this

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.480 
there get the new pump in there and this
thing<00:01:42.670> should<00:01:42.940> be<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.590> go<00:01:44.740> for<00:01:44.980> the<00:01:45.040> much

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.980 

look<00:01:48.490> at<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.790> AC<00:01:48.940> works<00:01:49.330> anyway<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.810> this

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
look at the AC works anyway in this

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.360 
look at the AC works anyway in this
pretty<00:01:50.350> sure<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.590> doesn't<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:53.130> needs<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.250> be

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
pretty sure it doesn't I needs to be

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.270 
pretty sure it doesn't I needs to be
recharged<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.210> see<00:01:55.480> me<00:01:55.950> damage<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.130> another

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
recharged and see me damage to another

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.840 
recharged and see me damage to another
very<00:01:57.910> top<00:01:58.270> here<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.800> that<00:01:59.950> was<00:02:00.100> all<00:02:00.280> already

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
very top here and that was all already

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:16.520 
very top here and that was all already
there<00:02:07.770> wasn't<00:02:08.770> one<00:02:08.860> focusing<00:02:09.460> on<00:02:09.550> budget<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
there wasn't one focusing on budget so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.820 
there wasn't one focusing on budget so
get<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.740> put<00:02:17.980> back<00:02:18.190> together<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.830> hopefully

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
get this put back together and hopefully

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.240 
get this put back together and hopefully
