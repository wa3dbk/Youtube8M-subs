00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.290
 As mentioned in the previous videos Nokia puts a lot of value 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 on their listing have to see what he can do 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.730
 in the store there are programs to have games or league 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.360
 right you can see immediately if the EPS are free or not 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.499
 I'll say Mike Grier 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.499
 she seeks he sees Manz 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.879
 but you can also sort them, for example, you can only the 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.879
 latest programs leave ads 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.290
 then there is still the folder of social networks in which all in one heap 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.770
 Cortez are Facebook Twitter and moved 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.720
 very interesting is also the folder programs 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.590
 there are many useful applications for example, and Hoff is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.310
 and if Nokia does advertising for it, I'll cook it on the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.420
 APZ 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 Here you can now let locations be determined 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.080
 up there 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 he is now looking for my position 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.840
 Hannover is not bad 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.980
 he keeps looking 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.160
 and that will probably take too long 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.900
 so so what else is there for features with Jackie m you can in 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.660
 indicate your location to all networks or keep your favorites 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 Then we'll take a quick look at a youtube video 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 again via the folder of social networks 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.030
 I'll just cook it 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 Wuttke also you click the OK 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.640
 Well that's not all around 40 kids
