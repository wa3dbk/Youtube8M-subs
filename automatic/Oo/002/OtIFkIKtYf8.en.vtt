as<00:03:26.520> well<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.390> we'll<00:03:27.570> simply<00:03:27.840> grab<00:03:28.050> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
as well but we'll simply grab the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.910 
as well but we'll simply grab the
motherboard<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.920> guide<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.730> outwards<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.920> we

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
motherboard and guide it outwards and we

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.530 
motherboard and guide it outwards and we
can<00:03:32.040> set<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.310> aside<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:32.880> because<00:03:33.120> what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
can set that aside for now because what

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.800 
can set that aside for now because what
remains<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.170> LCD<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.130> digitizer<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.870 
bezel and only the LCD and repair you'll
want<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.410> careful<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> Pogo<00:03:44.400> connector

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
want to be careful of the Pogo connector

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.400 
want to be careful of the Pogo connector
because<00:03:45.390> you'll<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.959> get<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.230> off

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
because you'll have to get that off

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.100 
because you'll have to get that off
intact<00:03:46.860> as<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:47.760> here<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.900> what

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
intact as you can see here but what

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.110 
intact as you can see here but what
we'll<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.590> use<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> heat<00:03:50.220> gun<00:03:50.250> or<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:51.000> can

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
we'll do is use a heat gun or you can

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.660 
we'll do is use a heat gun or you can
set<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.570> Sun<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.380> remove<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.040> adhesive

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
set it in the Sun to remove the adhesive

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.650 
set it in the Sun to remove the adhesive
tape<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.180> connects<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.720> panel<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:56.510> chose<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
tape that connects the panel I chose to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.420 
tape that connects the panel I chose to
set<00:03:57.840> my<00:03:57.990> device<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> Sun<00:03:58.830> as<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.250> didn't

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
set my device in the Sun as I didn't

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.920 
set my device in the Sun as I didn't
have<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.580> heat<00:03:59.820> gun<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.390> worked<00:04:00.510> perfectly

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
have a heat gun but it worked perfectly

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.690 
have a heat gun but it worked perfectly
and<00:04:01.170> after<00:04:01.380> 30<00:04:01.650> minutes<00:04:01.860> there<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.280> some<00:04:02.490> give

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
and after 30 minutes there is some give

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.150 
and after 30 minutes there is some give
to<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> adhesive<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.770> we're<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:05.010> going<00:04:05.130> to

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
to the adhesive so we're just going to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.830 
to the adhesive so we're just going to
want<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.430> gently<00:04:05.730> work<00:04:06.090> our<00:04:06.270> way<00:04:06.390> we<00:04:06.570> can<00:04:06.690> use<00:04:06.810> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
want to gently work our way we can use a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
want to gently work our way we can use a
little<00:04:07.020> tool<00:04:07.320> as<00:04:07.560> well<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:08.490> once<00:04:08.670> there's<00:04:08.880> a

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
little tool as well but once there's a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.220 
little tool as well but once there's a
little<00:04:09.150> bit<00:04:09.270> of<00:04:09.360> give<00:04:09.540> we<00:04:09.750> can<00:04:09.870> work<00:04:10.020> away

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
little bit of give we can work away

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.660 
little bit of give we can work away
around<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> perimeter<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.040> tablet<00:04:11.550> and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
around the perimeter of the tablet and

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.940 
around the perimeter of the tablet and
remove<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.180> adhesive<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.500> goal<00:04:13.680> here<00:04:13.709> is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
remove the adhesive and the goal here is

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.890 
remove the adhesive and the goal here is
to<00:04:14.130> remove<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.670> panel<00:04:14.940> without<00:04:15.270> breaking<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
to remove the panel without breaking it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.840 
to remove the panel without breaking it
since<00:04:16.200> there<00:04:16.350> are<00:04:16.470> cracks<00:04:16.799> most<00:04:17.190> likely<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
since there are cracks most likely and

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.940 
since there are cracks most likely and
also<00:04:18.480> to<00:04:18.540> save<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.959> adhesive<00:04:19.380> tape<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:19.799> can

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
also to save the adhesive tape so we can

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.580 
also to save the adhesive tape so we can
connect<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> new<00:04:20.520> one<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:22.109> as<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.290> work<00:04:22.470> around

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
connect the new one and as I work around

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.990 
connect the new one and as I work around
here<00:04:22.890> I'm<00:04:23.010> just<00:04:23.130> working<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.700> sure<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
here I'm just working to make sure the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.810 
here I'm just working to make sure the
adhesive<00:04:24.479> does<00:04:24.690> not<00:04:24.930> remove<00:04:25.290> its

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
adhesive does not remove its

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.850 
adhesive does not remove its
from<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> actual<00:04:26.660> bezel<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.410> fairly<00:04:30.740> easy

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
from the actual bezel is a fairly easy

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:42.850 
from the actual bezel is a fairly easy
task<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.550> want<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.760> take<00:04:31.910> your<00:04:32.060> time

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.440 

and<00:04:43.400> as<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.640> can<00:04:43.730> see<00:04:43.790> I'm<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.090> being<00:04:44.420> very

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
and as you can see I'm just being very

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.210 
and as you can see I'm just being very
wary<00:04:44.990> right<00:04:45.320> around<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.620> cracks<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:46.100> the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
wary right around the cracks of the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:59.120 
wary right around the cracks of the
screen<00:04:46.490> where<00:04:46.670> they<00:04:46.760> reach<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.180> perimeter

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.620 

you'll<00:05:00.130> want<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.340> make<00:05:00.490> sure<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.820> glue<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.270> hot

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
you'll want to make sure the glue is hot

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.020 
you'll want to make sure the glue is hot
like<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.020> said<00:05:02.290> I<00:05:02.320> can't<00:05:02.590> stress<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:02.860> enough

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
like I said I can't stress that enough

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.580 
like I said I can't stress that enough
if<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> glue<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.449> not<00:05:04.479> hot<00:05:04.810> you'll<00:05:05.050> get<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.229> lot

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
if the glue is not hot you'll get a lot

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.409 
if the glue is not hot you'll get a lot
of<00:05:05.770> glass<00:05:06.130> on<00:05:06.490> your<00:05:06.550> bezel<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.210> you'll<00:05:07.330> have

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
of glass on your bezel that you'll have

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.990 
of glass on your bezel that you'll have
to<00:05:07.540> pick<00:05:07.720> off<00:05:07.870> later<00:05:08.139> but<00:05:08.760> if<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.850> have<00:05:09.970> a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
to pick off later but if you have a

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.580 
to pick off later but if you have a
successful<00:05:10.540> removal<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.169> should<00:05:11.350> not<00:05:11.500> have

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
successful removal you should not have

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.280 
successful removal you should not have
any<00:05:11.650> glass<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.460> bezel<00:05:12.639> whatsoever<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.660> if

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
any glass in the bezel whatsoever and if

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.070 
any glass in the bezel whatsoever and if
you<00:05:14.410> do<00:05:14.530> you'll<00:05:14.680> need<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.919> clear<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.220> out<00:05:16.080> we'll

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
you do you'll need to clear it out we'll

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.200 
you do you'll need to clear it out we'll
check<00:05:17.290> for<00:05:17.320> that<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.680> minute<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.120> can

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
check for that in a minute so you can

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.060 
check for that in a minute so you can

you see if the display is actually
functional<00:06:59.210> and<00:06:59.449> we'll<00:06:59.569> see<00:06:59.689> if<00:06:59.779> the

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
functional and we'll see if the

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.459 
functional and we'll see if the
touchscreen<00:07:00.229> is<00:07:00.469> responsive<00:07:02.169> see<00:07:03.169> it<00:07:03.259> boots

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:03.469 
touchscreen is responsive see it boots

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.409 
touchscreen is responsive see it boots
up<00:07:03.620> to<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:03.889> Google<00:07:04.279> screen<00:07:04.610> there<00:07:04.909> and<00:07:05.090> we'll

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
up to the Google screen there and we'll

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.029 
up to the Google screen there and we'll
just<00:07:05.569> let<00:07:05.719> it<00:07:05.810> run<00:07:05.960> through<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.349> cycle<00:07:06.830> of

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 
just let it run through the cycle of

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:17.469 
just let it run through the cycle of
boot<00:07:07.340> up<00:07:15.580> so<00:07:16.580> looks<00:07:16.699> like<00:07:16.819> the<00:07:16.909> touchscreen<00:07:17.270> is

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 
boot up so looks like the touchscreen is

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.820 
boot up so looks like the touchscreen is
in<00:07:17.599> fact<00:07:17.840> responsive<00:07:18.409> that<00:07:18.560> means<00:07:18.710> the

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
in fact responsive that means the

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.969 
in fact responsive that means the
digitizer<00:07:19.340> was<00:07:19.610> correctly<00:07:19.939> replaced<00:07:20.389> then<00:07:21.319> we

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
digitizer was correctly replaced then we

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:23.980 
digitizer was correctly replaced then we
