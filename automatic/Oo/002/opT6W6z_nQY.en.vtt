00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.190
 ae 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.030
 where the shops present which kisses 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.030
 that I think 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.520
 I think we can choose how to count 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.800
 sad stories 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.140
 you can relieve by saying that nothing is so 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.360
 bad that can not be fixed with 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 a song by peter gabriel 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.150
 I like this version just like any girl 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.100
 just not true 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:03.280
 This is the truth, and it makes friends only a few. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.900
 Bonder without relapsing the street and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.460
 Fear forgetfulness because it looks at me because 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.360
 is beautiful 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 What is your story? 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.690
 Goose talked about you this is only us 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.870
 friends try to get away from me no 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.630
 decrease the feel for you 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.560
 I am a grenade and one day I will explode 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.900
 destroy everything around does not want to hurt you 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.030
 you can not choose whether or not you go 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.730
 to enter this world but it is possible 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.900
 choose who will hurt you I love you 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 resolve if 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.130
 I know that love is a cry in the void and that 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.130
 Forgetfulness is inevitable. I love you. 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.060
 all your efforts to get away 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 will fail 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:01.660
 what a mess is you very angry 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.369
 Gotta break something, you gave me one. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.950
 eternity within our days 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.630
 you do not know how grateful I am for the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.600
 our little infinity 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.700
 Life is good, English laughs. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.700
 ok ok 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 What are you feeling? 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.690
 then a legal service is replaced 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.830
 someone 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:03:03.579
 I just know I did it even though Lula is 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:03:11.379
 if they did much more to this but did not see 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:16.139
 reason are allowed to pass 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.139
 none to subtract drug
