branch<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> whether<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.340> real

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
branch to see whether this is for real

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.480 
branch to see whether this is for real
and<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.079> must<00:01:58.110> build<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.619> fence<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and so we must build a fence like in the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
and so we must build a fence like in the
zoo<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.659> close<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> animals<00:02:01.380> but

so<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.560> think<00:02:10.209> everybody<00:02:11.209> was<00:02:11.420> singing<00:02:12.110> really

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
so I think everybody was singing really
and<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.610> can<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.819> from<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> photograph

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and as you can see from the photograph

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.570 
and as you can see from the photograph
will<00:02:15.380> can<00:02:15.709> tell<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.280> looks

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
will can tell that this looks

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.720 
will can tell that this looks
interesting<00:02:16.910> maybe<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.709> some<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.100> great

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
interesting maybe for some it's great

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.240 
interesting maybe for some it's great
for<00:02:20.000> some<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:20.840> some<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.380> seems<00:02:21.590> again<00:02:22.010> at

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
for some but for some it seems again at

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.340 
for some but for some it seems again at
the<00:02:22.370> end<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.030> world<00:02:23.300> because<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.170> not

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the end of the world because this is not

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.010 
the end of the world because this is not
traditional<00:02:24.650> showing<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.150> what's<00:02:26.450> wrong<00:02:26.780> with

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
with that that's just showing the trace

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.570 
with that that's just showing the trace
was<00:02:54.200> not<00:02:54.440> enough<00:02:54.800> they<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.370> put

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
was not enough they have to put

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.210 
was not enough they have to put
spotlights<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.360> them<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.930> putting<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:57.980> a

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
spotlights on them and just putting on a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220 
spotlights on them and just putting on a
white<00:02:58.550> spotlight<00:02:58.880> wasn't<00:02:59.450> good<00:02:59.570> enough<00:02:59.600> they

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
white spotlight wasn't good enough they

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.199 
white spotlight wasn't good enough they
started<00:03:00.620> with<00:03:00.800> red<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.280> green<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.790> blue<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
started with red and green and blue and

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.030 
started with red and green and blue and
I<00:03:02.330> really<00:03:02.660> thought<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.350> not<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.860> way<00:03:04.010> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
I really thought this is not the way I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.850 
I really thought this is not the way I
want<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.550> trace<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:05.000> look<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.360> well<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.560> you

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
want my trace to look like well but you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.680 
want my trace to look like well but you
have<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.280> live<00:03:07.459> with<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.640> because<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.510> are

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
have to live with that because you are

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.810 
have to live with that because you are
handing<00:03:09.110> your<00:03:09.230> trees<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:10.310> are<00:03:10.459> out<00:03:10.489> of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
handing your trees and you are out of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.270 
handing your trees and you are out of
that<00:03:11.209> game<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.810> don't<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.590> much<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.190> a

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
that game so you don't have much of a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.210 
that game so you don't have much of a
say<00:03:14.060> anymore<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:15.079> soon<00:03:15.350> as<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.680> part<00:03:16.010> is

that taught me a lesson that that
apparently<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:22.489> soon<00:03:22.700> as<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.269> minute<00:03:23.600> that

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
apparently as soon as the minute that

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.259 
apparently as soon as the minute that
bones<00:03:24.260> i<00:03:24.500> gets<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.160> our<00:03:25.310> hand<00:03:25.880> into

bones i gets out of our hand into

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.199 
bones i gets out of our hand into
someone<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.840> something<00:03:27.769> happens<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
someone that something happens that and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.970 
someone that something happens that and
maybe<00:03:29.720> something<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.500> worst<00:03:30.709> but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
maybe something to the worst but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.190 
maybe something to the worst but
something<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.610> better<00:03:31.820> anyway<00:03:32.329> this<00:03:32.930> gets

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
something to the better anyway this gets

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.740 
something to the better anyway this gets
a<00:03:33.350> lot<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.650> exposure<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.610> then<00:03:35.000> had<00:03:35.420> this

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
a lot of exposure I then had this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.370 
a lot of exposure I then had this
company<00:03:36.230> makes<00:03:36.739> me<00:03:37.010> smaller<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.380> pillars

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
company makes me smaller of the pillars

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.830 
company makes me smaller of the pillars
much<00:03:39.950> smaller<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> show<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.630> exhibit

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
much smaller for a show and exhibit

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.229 
much smaller for a show and exhibit
which<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:42.769> were<00:03:42.890> going<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> see<00:03:43.489> in<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.760> week<00:03:43.940> and
