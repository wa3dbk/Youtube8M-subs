00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.230
 again with new this time we're going 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.180
 to teach them how you can restart your 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.930
 device and asia smartphone or tablet 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.210
 Android in safe mode what is the use of 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.470
 device in safe mode surely 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.840
 users who have any 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.869
 windows operating system version 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.480
 know how useful that restart is 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.670
 computer in safe mode restart the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.710
 equipment and new insurance is to solve 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.600
 any error any problem that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 is presenting as for example when 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.670
 the device becomes slow when the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.620
 device starts to freeze when 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 the device shows you closures 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.510
 unexpectedly with restart the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.969
 device in safe mode is going to 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.100
 restart with basic resources without 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.770
 no third-party program so that 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.020
 you can detect which application you just finished 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.449
 install and which is causing but 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.609
 it can also help you to uninstall 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.740
 once for all those programs 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.140
 or those applications that you want to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.240
 sit down and as much as you want to do is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.789
 very difficult to hoist the message 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.590
 application could not be uninstalled for 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.320
 start your device either smartphone 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.870
 or Android tablet in mode 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.600
 It is very simple as you can see here 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.790
 we have several slices there are four is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.380
 lunch box or launchers to start the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.660
 device so let's choose 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 anyone to see the difference 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.400
 when you start a safe mode or a mode 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.410
 normal to restart your device since 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 be smartphone or tablet android in mode 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.300
 sure you just have to press what 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.190
 what is the on / off button 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.380
 until you get the option to turn off 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.140
 airplane mode or restart and you tell 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.050
 restart and when it restarts then 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.030
 you must keep the buttons on 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.119
 volume plus volume magnets until 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.970
 leave what is the logo then you can 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.280
 and remove it as you can see here in 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.600
 this lower circle is set mode 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.240
 sure that means that the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.590
 device will already be started as they can 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.050
 appreciate that the difference of the first 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.019
 screen that four pitchers came out 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.510
 this time when it starts in mode 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.080
 sure only those that come will come out 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.239
 by default so let's choose 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.280
 anyone although it has already started in 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.650
 what is the safe mode yes we can 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.860
 go to the settings 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.110
 let's go to more and let's go to our 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.549
 application manager and within 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 of the application manager 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.769
 we can already choose what is the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.950
 application that we consider 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.170
 we suspect that is causing the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.420
 device leave errors that the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.329
 device is slow or that the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.849
 device is closing so 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.700
 unexpected or that the application 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.220
 we tried to uninstall the mode 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.769
 normal and for more that we do we have not 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.470
 could uninstall the locate it and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.930
 uninstall the from what is the mode 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.049
 Safe to restart in normal mode 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.239
 you simply re-press what is 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.030
 the on / off button and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.099
 restart normally as I go to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.349
 appreciate here without squeezing the buttons of 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.439
 volume more nor volume less and once 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.159
 that your device starts and if it did 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.170
 solved what is the problem 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.900
 uninstalled the application that 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.970
 I was supposedly already provoking those 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.130
 errors is the problem that is shown to you 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.130
 on your device 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.780
 Well, you will see that your device is going to 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.940
 be faster than there's going to be 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.610
 no error there will be no closure 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.650
 unexpected or as you can see here the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.300
 device has been restarted in mode 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.800
 normal and this is all I hope that you 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.930

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.310
 of utility send us subscribe give 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.290
