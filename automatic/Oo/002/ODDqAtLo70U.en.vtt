00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
concrete this is the forms being built

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.710 
concrete this is the forms being built
here<00:06:00.550> it's<00:06:01.550> all<00:06:01.700> being<00:06:01.880> put<00:06:02.090> together<00:06:02.270> yeah

here it's all being put together yeah

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.170 
here it's all being put together yeah
forms<00:06:03.620> being<00:06:03.830> built<00:06:04.040> so<00:06:04.220> it's<00:06:04.370> it's<00:06:04.700> actually

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
forms being built so it's it's actually

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.150 
forms being built so it's it's actually
concrete<00:06:05.570> on<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:05.900> exterior<00:06:06.320> that's<00:06:06.860> going<00:06:07.100> to

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
concrete on the exterior that's going to

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.610 
concrete on the exterior that's going to
be<00:06:07.310> would<00:06:07.520> face<00:06:07.850> and<00:06:08.150> glass<00:06:08.780> ceiling<00:06:09.380> and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
be would face and glass ceiling and

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.220 
be would face and glass ceiling and
glass<00:06:10.010> inside<00:06:10.490> wall<00:06:10.790> and<00:06:11.090> that's<00:06:11.330> a<00:06:11.540> model<00:06:12.050> of

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
glass inside wall and that's a model of

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.080 
glass inside wall and that's a model of
it<00:06:12.380> inside<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.830> store<00:06:13.100> this<00:06:13.430> is<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.730> model

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
it inside the store this is the model

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.400 
it inside the store this is the model
yeah<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.660> would<00:06:14.810> be<00:06:14.930> actually<00:06:15.080> if<00:06:15.320> you're

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
yeah that would be actually if you're

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.680 
yeah that would be actually if you're
looking<00:06:15.770> from<00:06:16.400> inside<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.850> store<00:06:17.210> going<00:06:17.540> up

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
looking from inside the store going up

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.880 
looking from inside the store going up
the<00:06:17.810> stairs<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:18.200> people<00:06:18.440> will<00:06:18.590> sort<00:06:18.830> of

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
the stairs so people will sort of

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.760 
the stairs so people will sort of
disappeared<00:06:19.580> cool<00:06:20.480> see<00:06:20.660> much<00:06:20.900> in<00:06:21.169> Canada<00:06:21.680> but

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
disappeared cool see much in Canada but

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.980 
disappeared cool see much in Canada but
this<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.039> something<00:06:22.220> else<00:06:22.550> see<00:06:22.850> a<00:06:22.880> lot<00:06:23.300> like

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
this is something else see a lot like

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.850 
this is something else see a lot like
you<00:06:24.110> know<00:06:24.229> something<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.680> you<00:06:24.770> would

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
you know something that you would

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.119 
you know something that you would
actually<00:06:25.010> see<00:06:25.190> sort<00:06:25.640> of<00:06:25.729> more

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
actually see sort of more

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.010 
actually see sort of more
Berlin<00:06:26.459> then<00:06:26.759> you<00:06:26.939> would<00:06:27.149> see<00:06:27.389> in<00:06:27.509> Vancouver

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
Berlin then you would see in Vancouver

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.299 
Berlin then you would see in Vancouver
because<00:06:28.199> people<00:06:28.529> don't<00:06:28.649> want<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:28.889> spend<00:06:29.159> the

money I older buildings you know well
I'm<00:06:31.800> what<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:31.979> perfect<00:06:32.369> representation<00:06:32.759> for

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
I'm what a perfect representation for
