not<00:04:12.849> it's<00:04:13.090> not<00:04:13.180> cheap<00:04:13.449> though<00:04:13.689> is<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.989> really

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259 
not it's not cheap though is it really

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.020 
not it's not cheap though is it really
it's<00:04:14.379> not<00:04:14.469> like<00:04:14.530> there's<00:04:15.099> a<00:04:15.189> real<00:04:15.400> bargain<00:04:15.729> out

there<00:04:16.269> though<00:04:16.719> cheap<00:04:17.560> but<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.979> guess

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
there though cheap but then I guess

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.470 
there though cheap but then I guess
that's<00:04:18.459> because<00:04:18.909> you<00:04:19.630> know<00:04:19.690> DMC<00:04:20.199> is<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.349> huge

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
that's because you know DMC is a huge

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.120 
that's because you know DMC is a huge
I<00:04:21.510> guess<00:04:22.080> they're<00:04:22.230> anticipating<00:04:22.530> big<00:04:22.920> sales

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I guess they're anticipating big sales

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
I guess they're anticipating big sales
like<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.640> don't<00:04:23.850> know<00:04:24.000> how<00:04:24.630> many<00:04:24.690> sales
