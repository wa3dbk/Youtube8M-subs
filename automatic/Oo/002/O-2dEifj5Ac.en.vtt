00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
all the way up there so we capture every

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.760 
all the way up there so we capture every
two<00:00:43.329> millimetres<00:00:43.750> of<00:00:43.870> rain<00:00:44.079> separately<00:00:44.590> in

two millimetres of rain separately in

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.680 
two millimetres of rain separately in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
what we call the first rain separator

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.500 
what we call the first rain separator
then<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:47.620> bring<00:00:47.800> it<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.010> filter<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.550> filter<00:00:49.030> is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
then we bring it to a filter a filter is

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.310 
then we bring it to a filter a filter is
very<00:00:49.750> easy<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.950> do<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.370> can<00:00:51.880> be<00:00:51.970> built<00:00:52.360> in<00:00:52.510> two

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
very easy to do and can be built in two

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.030 
very easy to do and can be built in two
days<00:00:53.500> maximum

here<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.670> how<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.030> filter<00:00:55.390> looks<00:00:55.600> like<00:00:55.860> water

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
here is how a filter looks like water

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.900 
here is how a filter looks like water

comes out through this pipe and goes

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.709 
comes out through this pipe and goes
into<00:01:11.109> our<00:01:11.229> sump<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.819> it<00:01:12.819> is<00:01:13.060> very<00:01:13.270> heavy<00:01:13.479> rain

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
into our sump and it is very heavy rain

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.770 
into our sump and it is very heavy rain
water<00:01:14.560> builds<00:01:14.979> up<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.729> filter<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.659> a

from<00:01:21.130> going<00:01:21.459> can<00:01:22.179> we<00:01:22.299> come<00:01:22.479> closer<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.200> take<00:01:23.409> a

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
from going can we come closer and take a

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.419 
from going can we come closer and take a
look<00:01:23.649> at<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.829> net<00:01:25.499> so<00:01:26.499> the<00:01:26.649> water<00:01:26.799> level<00:01:27.100> rises

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
look at the net so the water level rises

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.219 
look at the net so the water level rises
up<00:01:27.609> when<00:01:28.179> you<00:01:28.270> trains<00:01:28.479> heavily<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:28.929> it<00:01:29.079> goes

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
up when you trains heavily and it goes

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.989 
up when you trains heavily and it goes
