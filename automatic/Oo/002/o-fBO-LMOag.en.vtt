but<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.400> doesn't<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.730> matter<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.330> use<00:01:27.810> my

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
but that doesn't really matter I use my

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
but that doesn't really matter I use my
camera<00:01:28.380> equipment<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.730> get<00:01:29.850> thrown<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
camera equipment this will get thrown in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
camera equipment this will get thrown in
my<00:01:30.300> pocket<00:01:30.780> i<00:01:30.990> might<00:01:31.230> even<00:01:31.260> drop<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> few

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
my pocket i might even drop it a few
times<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.600> exterior<00:01:34.020> condition

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
times so the the exterior condition

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.860 
times so the the exterior condition
really<00:01:35.010> doesn't<00:01:35.370> matter<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.210> long<00:01:36.240> as

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
really doesn't matter to me as long as

really doesn't matter to me as long as
it<00:01:37.050> functions<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.010> it<00:01:38.100> turns<00:01:38.370> on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.000 
downside although you know based on on
these<00:01:54.570> dials<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> stuff<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.590> looks

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
these dials and stuff like that looks

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.210 
these dials and stuff like that looks
really<00:01:56.550> simple<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.870> figure<00:01:58.620> out<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
really simple to figure out now the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.670 
really simple to figure out now the
reason<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.420> wanted<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.840> camera<00:02:01.530> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
reason that I have wanted this camera in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
reason that I have wanted this camera in
particular<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:04.080> high<00:02:04.560> speed<00:02:05.130> video<00:02:05.370> up

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
particular is it has high speed video up

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220 
particular is it has high speed video up
to<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> thousand<00:02:07.530> frames<00:02:07.799> per<00:02:08.220> second<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:10.379> is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
to a thousand frames per second that is

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.300 
to a thousand frames per second that is
very<00:02:11.379> high<00:02:11.620> although<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.099> does<00:02:12.280> have

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
very high although it does have

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.430 
very high although it does have
different<00:02:12.819> things<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.209> believe<00:02:13.540> 240<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.319> then

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
different things I believe 240 and then

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.580 
different things I believe 240 and then
4<00:02:14.680> 10<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.819> then<00:02:15.970> 1000<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.989> higher<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.349> go<00:02:17.379> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
4 10 and then 1000 the higher you go the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.640 
4 10 and then 1000 the higher you go the
lower<00:02:18.810> quality<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.930> resolution<00:02:20.110> you're

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
lower quality and resolution you're

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.199 
lower quality and resolution you're
going<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.250> I'll<00:02:21.310> probably<00:02:21.489> mostly

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
going to get so I'll probably mostly

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.259 
going to get so I'll probably mostly
shoot<00:02:22.989> at<00:02:23.140> 244<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.519> high<00:02:24.730> speed<00:02:25.030> if

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
shoot at 244 for the high speed if

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.780 
shoot at 244 for the high speed if
you're<00:02:25.480> not<00:02:25.659> familiar<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.470> high<00:02:26.980> speed<00:02:27.310> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you're not familiar with high speed that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.820 
you're not familiar with high speed that
means<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.629> be<00:02:28.780> slow<00:02:29.170> motion<00:02:29.709> video

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
means it's going to be slow motion video

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.890 
means it's going to be slow motion video
I<00:02:30.220> love<00:02:30.670> slow<00:02:30.940> motion<00:02:31.269> I've<00:02:31.360> always<00:02:31.540> want<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
I love slow motion I've always want to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
I love slow motion I've always want to
be<00:02:32.019> able<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.260> shoot<00:02:32.620> some<00:02:32.950> actual<00:02:33.340> slow<00:02:34.060> motion

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
be able to shoot some actual slow motion

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.050 
be able to shoot some actual slow motion
video<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.989> not<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.379> slow<00:02:35.890> my<00:02:36.220> my<00:02:36.730> videos

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
video and not just slow my my videos

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
video and not just slow my my videos
down<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.329> Windows<00:02:37.780> Movie<00:02:37.930> Maker<00:02:38.110> start<00:02:38.739> of

down and Windows Movie Maker start of
the<00:02:38.980> other<00:02:39.190> reason<00:02:39.670> why<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:41.200> mean<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.829> I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the other reason why it I mean like I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.190 
the other reason why it I mean like I
said<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.549> seems<00:02:43.000> pretty<00:02:43.390> much<00:02:43.690> completely

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
said it seems pretty much completely

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.520 
said it seems pretty much completely
brand-new<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.690> also<00:02:46.870> like<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.290> says

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
brand-new but it also like I says

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.589 
brand-new but it also like I says
missing<00:02:47.950> instructions<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.239> only<00:02:49.450> other

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
missing instructions and the only other

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.740 
missing instructions and the only other
problem<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.440> no<00:02:51.340> charger<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.150> battery

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
problem is no charger for the battery

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.000 
problem is no charger for the battery
but<00:02:53.470> easily<00:02:53.829> remedied<00:02:54.609> and<00:02:54.819> then<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:56.010> partly

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
but easily remedied and then is partly

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.740 
but easily remedied and then is partly
of<00:02:57.250> what's<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:58.000> as<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.269> can<00:02:58.329> see<00:02:58.480> there's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
of what's in here as you can see there's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.390 
of what's in here as you can see there's
still<00:02:58.959> are<00:02:59.140> these<00:02:59.349> other<00:02:59.650> accessories

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
still are these other accessories

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.349 
still are these other accessories
factory<00:03:00.879> sealed<00:03:01.420> never<00:03:01.660> use<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> listing

really care for this as far as I'm

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.229 
really care for this as far as I'm
concerned<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.400> paid<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.090> hundred

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
use for this printer so just probably

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.150 
use for this printer so just probably
going<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.109> next<00:03:29.410> free<00:03:29.620> shape<00:03:29.859> Friday

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
going to the next free shape Friday

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.030 
going to the next free shape Friday
surprisingly<00:03:31.030> there's<00:03:31.329> also<00:03:31.630> already<00:03:32.380> an<00:03:32.560> SD

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
surprisingly there's also already an SD

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
surprisingly there's also already an SD
card<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.519> there<00:03:35.010> let's<00:03:36.010> see<00:03:36.419> it's<00:03:37.419> only<00:03:37.630> 256

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
card in there let's see it's only 256

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.309 
card in there let's see it's only 256
megabytes<00:03:39.069> that's<00:03:39.819> pretty<00:03:40.239> useless<00:03:40.660> onto<00:03:41.200> the
