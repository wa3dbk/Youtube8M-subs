00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
and I guess it wasn't too far from the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.730 
and I guess it wasn't too far from the
memory<00:00:29.300> banks<00:00:29.570> since<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:30.110> had<00:00:30.259> two<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.619> your

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740

86 Yamaha works bikes still sitting in

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.260 
86 Yamaha works bikes still sitting in
the<00:00:33.379> garage<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:34.010> I'll<00:00:34.700> tell<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:34.940> what<00:00:35.090> I

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
the garage and I'll tell you what I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.729 
the garage and I'll tell you what I
think<00:00:35.450> these<00:00:35.750> bikes<00:00:35.989> probably<00:00:36.320> adapt<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.650> this

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
think these bikes probably adapt to this

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.840 
think these bikes probably adapt to this
track<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.010> little<00:00:37.250> bit<00:00:37.340> better<00:00:37.489> than<00:00:37.699> the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
track a little bit better than the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.340 
track a little bit better than the
modern<00:00:38.300> bikes<00:00:38.480> because<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.870> place<00:00:39.140> is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
were pumped on it certainly you were you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.310 
were pumped on it certainly you were you
raced<00:01:46.640> back<00:01:46.789> time<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.149> fan<00:01:47.420> everybody<00:01:48.109> talks

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
raced back time on fan everybody talks

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.450 
raced back time on fan everybody talks
about<00:01:48.380> how<00:01:48.560> great<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.859> racing<00:01:49.159> was<00:01:49.249> in<00:01:49.399> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
about how great the racing was in the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.649 
about how great the racing was in the
80s<00:01:49.759> but<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.939> think<00:01:50.210> what<00:01:50.299> everyone<00:01:50.539> was

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
80s but I think what everyone was

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.419 
80s but I think what everyone was
worried<00:01:50.990> about<00:01:51.020> was<00:01:51.350> was<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.069> something<00:01:52.369> the

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
worried about was was this something the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.700 
worried about was was this something the
riders<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:52.880> get<00:01:53.060> into<00:01:53.270> considering<00:01:53.840> James

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
riders we get into considering James

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.039 
riders we get into considering James
Stewart<00:01:55.009> our<00:01:55.189> Supercross<00:01:55.729> champ<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.810> same

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
Stewart our Supercross champ is the same

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.499 
Stewart our Supercross champ is the same
age<00:01:57.350> as<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:58.399> event<00:01:58.789> you<00:01:58.909> know<00:01:58.999> this<00:01:59.179> is<00:01:59.329> kind

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
age as this event you know this is kind

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.209 
age as this event you know this is kind
of<00:01:59.569> before<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.380> era<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.859> a<00:02:00.920> lot<00:02:01.069> of<00:02:01.100> these

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
of before the era of a lot of these

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.709 
of before the era of a lot of these
modern<00:02:01.490> racers<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.179> looks<00:02:02.359> like<00:02:02.509> now

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
modern racers but it looks like now

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:03.879 
modern racers but it looks like now
they're<00:02:03.170> wearing<00:02:03.409> wigs<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.740> were<00:02:03.799> on

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889

they're wearing wigs that were on
costumes<00:02:04.340> retro<00:02:04.700> gear<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:04.939> think<00:02:05.179> they're

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
costumes retro gear I think they're

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.669 
costumes retro gear I think they're
getting<00:02:05.479> into<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.810> well<00:02:06.079> they're<00:02:06.319> having<00:02:06.530> fun

getting into it well they're having fun

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.980 
getting into it well they're having fun
I<00:02:06.740> mean<00:02:06.979> most<00:02:07.819> definitely<00:02:08.240> they<00:02:08.390> are<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.810> are

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
getting into it the thing I liked is a

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.360 
getting into it the thing I liked is a
lot<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.470> Lites<00:02:12.740> riders<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.280> we

the<00:02:15.920> 80s<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.460> know<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.610> mean<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
the 80s you know I mean it's just

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.970 
the 80s you know I mean it's just
something<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.080> we<00:02:18.620> had<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.740> chance

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
something like that but we had a chance

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.530 
something like that but we had a chance
to<00:02:19.100> have<00:02:19.190> these<00:02:19.370> bikes<00:02:19.610> out<00:02:19.819> out<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.240> there<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
to have these bikes out out on there and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.880 
to have these bikes out out on there and
they<00:02:20.600> looked<00:02:20.810> at<00:02:20.990> them<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.650> see

upside<00:02:24.470> down<00:02:24.680> forks<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> bottom<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.970> fork

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
upside down forks the bottom of the fork

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.210 
upside down forks the bottom of the fork
sticks<00:02:26.720> down<00:02:26.959> when<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:27.350> ruts<00:02:27.620> that's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
sticks down when you get ruts that's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.280 
sticks down when you get ruts that's
real<00:02:28.459> hard<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.150> know<00:02:29.270> there's<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.810> drum<00:02:30.080> break

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
real hard you know there's a drum break

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.810 
real hard you know there's a drum break
in<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> rear<00:02:30.740> there's<00:02:30.980> no<00:02:31.100> disc<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> rear

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
in the rear there's no disc in the rear

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.490 
in the rear there's no disc in the rear
yeah<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.180> noticed<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.870> into<00:02:32.990> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
yeah I noticed going into that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.350 
yeah I noticed going into that
yeah<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.860> drifted<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.430> about<00:02:34.670> ten<00:02:34.880> more<00:02:35.060> extra

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
yeah you drifted in about ten more extra

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the front brake disk you know that's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.330 
the front brake disk you know that's
like<00:02:39.620> something<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:39.950> would<00:02:40.100> be<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.310> a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
like something that would be on a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.880 
like something that would be on a
mountain<00:02:40.700> bike<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.330> know<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.500> lot<00:02:42.860> of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
mountain bike now you know just a lot of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.830 
mountain bike now you know just a lot of
the<00:02:43.130> different<00:02:43.460> changes<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.480> steel

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the different changes you know steel

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.570 
the different changes you know steel
handlebars<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.530> mean<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.740> feel<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.100> vibration

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
handlebars I mean you feel the vibration

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790 
handlebars I mean you feel the vibration
of<00:02:46.670> these<00:02:46.790> motorcycles<00:02:47.390> going<00:02:47.960> through<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:48.440> I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
of these motorcycles going through but I

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.340 
of these motorcycles going through but I
think<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.030> guys<00:02:50.210> will<00:02:50.360> they'll<00:02:51.080> be<00:02:51.230> alright

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
think the guys will they'll be alright

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.380 
think the guys will they'll be alright
you<00:02:51.680> know<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.800> thing<00:02:52.100> about<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:52.850> back

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you know the thing about it is like back

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.910 
you know the thing about it is like back
when<00:02:53.420> this<00:02:53.750> was<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.960> triple<00:02:54.290> now<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.560> look<00:02:54.830> at

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
when this was a triple now you look at

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.560 
when this was a triple now you look at
the<00:02:55.040> four<00:02:55.220> strokes<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.970> power<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.390> they

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
the four strokes and the power that they

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.690 
the four strokes and the power that they
have<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> torque<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:58.520> can

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
have in the torque that they can

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.310 
have in the torque that they can
probably<00:02:58.910> quad<00:02:59.270> something<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.170> was

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
probably quad something that that was

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.290 
probably quad something that that was
only<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.620> triple<00:03:01.010> back<00:03:01.190> then<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.180> know

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
only a triple back then so you know

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.120 
only a triple back then so you know
it'll<00:03:02.870> be<00:03:02.960> interesting<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.530> can't<00:03:03.740> wait<00:03:03.920> till

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
it'll be interesting I can't wait till

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.740 
it'll be interesting I can't wait till
the<00:03:04.280> first<00:03:04.430> lap<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.820> practice<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.390> see<00:03:05.570> and

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the first lap of practice to see and
