00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:03.215
 Now that we've met you 

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:06.048
 the idea of ​​allelic frequency, let's build on it. 

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:11.064
 Let me make it in a new color. 

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.715
 Actually let me write it here: 

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:20.880
 Principle of Hardy-Weinberg. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 This is an effective rationale 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.340
 what would be the allelic frequency? 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.240
 Or what probability would there be, 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.700
 what percentage of the population would have 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.433
 homozygous recessive or homozygous dominant genes, 

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.451
 or heterozygous. 

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.750
 This really builds on that, 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.967
 which we have already seen with the allele frequencies. 

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.451
 Before we get into this, 

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.884
 we will make some assumptions. And these are just conventions, 

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:49.368
 which give us a stable allelic frequency in the population 

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.417
 from generation to generation. 

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.618
 We will assume that there is no selection, 

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:59.818
 natural selection - and even unnatural. 

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:02.351
 It would change the alleles. 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.800
 People with one of the alleles or the other 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.151
 they will not have a different chance 

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.216
 to multiply and have a viable heir. 

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:14.151
 We will also assume that there is no mutation. 

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.966
 We will assume that one of these alleles can not 

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.984
 from generation to generation 

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:22.567
 change to another or to become 

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:25.734
 in a new scar. Whether green eyes 

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.734
 or something else. 

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:32.168
 And we will also assume that the population is big. 

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:34.535
 This definitely contradicts you with 

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.850
 the example we looked at in the latest video, 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.818
 to understand the idea of ​​allelic frequency. 

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:44.984
 There we said that one of the four genes in this population, 

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.067
 (or a quarter of the alleles 

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.402
 in this population) is predominantly brown. 

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:54.683
 And three quarters, or 75 percent, are recessively blue. 

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.318
 We will allow large populations. 

00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.451
 This is so you can imagine 

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:02.801
 in very small populations 

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.701
 how easy it is to have a frequency change. 

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:09.485
 But for large populations, this helps us to 

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.153
 assume that there are stable allelic frequencies. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.440
 So all this leads to 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.480
 stable allelic frequencies. 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.000
 We have already seen that 

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.452
 if we take the frequency of the dominant mark, 

00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:30.701
 which we can mark with p, and add to that 

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.600
 the frequency of the recessive scar, 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.619
 or the recessive allele. 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.117
 So the frequency of 

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:40.166
 the dominant allele and add it to it 

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.617
 the frequency of the recessive - what will we get? 

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.151
 You see that in this case the sum is 100, 

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:49.451
 or one. And always the sum will be 100% or one. 

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.986
 Because we assume there is only one 

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:53.683
 two alleles in the population. 

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:57.500
 So you have a 100% chance of getting one of these two, 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.136
 whatever that percentage is, 

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.867
 whatever the frequency here. 

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:06.200
 100 percent minus that will be any q. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.432
 So these two things 

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:10.133
 will be equal to 100% or equal to one. 

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.368
 We can now take a little time 

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:12.583
 with interesting mathematics. 

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.117
 This will allow us to start thinking 

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:17.383
 for things like homozygotes and heterozygotes. 

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:20.283
 To do this, let's pick up a square 

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.299
 both sides of the equation. 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.868
 Few algebra in biology. 

00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:26.451
 As we raise the left side, 

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.334
 this is binomial gradation. Perhaps 

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:33.333
 it is good to talk if it looks like you are Latin. 

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.850
 There are many algebra videos in the Cannes Academy on this. 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:49.883
 This will be in the second degree, plus 2 in pq, 

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.084
 plus q uploaded to second. And of course 1 per second 

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:54.783
 degree is equal to one. 

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:56.783
 What do these members mean here? 

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.617
 What are these members? 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.460
 Let's think about something: 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.520
 p of the second degree is the same as p multiplied by p. 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.080
 p is the frequency of your dominant allele. 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.960
 The frequency of the dominant allele, 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.980
 you can also say a percentage of the allele population. 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.460
 The allelic frequency that is dominant. 

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.560
 And multiply it once again. 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.820
 Another way to think about p is that it is 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.380
 the probability if you have to choose 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.580
 randomly one of these genes. Here, of course, I use mine 

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.217
 super-simplified population. 

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.267
 For the truths we find to be true, 

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:35.467
 we will have to allow a large population. 

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.867
 But in this case here, one way to explore p is 

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:41.750
 such as the probability of random selection 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.316
 to fall into the dominant or 

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.966
 the recessive allele; what is the chance 

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:50.451
 to present the brown version? 

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:58.150
 This is one way to look at p: 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.700
 the chance to get 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.216
 B, or the dominant brown allele. 

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:08.751
 And how much does p on p? 

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:12.583
 This is the chance to get two dominant alleles. 

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.932
 Or another way of thinking - this is the probability 

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:22.451
 one of the population to be a homozygous dominant. 

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.466
 This is the probability of someone being 

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:33.833
 mainly B and mainly B. 

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.868
 By the same logic - how much q is a square? 

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:39.932
 It's just q q. 

00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:43.133
 q is the chance to get a recessive allele, 

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.951
 and this is the probability of taking two recessive alleles. 

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.417
 One of his mother and one of his father. 

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:54.983
 This is the chance, 

00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:57.882
 if you are arbitrarily born in this population, 

00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:01.266
 to get two recessive alleles. 

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:05.617
 Then what is the member in the middle here? 

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:11.535
 p on q means pq. One way to think about it is, 

00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:14.084
 if you say: what is the chance to get 

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:17.001
 by your mother at random (you do not know exactly) ... 

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.118
 Or if you choose a random mother and father, 

00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:23.083
 what is the probability? 

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:26.600
 If you get random alleles, 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.550
 what is the chance on the one hand 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.417
 to have the dominant, 

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:32.700
 and on the other - the recessive? 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.700
 This will be pq - p on q. 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.549
 It gets it from one parent, 

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:45.751
 and that of the other. 

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.200
 And the opposite? 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.440
 From the first parent you have q probability 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.750
 get the recessive, and the second parent - 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.000
 you're likely to get the dominance. 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.334
 There are two ways to become heterozygous. 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.000
 If you add these two probabilities, what do you get? 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.880
 They are both pq. I change only 

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.860
 the order of multiplication. 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.020
 You collect these two, you get pq twice. 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.180
 This is the probability of being heterozygous. 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.380
 This is quite a clear result. 

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.083
 With a few assumptions 

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:30.920
 and thinking about this idea of ​​allelic frequency. 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.980
 we can reach this expression, 

00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:38.180
 which is a pretty good way to think about 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.849
 allelic frequency in a population 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.417
 and actually the different genotype frequencies in a population. 

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:46.899
 You see everything is logical, the sum of all these is one. 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.620
 The likelihood of someone being a homozygous dominant, 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.040
 plus the likelihood of someone being a heterozygote, 

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.960
 plus the likelihood of someone being 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.680
 homozygous recessive. The sum of them will be 100 percent, 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.800
 because it must be one of these 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.100
 three things. 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.040
 That's what I'm ending with this video. 

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.060
 And in the next we will really use it 

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.180
 the equation of Hardy-Weinberg to 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.540
 we get very interesting results for a population.
