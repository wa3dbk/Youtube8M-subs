think<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> community<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.030> general

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
think it's just the community in general

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
think it's just the community in general
a<00:00:40.230> lot<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> things<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.430> they're<00:00:41.640> doing

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
a lot of the things that they're doing

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
a lot of the things that they're doing
is<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.629> overdone<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> people<00:00:43.620> were

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
is really overdone a lot of people were

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.459 
is really overdone a lot of people were
doing<00:00:43.829> trolling<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:44.780> some<00:00:45.780> people<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.200> still

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
doing trolling now some people are still

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290

showing<00:00:46.680> gameplay<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.090> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
showing gameplay but they just really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
showing gameplay but they just really
have<00:00:48.450> no<00:00:48.629> personality<00:00:49.140> behind<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.860> gameplay

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
have no personality behind the gameplay

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.450

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
believe people still actually up a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.600 
believe people still actually up a
little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.939> like<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.149> feel<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.649> 01<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
little bit like I feel like 01 I know I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.649 
little bit like I feel like 01 I know I
can't<00:02:02.939> believe<00:02:02.969> people<00:02:03.180> even<00:02:03.420> watch

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can't believe people even watch

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
can't believe people even watch
trickshot<00:02:04.110> anymore<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> also<00:02:05.250> can't

quality<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.709> feel<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:12.150> doesn't

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
quality like that I feel like it doesn't

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.700 
quality like that I feel like it doesn't
make<00:02:12.629> anyone<00:02:12.840> unique

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
make anyone unique

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.200 
make anyone unique
like<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:13.980> not<00:02:14.100> hitting<00:02:14.280> kills<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:15.120> not

should<00:04:43.430> um<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:45.400> honestly<00:04:46.400> think<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.789> xbox<00:04:47.210> one

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
should um I honestly think the xbox one

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.010 
should um I honestly think the xbox one
is<00:04:47.630> slightly<00:04:48.500> better<00:04:48.889> than<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.160> ps4

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
is slightly better than the ps4

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.029 
is slightly better than the ps4
personally<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.199> it<00:04:51.560> has<00:04:51.680> way<00:04:52.009> more

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
personally I think it has way more

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.339 
personally I think it has way more
exclusive<00:04:52.850> than<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.090> ps4<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.690> going<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.139> have

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
exclusive than the ps4 is going to have

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.129 
exclusive than the ps4 is going to have
but<00:04:55.160> on<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.520> other<00:04:55.610> hand<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:56.000> ps4<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.750> going

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
but on the other hand that ps4 is going

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.839 
but on the other hand that ps4 is going
to<00:04:57.229> be<00:04:57.320> cheaper<00:04:57.740> all<00:04:57.889> around<00:04:58.250> i<00:04:58.520> mean<00:04:58.699> the

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
to be cheaper all around i mean the

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.120 
to be cheaper all around i mean the
yearly<00:04:59.210> cost<00:04:59.479> is<00:04:59.750> probably<00:05:00.080> going<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.289> be<00:05:00.349> less

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
yearly cost is probably going to be less

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.070 
yearly cost is probably going to be less
than<00:05:01.160> fifty<00:05:01.669> dollars<00:05:02.030> compared<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.660> xbox

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
than fifty dollars compared to the xbox

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.960 
than fifty dollars compared to the xbox
is<00:05:03.229> most<00:05:03.620> likely<00:05:03.919> going<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.310> be<00:05:04.400> six<00:05:04.639> dollars

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
is most likely going to be six dollars

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.420 
is most likely going to be six dollars
because<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.240> Xbox<00:05:05.630> Live<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.770> council<00:05:07.220> cost

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
because I Xbox Live and the council cost

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.790 
because I Xbox Live and the council cost
is<00:05:07.580> 100<00:05:08.000> 100<00:05:08.570> hours<00:05:08.750> less<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.259> mean<00:05:09.560> really

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
is 100 100 hours less I mean really

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.499 
is 100 100 hours less I mean really
can't<00:05:10.789> beat<00:05:11.090> that<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.770> honestly<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:14.180> I

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
can't beat that and honestly I just I

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:15.969 
can't beat that and honestly I just I
don't<00:05:14.570> know<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.840> lot<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.080> people<00:05:15.199> are<00:05:15.470> proud<00:05:15.740> I
