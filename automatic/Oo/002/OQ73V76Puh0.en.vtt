00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.260 

the<00:00:00.329> third<00:00:00.510> plate<00:00:00.719> came<00:00:00.960> off<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:02.270> research

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
the third plate came off of research

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.670 
the third plate came off of research
about<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.140> history<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:05.509> our<00:00:06.509> food<00:00:07.200> culture

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
about the history of our food culture

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.700 
about the history of our food culture
and<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> came<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.429> realize<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.960> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
and what I came to realize is that is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.459 
and what I came to realize is that is
that<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.219> have<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> pretty<00:00:11.910> bad<00:00:12.540> history<00:00:13.170> when

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
that we have a pretty bad history when

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490 
that we have a pretty bad history when
it<00:00:13.590> comes<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.420> food<00:00:15.420> culture<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> really

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it comes to food culture and and really

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.080 
it comes to food culture and and really
what<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.859> means<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.640> eat<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
what that means is that we eat off of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
what that means is that we eat off of
this<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.050> been<00:00:19.260> eating<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
this or we have been eating off of what

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.380 
this or we have been eating off of what
I<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.100> calling<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.670> plate<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.240> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I was calling the first plate which is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570 
I was calling the first plate which is
which<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.020> protein<00:00:22.500> centric<00:00:23.010> plate<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.400> food

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
which is a protein centric plate of food

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.939 
which is a protein centric plate of food
it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.140> steak<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> seven<00:00:25.830> ounce

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
it's a it's a it's a steak a seven ounce

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.290 
it's a it's a it's a steak a seven ounce
steak<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> little<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> vegetable<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
steak with a little bit of vegetable a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.839 
steak with a little bit of vegetable a
bit<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> grain<00:00:27.830> on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.099> side<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.550> essentially

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
bit of grain on the side but essentially

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.830 
bit of grain on the side but essentially
it's<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> protein<00:00:30.750> take<00:00:31.050> center<00:00:31.410> stage<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.840> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's a protein take center stage and the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's a protein take center stage and the
second<00:00:34.260> plate<00:00:34.730> as<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.790> described<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.260> my

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
second plate as I described in in in my

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
second plate as I described in in in my
book<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.190> sort<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> we've<00:00:38.969> come<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
book is is sort of we've come out of the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
book is is sort of we've come out of the
first<00:00:39.870> plate<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> enter<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> second<00:00:41.190> plate

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
first plate and enter the second plate

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
first plate and enter the second plate
with<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> farm-to-table<00:00:42.210> movement<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
with is farm-to-table movement like the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
with is farm-to-table movement like the
good<00:00:43.320> food<00:00:43.559> movement<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.059> about

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
good food movement is is really about

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
good food movement is is really about
knowing<00:00:45.420> where<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.110> ingredients<00:00:46.590> come<00:00:46.770> from

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
knowing where your ingredients come from

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.090 
knowing where your ingredients come from
so<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> steak<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.620> grass-fed<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so so the steak is now grass-fed and the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.729 
so so the steak is now grass-fed and the
vegetables<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.570> organic<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> grain

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
vegetables are are organic and the grain

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350 
vegetables are are organic and the grain
is<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.430> instead<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> white<00:00:53.969> rice<00:00:54.149> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is you know instead of white rice it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
is you know instead of white rice it's
whole<00:00:54.539> grains<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.370> problem<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
whole grains but the problem with the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
whole grains but the problem with the
second<00:00:57.180> plate<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.690> looks<00:00:57.899> very<00:00:58.170> much

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
second plate is that it looks very much

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229 
second plate is that it looks very much
like<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.100> plate<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> architecture<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
like the first plate the architecture is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
like the first plate the architecture is
the<00:01:00.270> same<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.170> while<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> better<00:01:01.980> plate<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the same so while it's a better plate of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
the same so while it's a better plate of
food<00:01:02.840> gastronomically<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.559> better<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
food gastronomically it's better and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
food gastronomically it's better and
from<00:01:05.670> an<00:01:05.820> environmental<00:01:06.060> perspective<00:01:06.630> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
from an environmental perspective it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.670 
from an environmental perspective it's
better<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.369> architecture<00:01:09.380> dictates<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
better the the architecture dictates a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
better the the architecture dictates a
kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> carrying<00:01:11.310> capacity<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> land

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
kind of carrying capacity that the land

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.770 
kind of carrying capacity that the land
can't<00:01:13.320> support<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.950> least<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.760> our<00:01:14.939> region<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
can't support at least in our region it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120 
can't support at least in our region it
can't<00:01:16.020> support<00:01:16.229> very<00:01:16.500> long<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> growing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
can't support very long for a growing

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.969 
can't support very long for a growing
population<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.840> cuisine<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
population for a cuisine or for a

population for a cuisine or for a
pattern<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.400> eating<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:23.280> times<00:01:23.430> a

pattern of eating you know two times a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789 
pattern of eating you know two times a
day<00:01:23.700> seven<00:01:24.240> days<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> week<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.990> expect<00:01:25.500> that

day seven days a week to expect that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
day seven days a week to expect that
kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> Architecture<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.090> our<00:01:27.240> diets<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
kind of Architecture from our diets is a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.950 
kind of Architecture from our diets is a
huge<00:01:28.710> expectation<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> export<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.689> diet

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
huge expectation and to export that diet

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.120 
huge expectation and to export that diet
to<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> rest<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> world<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> Western

to the rest of the world the Western

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
to the rest of the world the Western
diet<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> Emeritus<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> American

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
diet the Emeritus really the American

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880 
diet the Emeritus really the American
diet<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:35.869> unfortunate<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.590> true

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
diet is is unfortunate and also the true

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
diet is is unfortunate and also the true
definition<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.939> sustainable

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
definition of not sustainable

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
definition of not sustainable
so<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> third<00:01:40.350> plate<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.680> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so the third plate is sort of a way to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
so the third plate is sort of a way to
to<00:01:42.030> kind<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.210> circle<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> take

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to kind of circle out of that and take

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
to kind of circle out of that and take
the<00:01:44.130> progress<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:46.530> knowing<00:01:47.009> where<00:01:47.159> our

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the progress of knowing where our

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889

one surefire way to encourage that is to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.400 
one surefire way to encourage that is to
eat<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.300> a<00:03:25.330> diverse<00:03:25.660> plate<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.200> if<00:03:26.290> you're

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
eat with a diverse plate so if you're

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.960 
eat with a diverse plate so if you're

for<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.850> generally<00:03:34.330> means<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.870> they're

for you it generally means that they're
