00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.830 
we found that the infested didn't fit
our<00:04:08.520> infrastructure<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.209> our<00:04:09.300> league<00:04:09.540> and

our infrastructure of our league and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.720 
our infrastructure of our league and
there<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> few<00:04:10.950> issues<00:04:11.100> as<00:04:11.489> far<00:04:11.520> as

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
there was a few issues as far as

there was a few issues as far as
advertising<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.600> whatnot<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.380> we<00:04:14.010> felt<00:04:14.220> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
advertising and whatnot so we felt that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.920 
advertising and whatnot so we felt that
our<00:04:14.520> philosophy<00:04:14.730> was<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> better<00:04:15.420> fit<00:04:15.660> for<00:04:15.720> our

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
our philosophy was a better fit for our
