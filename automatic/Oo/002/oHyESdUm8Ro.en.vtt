00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.280
 the prefecture of sorocaba held this January an educational campaign 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.300
 with the aim of controlling the emission of black smoke from diesel vehicles 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.300
 that circulate around the city 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.710
 The smoke control campaign says, 'I was coordinated by the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.149
 urban environment and counted with the support of the municipal 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.510
 educational character happened in the avenue independence industrial zone of the city 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.280
 and had as its main commitment the performance of opacity tests in the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.300
 ad vehicles 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 this side or for 100 meters inside the other exhaust is placed the next 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.150
 exhaust event 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.370
 and we do a sequence of seven to ten tests with acceleration 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.310
 the social security registered in the chemical sector the own computer itself 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.120
 government such services 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.480
 what's up guys 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.180
 admitted hearing is going to be talking soon if the way to the standards 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 pre-set by the manufacturer, we have this complementary measure 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.370
 initially 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.620
 not the captive character 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.990
 that will explain that the driver the importance of having a car that the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 he passes in a swimming pool it's making this contradiction with the city 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.190
 and complements our actions here the proposal of the prefecture of sorocaba and that 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.330
 the next campaign already has a punitive character for drivers who 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.530
 with the author of their deregulated vehicles there is some 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.250
 read some data 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.470
 and has a projection of how many trucks the percentage of trucks 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 deregulated in relation to opacity 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.930
 look people have this name of science a dick in the municipality of sÃ£o paulo six 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.760
 months to ten years initial process 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.860
 and initially had 30% diesel vehicles of $ 100 in ten years they 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.730
 declined to 8 percent, we find the index also close to 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.740
 30% average index 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.200
 so we believe that with these educational actions and with these ideas 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.849
 mandatory six-monthly evaluation of our health, no less time and 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.140
 without limits during the 4 hours of educational action 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.980
 agents approached 264 diesel vehicles in addition to reviewing the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.579
 text to city 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.129
