00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello everyone below 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 We invite you to know a little more about the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 processes that are carried out in crops 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.539
 and marketing of flowers in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.289
 Colombia 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.289
 everyone 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 A) Yes 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.980
 This process begins with the purchase of 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.650
 the seeds their price varies between 40 and 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 100 thousand pesos this depends on the quality 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.160
 of the flower 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.430
 A) Yes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430
 plus 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 you select the terrain and the shape of the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 culture then proceeds to pay the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.150
 ground with the rice husk and it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 Pack in plastic bags 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 Later the seed is sown 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.860
 how 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.860
 Y 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.660
 such 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660
 ace 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 this process must be done in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.880
 greenhouses in order to protect the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.880
 culture 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.620
 yes 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.810
 I am 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 the plants for three months in 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.590
 germinate in this time should be maintained 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.319
 constant monitoring and care with the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.319
 cultivation to be successful 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.409
 ah 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.270
 A) Yes 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.590
 After this time, it must be done 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.810
 a series of crop inspections 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.440
 to know if you are ready for 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.670
 harvest 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.120
 what steps should the stem size know? 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 the opening of the button the color and the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.680
 petal texture 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.210
 When the flower is ready, the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.210
 Collection process 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.990
 do not 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.410
 plus 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.920
 after the collection 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.400
 This is taken to special rooms of 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.910
 according to the humidity that the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.910
 flowers 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.160
 there they are packed in boxes that were going to be 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.550
 exported and if they are decoration flowers 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.550
 of skates are kept in the woods 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.969
 the flowers are part of the products 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.939
 with greater amount of export to the 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:08.439
 countries that are exported the most are to the USA 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.439
 europe and japan 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.100
 do not 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.100
 until 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.590
 the flower industry is one of the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.630
 most important in Colombia the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.540
 production in cundinamarca is very 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.360
 important since it generates a large number 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.460
 of work in the department the best 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.090
 quality and variety of carnations 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.030
 mini carnations and astro media are grown 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.160
 in the region cundiboyacense level 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.710
 In Colombia , an international 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.260
 constant growth of production not 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.240
 only in the agricultural activity that 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.460
 generates more employment per unit area 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.760
 but also occupies a space 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.520
 relatively small rich in technology 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.060
 in knowledge and capacity 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.540
 business as well as any activity 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.580
 agriculture depends for its development on 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.220
 good use of goods and services 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.410
 environmental from the point of view 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.140
 environmental can be mentioned two 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.780
 key factors in competitiveness and 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.590
 the future of the floriculture sector 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.660
 Colombian 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.420
 the first the sustainable management of 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.350
 natural resources that sustain the 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.050
 activity 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.000
 the second the harmonic relationship and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.270
 constructive with the authorities 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.270
 environmental guidelines for the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.700
 floriculture that we present is a 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.490
 instrument that describes the main 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.040
 environmental aspects and the measures of 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.520
 handling for the grower the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.030
 Floriculture represents 70 percent 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.850
 of the agricultural product 9.4 percent 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.250
 of the departmental product being a 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.020
 activity that not only impacts income 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.380
 familiar but it has an effect 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.380
 multiplier on other activities of 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.900
 goods and services in the words of 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.290
 statistical yearbook flower growing 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.020
 whose productive enclave is located in 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:21.680
 The municipalities of Havana occupy an area 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.960
 Approximately 4 thousand 500 hectares 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.900
 culture presents a cycle that starts 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.990
 from the button of mother roses and from 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.720
 from this one develops its floral stem and 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.640
 start producing roses from 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.000
 This starts the production line 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.360
 primary 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.390
 the flowers should be fresh the color 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.110
 and cleanliness of the impeccable petals and 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.090
 Stiffness thickness is also evaluated 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.260
 Stem size that are free from 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.260
 plagues and diseases 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.189
 how 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:05.889
 no no 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.889
 A) Yes 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.960
 Thank you for your attention and I hope that 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:23.530
 I liked this video 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.530
 ah
