00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.830
 Welcome to another test of 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.870
 www.mc de This time we were the lg 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.840
 Take a closer look at g2 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.970
 some people are interested in the device 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.099
 pretty much there we see a few 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140
 technical data not just a few 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.500
 few we can see but a few 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.540
 is on it and the device is looking 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.960
 us in this five-part video test 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.939
 closer to the end as always one 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.470
 Summary yes in the course of tests 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.730
 I will introduce everything we catch 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 but first how to deal with the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.949
 outward appearances to the question is only 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 times when the device takes out where 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.879
 this damn switch is me 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.219
 I searched and searched at the beginning 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.160
 I did not know how to start now 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.350
 and yes, we are here at the back 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.050
 you can see here is the switch 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.859
 including the volume rocker we have 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.440
 here you see no glass back 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.929
 but plastic we see here too 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.820
 the fingerprints relatively Doll now in 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.560
 light on the right side we find 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.689
 accordingly, nothing on the left 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.450
 Nothing here except the entrance for 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.090
 we also have the micro SIM card above 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.130
 nothing in front a notifies one 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.110
 Notification led can be found here 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.880
 not to proximity sensors and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.509
 front camera downstairs we find once the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 us the usb input the socket for the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.500
 headphones and the speakers still 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 short times of which camera we have here 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.350
 a 2 megapixel camera in the fourth part 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.689
 our video test i will give you the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.070
 introduce in more detail and behind, of course 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.490
 I want to show you the chamber 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.829
 here a 3 10 megapixel camera and a 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.829
 LED light what we do with it all 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.969
 can and we have some cool here 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.359
 functions effects that you set 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.219
 can 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.869
 Simon said in the fourth part of this 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.969
 video test in more detail 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.219
 yes, what else can we do? 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.409
 say yes the battery is already used 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.850
 I will not take a battery to lose weight 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.310
 we still look in the scope of delivery 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.270
 what's in there we have 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.270
 the user manual headphones 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:19.760
 adapter for the outlet plus 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.040
 data cable and here this tool around the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 insert micro sim card like you 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.690
 can see 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.880
 that they are different from here this time 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.660
 Shaped we have one here and now has 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.970
 to 3000 mAh battery and the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.230
 should according lg 200 already in standby mode 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.970
 keep up 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 I already have something close 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.040
 played with the money and there you have it 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.459
 hardly anything noticed so the battery is already 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.470
 well here we'll see how it in 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.599
 Tests clock is running then we have 16 here 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.360
 gb internal memory which not 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.360
 Expandable is therefore brings you a 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.239
 medium 16 gb or 32 gigabyte version 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.890
 if you want more games you need more apps 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.730
 installed and continued through the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.819
 larger version 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.430
 Also the device weighs 140 grams of 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.680
 price is 480 euros what you here 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.160
 Offered in any case already 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.329
 Good hardware processes and camera processes 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180
 so on I put you in one 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.950
 further part of the video test in more detail 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.769
 yes, you could say it's her 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.040
 maybe a little more expensive nexus five maybe 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.319
 a bit better camera otherwise comes 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.269
 the sender and of course something else 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.040
 Buttons like this are watching you 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.670
 best now in the next part to 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 operation
