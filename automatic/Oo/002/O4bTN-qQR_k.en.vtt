this<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.370> my<00:02:46.489> boost<00:02:46.730> gauge<00:02:46.970> right<00:02:47.540> here<00:02:47.780> you

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
this is my boost gauge right here you

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.179 
this is my boost gauge right here you
use<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.349> fuel<00:02:48.620> that's<00:02:49.280> your<00:02:49.430> boost<00:02:49.610> gauge<00:02:51.189> the

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
use the fuel that's your boost gauge the
