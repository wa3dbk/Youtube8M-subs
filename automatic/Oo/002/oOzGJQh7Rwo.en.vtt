00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.100 
it goes top to bottom rather than front
to<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:38.100> say<00:01:39.000> someone's<00:01:39.329> dropped<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.960> while

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110

standing in traffic or on a drive or
something<00:01:44.299> that's<00:01:45.299> where<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.719> touch

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
something that's where they will touch

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.319 
something that's where they will touch
down<00:01:46.429> had<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.610> look<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.969> internet

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
down had a little look on the internet

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.929 
down had a little look on the internet
and<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.539> seems<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> lot<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.939> have

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and it seems like a lot of them have

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.459 
and it seems like a lot of them have
that<00:01:51.119> scuff<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> plastic<00:01:52.319> you

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
that scuff on that bit of plastic you

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.109 
that scuff on that bit of plastic you
can<00:01:52.500> replace<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.039> section<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.819> bothers

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
can replace that section if it bothers

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.440 
can replace that section if it bothers
you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.669 
you
obviously<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:54.990> no<00:01:55.170> effect<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
obviously it has no effect in the

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:03.950 
obviously it has no effect in the
performance<00:01:56.099> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.209> bike<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.599> any<00:01:57.720> way
