pescetarian<00:00:55.739> he<00:00:56.870> wasn't<00:00:57.870> opposed<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pescetarian he wasn't opposed to the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
pescetarian he wasn't opposed to the
idea<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.489> he<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
idea but he was like I just don't really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.650 
idea but he was like I just don't really
understand<00:01:01.649> why<00:01:01.920> anyone<00:01:02.309> would<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> but

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
understand why anyone would do that but

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.609 
understand why anyone would do that but
he<00:01:04.650> didn't<00:01:05.070> mind<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.150> did<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> one

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
he didn't mind that I did it and one

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
he didn't mind that I did it and one
thing<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.280> liked<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:08.939> Kyle<00:01:09.420> was

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

cooking something and he was always
eating<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> whether<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.909> vegan<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
eating it whether it was vegan because I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660 
eating it whether it was vegan because I
did<00:01:19.020> eat<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> vegan<00:01:19.619> food<00:01:19.979> even<00:01:20.430> though

did eat a lot of vegan food even though

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.280 
did eat a lot of vegan food even though
I<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.090> still<00:01:21.119> eating<00:01:21.420> fish<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.930> lot<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> vegan

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I was still eating fish a lot of vegan

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.429 
I was still eating fish a lot of vegan
meals<00:01:22.619> yeah<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:24.000> yeah<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.320> was

open to it and I think that's really
important<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.250> vegan<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.090> if
