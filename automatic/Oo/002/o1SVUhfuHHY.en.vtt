00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 now that we have branch of canopy and 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.190
 pear orange 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.350
 We're going to take the leaves off to power. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.350
 Use the pimples to pee 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.679
 now I go is ours to shed with 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.909
 bubbles are grafted onto the 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.210
 graft 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:37.170
 first we have to make a cut 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.820
 in the graft port approximately 20 to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.269
 30 cm is from ground level in the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.640
 case of the sachet substrate that 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.469
 It will be time for us to put 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 proud of the graft here first 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.989
 Preferably, we choose one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 smooth region to facilitate also the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.260
 cut will do what we do 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.559
 cut in the bottom first with the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.559
 switchblade 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:16.380
 then we make a cut in the center of the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 branch forming the inverted T 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 cut here the cut in the center of the river where 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.579
 It usually opens a bit here for 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.579
 facilitate the introduction of the gem 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 when the graft port is bark 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.229
 good, he just home easily 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.009
 so we're going to remove this gem and I know 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.040
 there placed in the text region of the same 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.630
 thing that makes the cut on the bottom 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:54.829
 and removes the gem by sliding 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.719
 pocketknife calmly withdrawal bubbles 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.079
 preference, people do not touch their 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.469
 underneath too, do not go people 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.790
 put here now and will introduce 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:15.640
 this handcuff 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:17.620
 under the bark until it ends where the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 people have t cut 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 this bubble has been introduced below 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440
 of bark 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 thereafter we need to cover 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.140
 this bubble does not dehydrate 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.660
 favela and there is also no problem 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.730
 has a problem with water entering the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.910
 region that was placed this bubble 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.860
 we use the plastic fetish that is 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.380
 very flexible 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.810
 if you pick up and if this step you can 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.940
 explain to him completely that he does not 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.560
 story of the good classic to us after 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:04.600
 will make the cover of this gem do 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.710
 start holding here and come pulling 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.030
 little plastic diagonal and comes 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:17.620
 fully covering the agenda for those who do not 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.360
 There is a problem with water and even 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.830
 also from dear nÃ© that dehydrates gem 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.770
 pride in the case with ease 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:32.290
 We have to leave just being 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.430
 fully covered and the company to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.670
 finish stretching a little plastic 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.670
 and gift 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.880
 that's enough to cover the agenda now 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.890
 done that from now on 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.330
 It matters to us is the budding in this 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.430
 gemma that will be the new cup 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.580
 so we have to do is break 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.360
 this apical dominance of uncertain size 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.460
 why all the concentration of dioxin 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.260
 stay in this gem in this new gm that 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.220
 people put it here that's going to be the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.850
 new plant 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.040
 then what producers do after 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.870
 this is breaking broken apical dominance 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.870
 making a wingspan 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:30.760
 Do this wingspan the purple run and come 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.580
 bending as much as you can to break 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.440
 dominance is a matter here with the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.350
 We only have one Amorim bag that 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.800
 We're going to make a 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 mooring here for this gt to this branch a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:55.060
 this branch is not only worth doing 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.570
 a mooring here seems to already call 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.570
 come back 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.980
 then we want the apical dominance 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.810
 most everything is close to this tragedy 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.690
 that we introduce there in the door 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.730
 new graft then from now on 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.730
 this amount will be approximately 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.180
 15 days 15 to 20 days here where we only 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.580
 we want this agenda picked up is not exaggeration 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.070
 to stay green is because she got 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.400
 his side if the law if it dry is easy 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.890
 also to observe the reason for the effective 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.530
 be transparent 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.380
 so if she picks up after 15 days we 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.080
 let's make the withdrawal of this cash 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.960
 We're going to do that now as well. 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.540
 if this gem had pima a thing if 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.440
 It is also observed that during this 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.419
 period the ps / port uncertain is going 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.150
 folded up 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.730
 there will be many votes both below 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.480
 of the institute as above is a 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.990
 another technique that we use is 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.360
 keep making these boots so that there is 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.570
 all the vigor of the plant is that the plant 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.490
 He is now leading all the sap is 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.200
 just concentrate on this general here we go 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.560
 suppose that it is past fifteen 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.110
 days 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.850
 will take the festival south, which 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:32.040
 People would do it now, let's put ivete to 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.950
 people making would make a cut is taking 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.860
 be careful not to cut near the 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:44.130
 people would make a cut in the back 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:46.669
 right mooring and withdraw such 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.669
 plastic 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.660
 here is this handcuff and she will start to 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:59.040
 develop and we continue to 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:02.580
 making the route horse down over the 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.300
 graft until these plants are s 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.760
 in this agenda develops there we go 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.590
 training in the future. 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.600
 this can be that way so that it 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.290
 grow up straight and as soon as he has 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.800
 developed we will cut the part 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.790
 of the horse and leaving only one 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.790
 develop in this plant
