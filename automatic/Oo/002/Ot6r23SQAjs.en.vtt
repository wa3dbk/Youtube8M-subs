00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and grade them only from one side so

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.440 
and grade them only from one side so
that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.780> big<00:01:58.530> strands<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.030> Prados

so create them in one direction only

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.960 
so create them in one direction only
then<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.140> parados<00:02:07.469> are<00:02:07.740> parboiled<00:02:08.369> much

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
then if the parados are parboiled much

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.740 
then if the parados are parboiled much
better<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.099> beta<00:02:11.790> strands

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
better because then you get beta strands

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.630
