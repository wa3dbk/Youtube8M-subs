00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.000
 ohl were many thanks to our image is a pleasure to be here with 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.759
 you today I am a commercial architect 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.580
 and all a bit of the profession of what I had foreseen a little bit of other 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.609
 optics that one of the bodies 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.470
 we all have a body with which we relate a body 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.560
 In attention to 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 which we want to change some way and we need to accept also 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.029
 that's going through tattoos for change for things 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.700
 for the body in contemporary contemporaneous culture esponje twal 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.329
 hoisting 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.829
 there is a point of the human body hospitalization as object 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:39.530
 sexual 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.079
 or as an artistic object for example Spanish tatita 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.630
 a manifesto was already issued 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.960
 and transforms the human bodies the furniture 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 the body furniture 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.120
 percent and quarters 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.639
 the architects have a very special bond with the buildings 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:57.459
 somehow the buildings and things can be embodied that the process 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:58.200
 reverse 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.350
 but more than for example is a party in the same sense sandoval sorto 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 where each mossos builder and trace his own building and is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.840
 van-halen pour the one that will get 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.620
 and both the other buildings 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.400
 also in the prosopopeya somehow buildings take life come alive 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 they are related to the sexual sele the trailer for example discovered with him 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 the fog this is making love in the zeppelin is a condom 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.100
 eager to bed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.899
 is covered by the rockefeller center slow bulls building not only 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.000
 sees it 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.440
 and at the same time it is illuminated by 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.930
 the statue the freedom but also that body huge curiosity 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.369
 curiosity that the field of art also comes 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.090
 things for example these works gordon matta-clark tries to judge masses at 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.430
 that you see in the architecture 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.780
 Well, I have been able to exhibit an exhibition that a couple of years ago toured the world 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.650
 that with corpses real human bodies dissected transform the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.080
 sea ​​in works of art 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.930
 but the teacher procedures before always changing channels 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.740
 just as we could geography like a huge body like a great room 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 that we inhabited somehow if this were so 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.850
 the city could also be seen as a huge cavernous surface 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.759
 giant stone with enormous small qualities in which we inhabit 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.139
 and if this were so 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.609
 what would the body that identifies us all be like? 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:17.069
 monterianos that body would have and where it comes from how it was drawn 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.260
 some way 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.359
 that silhouette 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.760
 in which today we inhabit 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.369
 and with whom we relate and also sometimes we need to change 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.779
 as would have been the construction 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.920
 no doubt that it was composed of optimism 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.709
 he confessed yes he is there is not 20 mainly a huge vital optimism 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.809
 there are two symbols that I like very much to criticize this 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.519
 on the one hand the centennial stadium 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.459
 a work that according to your sauce and months to become the first world 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.919
 soccer six months 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.459
 to the victims 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.849
 to this advanced technology of the moment and if that were not enough, we are champions in 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.890
 that same stadium 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.230
 another work that I love to show for demonstration of this in the southern ravine of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.050
 Montevideo 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.500
 then you know will never tell if that was not so geography does not 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.880
 did and there were places 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.680
 this is the image of the construction 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.080
 somehow the modern these builders of the monterian body that 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.800
 we inhabit 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 they will be encouraged to draw a silhouette of montevideo 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.869
 you have to look for something else to have the illusion of changing around that 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.400
 then comes a pretty complicated story I think they come 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.670
 a decade soto al aek to 60 and 70 pretty happy complicated 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.019
 conflictivity of 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.550
 this one that believes that another thing the difficulty to recognize his own room 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.580
 the difficulty of creating symbols do and cough to generate the architecture itself 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.580
 create a procuraduría a change our own city 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.120
 As if it were not enough, the economic crisis we are living in Latin America 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.239
 generated that if we continue with the metaphor of the body the cells 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.900
 they started reproducing an almost metastatic mode 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.320
 without apparent control 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.270
 where the two places of informality end up expanding 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.310
 conforming much more the limit of the body of that corporation to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.590
 contemporary of what 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.459
 It was previously I think 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.010
 that as I said frank 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.450
 perhaps we are in a position to propose a parricide I mean d 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.150
 On the one hand, be aware that we can not continue changing the silhouette 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.239
 the moderns and building our body as a partner at the beginning of the century 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.969
 but on the other hand I also think that we can not resign ourselves despite the fact that only 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.789
 from the lack of control can grow steles the hunt then I want to tell you 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.559
 An example 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.879
 that we did the study that we share with pressure sockets because tuset 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.370
 architect mac heap is bad insults and named him 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.980
 which is a ccoo contest for 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.990
 the bank reported eastern Uruguay on land that is here 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.990
 facing the old building 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.790
 aesthetic and has as a challenge nothing more and nothing less than to build up 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.830
 year montevideo 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.120
 what we proposed was a week 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.220
 but this pe leaving from the base of what the proposed program would occupy 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.360
 will occupy almost expand the ground 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.110
 try to compact as much as possible towards the sides as to create a 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.210
 sunny square 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.440
 then compress them as to carver building that was behind 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.070
 elevate us as to generate that silhouette and then such a geometry that was 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.139
 recognizable 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.360
 Now you do not see anything at all but you are going to have to believe me imagine 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.409
 from the point of view of setting up the plan e so that a very very very simple thing 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.939
 we had a bank structure with public technical situations one side 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:04.639
 checkbook 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.500
 we had a public road we had a cultural area and with a leisure area 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.320
 and what we try to generate especially in what we were very interested in generating 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.130
 it was a milestone an element that in the way that will expand the corporeality which we are 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.080
 living 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.370
 we were very interested in creating up all 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.130
 a public square a place that could not be raised or floated towards 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.979
 120 meters above the level of the bay and be able to observe everything that was 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.159
 happening in the city to look at ourselves the tail as 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.120
 invited so this team did not the building had to be 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.589
 no physios and 91 days a hit and still valid and somehow 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.970
 cool their facades and somehow 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.260
 this use of photovoltaic panels the water of his escape despite 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.889
 have an energetic behavior that identifies us 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.339
 and that the interiors 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.030
 it was also a celebration 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.740
 italy allowed to have multiple space heights 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.010
 and also lets not have some appointments 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.270
 with architecture that represents the bank but above all had this space to 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.460
 out as a large plaza to the counselor your benefit to society 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.740
 there is a tourist that would depend on cruises and go up there there will be 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.719
 city ​​like to celebrate the city of montevideo 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.599
 as to know her for knowing her room and also for ourselves 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.259
 we imagined all this plus a kind of lighthouse lit the night 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.819
 and house on those 120 meters we could be watching and dining 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.319
 and carrying our city 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.080
 What we also thought was that the activity itself would be what it would take 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.960
 to the building 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.860
 because it's the last thing I want to share with you is a sunset over 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.410
 bay of montevideo that we imagine somehow this where we 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.889
 we imagined sworn this active rambla an active room a plane sunset 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.710
 there is little left and you can see that the video did not come out but it matters 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.270
 is coming off little by little it was going on this 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.099
 what is what this new corporation was that wanted mode 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.059
 for tranquility all of you I gave calm order 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.309
 what the jury was quite more sensible than us and this barbarism is not going to 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:05.000
 build 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.990
 in the pot montevideo
