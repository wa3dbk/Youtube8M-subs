and efficiently the print we're going to
do<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> six<00:01:36.720> pass<00:01:37.100> print<00:01:38.100> onto<00:01:38.310> poster

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
do now is a six pass print onto poster

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
do now is a six pass print onto poster
paper<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.140> should<00:01:40.350> print<00:01:40.530> fairly<00:01:41.189> quickly

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
paper so it should print fairly quickly

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
paper so it should print fairly quickly
the<00:01:42.000> productivity<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> printer<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.350> one

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the productivity of the printer is one

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
the productivity of the printer is one
of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> key<00:01:43.799> things<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.220> sold<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> us<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.570> be

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of the key things I sold it to us to be

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.499 
of the key things I sold it to us to be
able<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> print<00:01:46.369> at<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> quality<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.119> good<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.390> we

having a prince of the prints a bit
quicker<00:01:54.840> might<00:01:55.170> mean<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.590> home<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> bit
