 dawson 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.809
 to remember what was integrated 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.970
 started integrating the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.129
 and it has been integrated into the following 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.610
 devices like the nou 3 or with the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.880
 updates in s 3 on autos- 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.250
 a garzon adapts or performs an analysis of 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.250
 our ears when we connect the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.700
 headphones and activate the application and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.470
 tells us how you can improve the quality 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.390
 of the audio in each of our ears 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.330
 both on the left and on the right 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.340
 The following news is you group grup 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.920
 I was already part of the Samsung Galaxy 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.550
 s 4 and the galaxy nou 3 and now it 's the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.050
 turn that integrates the galaxy s3 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 let's remember what group le groupe is 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.340
 it allowed us to share music with 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.040
 various devices and play 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.100
 various songs photos videos and so on 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.680
 etcetera group play also integrated the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.890
 ie share game function 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.979
 play with people or be able to see 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.350
 videos that is to be able to reproduce in 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.450
 different phones the same video 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.000
 the next novelty is smart rotation 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.509
 what I was doing is more broken from the station 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.969
 was that even if we had the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.060
 tilted head the mobile does not spin anymore 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.329
 saying on the screen would tilt according to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.399
 we looked at moving here is putting you 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.160
 a sample video of how it would work 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.230
 the new use also integrates a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.100
 new function that we could also 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.100
 find the previous ones of alexis 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.320
 which is called sound and shout that we 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.180
 let me take a picture and at the same time 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.180
 record 9 seconds of audio 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.400
 It also allows us to choose if we want 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.609
 record the audio before performing the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.409
 photo or after taking the photo the s3 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.260
 integrates new features in the xbox 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.329
 apart from that includes the small and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.909
 redesigned interface that we could 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.849
 find in the previous galaxy not in 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:52.120
 the previous galaxies and that in addition we 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.379
 it allows to install the dts hd that is to say a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.510
 clearer voice that is better defined and 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.219
 that does not seem as robotic as those that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.680
 We could find the previous ones as 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.299
 for example in the galaxy s2 the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.639
 authorization also allows us 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.449
 install new widgets on the screen 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.250
 lock thanks to android 4.3 as 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.699
 you can see I can put widget 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.169
 google now music and you can add more 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.169
 according to my needs 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.000
 It also allows me to edit the order of 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.000
 each of the widgets 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.530
 the new music application that new 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.609
 has nothing but now allows us 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.069
 be able to control the songs with the 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.500
 voice control that is to say with a series of 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.530
 commands allows us to pause play 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.349
 pass the next one or go to the previous one 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.409
 song simply by saying to the mobile 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.750
 and without needing to touch it now in the 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.319
 screen settings we can find the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.510
 screen mode and allows us to activate 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.970
 the optimize screen mode is to say the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.680
 mobile as detected on the sensors will go 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.319
 optimizing both the contrast with the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.239
 brightness and colors of the screen 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:14.889
 large 4.2.2 and with 4.3 we could already 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.380
 slide with both fingers and expand the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.539
