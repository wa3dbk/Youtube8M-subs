00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
wondering my head measures at 21 and a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.220 
wondering my head measures at 21 and a
half<00:00:24.510> inches<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.380> 22<00:00:25.680> inches<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.510> I<00:00:27.510> use<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
half inches to 22 inches and I use a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
half inches to 22 inches and I use a
skybox<00:00:28.590> pad<00:00:29.310> sucked<00:00:29.609> inside<00:00:31.399> not<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
skybox pad sucked inside not because the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.010 
skybox pad sucked inside not because the
harness<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.480> too<00:00:34.790> snug<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> fact

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
harness was too snug just for the fact

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
harness was too snug just for the fact
that<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.710> didn't<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> harness

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that I didn't really like the harness

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
that I didn't really like the harness
that<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> came<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.960> plan<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.230> using<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that it came with and I plan on using a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.090 
that it came with and I plan on using a
box<00:00:41.160> liner<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> video<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
box liner but this is just a video to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
box liner but this is just a video to
give<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.280> guys<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.820> idea<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> sizing<00:00:45.750> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
says 53 to 59 centimeters til I get the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.090 
says 53 to 59 centimeters til I get the
camera<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> focus<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.040> see

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
camera to focus on it but as you can see

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.380 
camera to focus on it but as you can see
it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> size<00:01:11.580> medium<00:01:11.760> large<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.770> 59<00:01:13.850> 53<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> 59

it's a size medium large and 59 53 to 59
centimeters<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.509> inside<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> took<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.380> all

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
centimeters so the inside I took off all

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.690 
centimeters so the inside I took off all
the<00:01:19.799> pads<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.030> see<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.340> be<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.580> little

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the pads so you can see and be a little

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.749 
the pads so you can see and be a little
bit<00:01:23.909> easier<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.330> me<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> measure<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
bit easier for me to measure so from the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.200 
bit easier for me to measure so from the
inside<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> front<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.030> I'll

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
inside to the front you know what I'll

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
inside to the front you know what I'll
use<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> different<00:01:33.619> measuring<00:01:34.619> tape<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
use a different measuring tape so you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
use a different measuring tape so you
guys<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.820> better<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> inner

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
guys can see a bit better so the inner

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.240 
guys can see a bit better so the inner
diameter<00:01:39.560> from<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> front<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.000> back<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
diameter from the front to the back is

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.210 
diameter from the front to the back is
nine<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> three<00:01:44.640> quarters<00:01:45.860> nine<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> three

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
nine and three quarters nine and three

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.109 
nine and three quarters nine and three
quarters<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.930> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> sides<00:01:50.030> directly<00:01:51.030> in

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
quarters and on the sides directly in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.570 
quarters and on the sides directly in
the<00:01:51.210> middle<00:01:53.299> is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
the middle is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.210 
the middle is
seven<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.690> half<00:01:57.260> these<00:01:57.620> are<00:01:57.740> inches<00:01:58.040> by<00:01:58.160> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
seven and a half these are inches by the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.730 
seven and a half these are inches by the
way<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.490> seven<00:01:58.820> half<00:01:58.940> inches<00:02:01.150> now<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:03.080> depth

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
way so seven half inches now the depth

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.980 
way so seven half inches now the depth
on<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.400> front<00:02:04.640> I'll<00:02:05.150> do<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.450> one<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.780> got<00:02:05.900> to

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
on the front I'll do that one I got to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.870 
on the front I'll do that one I got to
do<00:02:06.050> with<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.290> small<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:06.860> they<00:02:07.520> want<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.820> be

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
do with the small one as they want to be

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.950 
do with the small one as they want to be
a<00:02:07.910> bit<00:02:08.119> too<00:02:08.270> difficult<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:09.850> guess<00:02:10.850> in<00:02:11.330> their

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.699 

measures<00:02:14.960> at

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.349 

eleven<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.579> a<00:02:21.670> half<00:02:21.730> inches<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:25.209> what<00:02:25.299> I

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
eleven and a half inches so what I

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.679 
eleven and a half inches so what I
measure<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.969> measure<00:02:28.329> it<00:02:28.510> all

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
measure it from here and measure it all

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.800 
measure it from here and measure it all
the<00:02:28.840> way<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.549> side<00:02:30.549> there's<00:02:31.329> just<00:02:31.510> eleven<00:02:31.750> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the way in side there's just eleven and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.869 
the way in side there's just eleven and
a<00:02:31.870> half<00:02:31.900> inches<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:33.069> from<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> front<00:02:33.609> to<00:02:33.819> the

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
a half inches now from the front to the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:42.599 
a half inches now from the front to the
back<00:02:39.840> measure<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.079> right<00:02:41.769> about<00:02:42.040> 16

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
back measure is that right about 16

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.030 
back measure is that right about 16
inches<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.519> 16<00:02:45.909> inches<00:02:46.150> from<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.769> from<00:02:47.769> here

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
inches so 16 inches from here from here

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.009 
inches so 16 inches from here from here
and<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.000> measures<00:02:49.120> all<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.689> way<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
inside up to the front right here now

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.069 
inside up to the front right here now
I'll<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.680> another<00:02:53.829> measurement<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.930> where<00:02:55.930> the
