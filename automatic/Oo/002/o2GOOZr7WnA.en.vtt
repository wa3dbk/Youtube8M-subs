00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
would have gone with the longer snout

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.150 
would have gone with the longer snout
but<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:06.600> terms<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.140> movie<00:04:07.470> accuracy<00:04:07.980> it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
but in terms of the movie accuracy it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.720 
but in terms of the movie accuracy it

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.719 
he regrew he didn't originally have this
dr.<00:04:35.970> Connors<00:04:36.330> do<00:04:36.450> not<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.770> guess<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.580> makes

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
dr. Connors do not so I guess it makes

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.240 
dr. Connors do not so I guess it makes
sense<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.090> be<00:04:39.390> more<00:04:39.570> more<00:04:40.169> lizard-like<00:04:40.530> than

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
sense that be more more lizard-like than

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.690 
sense that be more more lizard-like than
this<00:04:41.400> one<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:46.050> paint's<00:04:46.440> nice<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.979> isn't

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
this one so the paint's nice it isn't

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.519 
this one so the paint's nice it isn't
just<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.940> straight<00:04:48.180> green<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.720> does<00:04:48.870> have<00:04:49.110> some

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
just a straight green it does have some

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.439 
just a straight green it does have some
for<00:04:50.219> brown<00:04:51.079> attitude<00:04:52.079> and<00:04:52.289> some<00:04:52.439> darker<00:04:52.799> green

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
for brown attitude and some darker green

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.789 
for brown attitude and some darker green
looks<00:04:54.449> very<00:04:54.899> very<00:04:55.049> nice<00:04:55.459> the<00:04:56.839> chest<00:04:57.839> area<00:04:58.199> I

00:04:58.789 --> 00:04:58.799 
looks very very nice the chest area I

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.849 
looks very very nice the chest area I
feel<00:04:59.099> could<00:04:59.249> use<00:04:59.399> a<00:04:59.429> little<00:04:59.639> more<00:04:59.789> texturing

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:00.859 
feel could use a little more texturing

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:03.559 
feel could use a little more texturing
but<00:05:01.859> it<00:05:02.009> certainly<00:05:02.339> does<00:05:02.639> not<00:05:02.669> look<00:05:02.909> bad<00:05:03.239> by

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
but it certainly does not look bad by

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.229 
but it certainly does not look bad by
any<00:05:03.599> means<00:05:04.159> you<00:05:05.159> just<00:05:05.279> gotta<00:05:05.609> let<00:05:06.059> see<00:05:06.209> how

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:06.239

review of the lizard from the amazing
spider-man<00:06:28.199> movie<00:06:28.679> line<00:06:28.909> I<00:06:29.909> really<00:06:30.539> wish<00:06:30.689> they

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:33.059 
would have done a Joe articulation I

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.939 
would have done a Joe articulation I
think<00:06:33.239> that<00:06:33.389> have<00:06:33.539> been<00:06:33.659> cool<00:06:33.899> on<00:06:34.139> the

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
think that have been cool on the

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.039 
think that have been cool on the
packaging<00:06:35.579> of<00:06:35.699> look<00:06:35.849> like<00:06:35.879> he<00:06:36.389> originally<00:06:36.569> had

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:37.049 
packaging of look like he originally had

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:39.889 
packaging of look like he originally had
it<00:06:37.229> and<00:06:37.439> it<00:06:38.039> was<00:06:38.129> taken<00:06:38.579> out<00:06:38.699> later<00:06:38.939> but<00:06:39.779> the

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:39.899 
it and it was taken out later but the

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.139 
it and it was taken out later but the
mouth<00:06:40.079> is<00:06:40.259> done<00:06:40.529> fairly<00:06:41.489> well<00:06:41.669> of<00:06:41.879> course<00:06:42.059> you
