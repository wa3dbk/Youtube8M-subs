00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone welcome on my channel 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 today we are going to talk about polish to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 nails and not just any varnish 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.179
 siat and the manicure hutch then 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 what is it a collection 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.859
 who told me about it and it's really great 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 pretty then as his name indicated 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.490
 caviar is very expensive it costs 20 euros 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.439
 it is found in sephora is against the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 rendering is really great so before 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.320
 you talk about it I tested them yesterday 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.700
 evening so here I hope it shows 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 well 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 and what can I tell you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's good that it's a nail polish 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.870
 for some occasions but not at 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 wear every day 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.510
 why because policies bis 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 removes at the level of the perimeters of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.310
 the nail but overall sincerely 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.380
 i slept with i showered g 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.720
 I made food finally I still 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.800
 do a few things on a 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.690
 nail her my outfit 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.190
 now all the hand I do not think 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.970
 it's really really for an event 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.090
 for a night 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.700
 but the rendering finally sincerely I love 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.860
 so I still wanted to show you 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.680
 especially how does it work so we go 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.330
 to do it together is like that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.280
 never one day I did not wish you 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.340
 already know how to use it then I 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.820
 am going to make a small change with the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.940
 camera 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:40.930
 be careful the eyes ok so here 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.970
 normally for you it's good we want 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.200
 just lie to you the time resolution 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.910
 you see ok here we are good then 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.880
 how is it going first of all you 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.360
 make a first layer of pine peeps 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.850
 then the pen pole is that there 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.850
 a first layer you wait for that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 dry and you put the second layer 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:13.480
 so do not be stingy about the dose here 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.370
 they must have it has to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.569
 go very quickly we'll see why 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.360
 right now 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.090
 this is my second layer and party animal 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.910
 who closes the pot is there now we 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 will go to basics 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.430
 ok you take your little pearls and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.440
 you pour it on it so well 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.450
 obviously you take the plastic well 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.240
 1,300 it is sold with so there's no 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.510
 worry we tap a little bit we look 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 if there are everywhere we reverse if 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 missing 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.620
 here we are we are waiting and with the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.450
 finger we press a little bit for good 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.239
 it sticks to the base one at the top 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.060
 coat 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.200
 So here it should be good 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 but for what is gone do not skimp 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.230
 anyway you have a 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.489
 recuperator so it's okay huh 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.129
 you do not say that all those that 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.590
 I landed are lost so me 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:27.920
 I'm very, very, very, I do not like 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:32.870
 count small defects and that's it 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.579
 pats do the edges well then 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.260
 normally exists two meters from the top 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.329
 coat also on the perimeter for good 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 I personally do not care 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.620
 not so I did not put it I thought 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.299
 we will test meaning and it has not served me 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.430
 very much 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.510
 so here and I will show you the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.019
 result so I have trouble staying in 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.569
 the room we will rather zoom 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.400
 that's the end result it's 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.970
 really super nice finally me I 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.829
 found that really really adorable 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.220
 for an evening I think it can 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.410
 to be really great and that's it avoids 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.230
 having to put a lot of 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.299
 full of how to say of two bracelets 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.230
 or something else it really ends up a garment 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.180
 it's really a pretty trend a 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.070
 I really appreciate myself I fell 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.060
 loving 1 and I really thank that 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.640
