what we're calling I think it's right at
the<00:01:57.119> center<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> downtown<00:01:57.800> it's<00:01:58.800> Tom's<00:01:59.369> design

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
the center of downtown it's Tom's design

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.749 
the center of downtown it's Tom's design
and<00:02:00.330> then<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.110> threw<00:02:01.830> down<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.220> concrete

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and then I threw down with the concrete

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
and then I threw down with the concrete
in<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.000> paint<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> glass<00:02:03.690> it's<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> lot<00:02:04.410> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
in the paint of the glass it's a lot of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.419 
in the paint of the glass it's a lot of
open<00:02:04.890> space<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:06.569> a<00:02:06.630> middle<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.200> dmos<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
open space and a middle for dmos and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
open space and a middle for dmos and
things<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.060> which<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.600> really

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
things like that which will be really

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.200 
things like that which will be really
fun<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.100> there's<00:02:11.280> upper-tier<00:02:11.610> kind

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
fun but and then there's upper-tier kind

fun but and then there's upper-tier kind
of<00:02:12.300> parks<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.930> walkways<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> are<00:02:13.590> before

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
of parks and walkways that are before
