00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 so what goes on here is hard and hard 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.839
 welcome to my new 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 video in this video I show 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.799
 you a tip / trick on the map that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.730
 we use this liquid air weapon in miracles 1 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.730
 gets a lot of fun 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 there I am again and that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 what you need for this tip / trick 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.489
 is simply the map directors on 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.239
 february 28 for the playstation 3 player 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.010
 and came out for the pc player 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.650
 Six players were able to spend a month 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 beforehand because they have one 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.879
 month before, get it on everyone 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 that's a pity, that's why I can 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.650
 only now with the tips tricks 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.729
 come and see how you finally see 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.129
 on the feet 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.140
 that is very important in any case 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.589
 you need the 1400 points 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.240
 so that you can open the doors and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.770
 it is definitely much better for that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 if you shoot your legs and yes 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 then one is usual then 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 the round one a little bit longer and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.150
 I'm delaying that here in this one 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 play and then we can do it right here 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.259
 purely in the elevator and immediately he goes so 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 nice down and a tip afterwards 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.380
 you jump so that a bit 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 Going faster is definitely possible 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 Much fast, miracles and jumps here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 Here you can find a few immediately 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 the part is definitely in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.399
 Here you can see the different ones 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.799
 open the door and you immediately do the 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.200
 power on and here you can 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.600
 partner and does the swap trick and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.689
 although you can transfer that and if 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.899
 there are a few here on the elevator 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 her beautiful and another tip here 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.649
 rather it was down to train 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.679
 or upwards because that can sometimes 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.219
 go wrong so after I have a few here 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.210
 day then she goes to this table and 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.429
 build it 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.340
 Here it takes the next part goes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.680
 to the table and builds neither as said 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.790
 the packs are somewhere else times i like it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 here is, for example, the bottle 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.319
 Actually she is sometimes up there too 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.270
 She just became kitchen and now 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.130
 the next part comes next 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.590
 Part is also much owe a floor 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.630
 higher and therefore if you have no points 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.260
 For that you just go here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.420
 remington and would have to wait a bit 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.110
 until the elevator comes down 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.270
 if you have the necessary money so 1000 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.370
 1000 dollars or zombie points or how 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.920
 he also means that you can do that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.880
 Use stairs where you go upstairs 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.030
 can go in front of the table and yes then 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.830
 there comes the part and is definitely 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.190
 really happy glitsch what can I still 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.190
 say yes there is definitely one 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.260
 really cool map people I recommend 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.560
 you only the new maps are definitely 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:12.470
 fall also really cool only 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.780
 recommendable people only the admira is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.360
 not my case but yes 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.360
 everyone's thing and we already 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.860
 the elevator is already in sight 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.670
 come down now you have one more 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.290
 wait a bit 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.660
 and I would rather be with the zombie 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.700
 go back a bit more like me 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.440
 make this the same because if he then 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 come to you then he can tell you all 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.489
 easy killing is right in any case 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.769
 shit if you 've come this far 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.510
 and then in any case strengthens then so 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.250
 we wait here and how you see me 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.230
 I'll log back here with me 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.500
 then you can go there very fast 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.579
 and then you go there and light up 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.220
 look at this 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.780
 where is the zombie I still thought so 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.160
 Okay, so we go then a floor 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.609
 up and then you have to go there 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.660
 jump here is the last part and 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:13.160
 with the last part you can slip 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.989
 Vice build easily and here quite a 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.660
 small tip you can easily follow 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.269
 below and at and acts very fast 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.940
 and go forward with your stick 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.590
 so that now comes next floor that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.640
 I've often helped to survive 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.190
 and to build the slate pc faster and 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.139
 Here he is finished in four minutes 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.090
 People, of course I hope that again 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.490
