lot<00:02:10.110> um

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
lot um

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.990 
lot um
and<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.710> just<00:02:12.220> works<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.610> know<00:02:12.670> there's<00:02:12.910> going

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and it just works I know there's going

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.360 
and it just works I know there's going
to<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.120> some<00:02:13.420> controversy<00:02:14.110> at<00:02:14.200> first<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.160> I'm

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
to be some controversy at first but I'm

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.850 
to be some controversy at first but I'm
sure<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.850> people<00:02:16.230> who<00:02:17.230> will<00:02:17.380> enjoy<00:02:17.650> this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
sure a lot of people who will enjoy this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.510 
sure a lot of people who will enjoy this
and<00:02:18.130> they<00:02:18.280> will<00:02:19.020> finally<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:21.070> come<00:02:21.370> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
and they will finally like come to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.020 
and they will finally like come to
accept<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:22.030> over<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:23.110> time<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.670> think

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
accept it over the over time and I think

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
accept it over the over time and I think
they'll<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.600> over<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.080> long<00:02:26.230> term<00:02:26.260> short

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
they'll like it over the long term short

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.050 
they'll like it over the long term short
term<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.040> might<00:02:27.160> cause<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> little<00:02:27.460> problem<00:02:27.910> but

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
term it might cause a little problem but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.630 
term it might cause a little problem but
long<00:02:28.240> term<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.600> think<00:02:28.630> they'll<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
long term I think they'll like it and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.740 
long term I think they'll like it and
