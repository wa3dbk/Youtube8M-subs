00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
iphone which for all intensive purposes

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.670 
iphone which for all intensive purposes
is<00:00:41.010> garbage<00:00:41.840> this<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.080> be<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:43.530> better

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is garbage this should be a lot better
