the three-octave - kale so this is a

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.730 
the three-octave - kale so this is a
long<00:00:11.120> scale<00:00:11.629> as<00:00:11.900> opposed<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:12.289> scales<00:00:12.590> that

long scale as opposed to scales that
travel<00:00:13.070> across<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:13.820> neck<00:00:14.000> like<00:00:14.330> this<00:00:14.540> in

now you notice I've left each of these

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
now you notice I've left each of these
fingers<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.750> when<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> place<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
fingers down when I place them on the

fingers down when I place them on the
fret<00:01:44.040> board<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.299> important<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
fret board that's very important for the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
fret board that's very important for the
gato<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.040> doing<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.460> we're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
gato because what we're doing is we're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.820 
gato because what we're doing is we're
saying<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> wanted<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.320> backwards

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
saying that if I wanted to go backwards

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.710 
saying that if I wanted to go backwards
all<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> pull<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> finger<00:01:51.600> off

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
all I have to do is pull a finger off

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
all I have to do is pull a finger off
and<00:01:51.930> I've<00:01:51.990> gone<00:01:52.140> backwards<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and I've gone backwards if you if you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
and I've gone backwards if you if you
place<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.330> finger<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:54.869> lift<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> up

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
place your finger and then lift it up

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190 
place your finger and then lift it up
like<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:57.000> failing<00:01:57.330> painlessly

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
like this you're failing painlessly

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
like this you're failing painlessly
because<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.190> put<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.490> back<00:01:59.580> on

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because you have to put them back on

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
because you have to put them back on
again<00:01:59.789> before<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.539> put<00:02:00.750> off<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.530> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
again before you put off and that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
again before you put off and that's
movement<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.670> times<00:02:03.240> money<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
movement and that's time times money to

it's the majority bits just gonna be

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.590 
it's the majority bits just gonna be
alternate<00:02:53.730> until<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.330> certain

the<00:04:14.070> B<00:04:14.220> string<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.180> going<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.360> go<00:04:16.489> B

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the B string so we're going to go B

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.820 
the B string so we're going to go B
string<00:04:17.850> 12th<00:04:18.330> rat<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.260> play<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
string 12th rat and here we play the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.210 
string 12th rat and here we play the
minor<00:04:19.980> shape<00:04:20.280> again<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:20.790> 12<00:04:22.400> 13<00:04:23.540> 15<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:26.130> then

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
minor shape again so 12 13 15 and then

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.900 
minor shape again so 12 13 15 and then
apply<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.790> e<00:04:26.820> string<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.360> 12<00:04:27.950> 13<00:04:28.950> 15

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
apply that to the e string so 12 13 15

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.970 
apply that to the e string so 12 13 15
and<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:31.620> finish<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.070> slide<00:04:32.550> time<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.770> in

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
and to finish it slide time so in

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.850 
and to finish it slide time so in
summation<00:04:35.340> what<00:04:36.060> we<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:37.140> slight<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
summation what we have is a slight a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.400 
summation what we have is a slight a
minor<00:04:38.610> shape<00:04:38.850> for<00:04:39.210> minor<00:04:39.360> shape<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.810> slide<00:04:40.140> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
shape a minor shape and it's like so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.950 
shape a minor shape and it's like so
there's<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.840> pattern<00:04:46.080> here<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.570> once<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.750> spot

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
there's a pattern here and once you spot

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.700 
there's a pattern here and once you spot
a<00:04:49.020> pattern

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
a pattern

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.010 
a pattern
they're<00:04:49.890> great<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.160> exploit<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:51.120> make<00:04:51.300> musical

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
they're great to exploit to make musical

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.590 
they're great to exploit to make musical
and<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.400> something<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:54.000> liking<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.480> do

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
and this is something I'm liking to do

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360 
and this is something I'm liking to do
all<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> time<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.650> here's<00:04:56.010> how<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.250> whole

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
all the time so here's how the whole

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.890 
all the time so here's how the whole
scale<00:04:56.730> sounds<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.330> I'm<00:04:57.420> going<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.630> give<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.840> a

referred<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.520> as<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:44.940> Aeolian<00:05:45.660> mode<00:05:46.460> which<00:05:47.460> is

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
referred to as the Aeolian mode which is

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.580 
referred to as the Aeolian mode which is
what<00:05:47.669> we<00:05:47.760> call<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:48.840> here's<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.050> close-up<00:05:49.290> for

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
what we call it so here's a close-up for

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.879 
what we call it so here's a close-up for
you<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:51.240> starting<00:05:51.750> with<00:05:51.900> my<00:05:52.110> first<00:05:52.410> finger<00:05:52.680> all

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
you so starting with my first finger all

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.470 
you so starting with my first finger all
the<00:05:52.980> a<00:05:53.010> note<00:05:53.340> which<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.820> fifth<00:05:54.030> fret<00:05:54.270> E

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
the a note which is the fifth fret E

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.740 
the a note which is the fifth fret E
string<00:05:54.570> I'm<00:05:55.050> going<00:05:55.200> to<00:05:55.260> scale<00:05:55.530> nice<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.310> slow

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
string I'm going to scale nice and slow

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:37.100 
string I'm going to scale nice and slow
three<00:05:57.750> octave

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.480 

so<00:06:38.110> there's<00:06:38.350> one<00:06:38.590> area<00:06:38.920> within<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.250> scale

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
so there's one area within the scale

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.730 
so there's one area within the scale
where<00:06:40.300> your<00:06:40.600> alternate<00:06:41.170> picking<00:06:41.350> will<00:06:41.590> have

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
where your alternate picking will have

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.340 
where your alternate picking will have
to<00:06:41.860> become<00:06:42.010> economy<00:06:42.790> picking<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.870> maintain

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
to become economy picking to maintain

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.560 
to become economy picking to maintain
the<00:06:44.530> flow<00:06:44.830> so<00:06:45.580> that<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.760> don't<00:06:45.940> jump<00:06:46.150> over<00:06:46.540> a

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
the flow so that you don't jump over a

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.810 
the flow so that you don't jump over a
string<00:06:46.930> to<00:06:47.230> pick<00:06:47.440> up<00:06:47.590> or<00:06:47.800> jump<00:06:48.040> above<00:06:48.520> a<00:06:48.580> string

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
string to pick up or jump above a string

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.480 
string to pick up or jump above a string
to<00:06:48.910> dig<00:06:49.060> down<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:50.350> it's<00:06:50.830> kind<00:06:51.220> of<00:06:51.250> the<00:06:51.340> middle

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
to dig down and it's kind of the middle

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.830 
to dig down and it's kind of the middle
section<00:06:51.730> I'll<00:06:52.240> talk<00:06:52.480> you<00:06:52.510> through<00:06:52.660> the

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
section I'll talk you through the

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:04.040 
section I'll talk you through the
picking<00:06:53.110> as<00:06:53.200> I've<00:06:53.350> scaled<00:06:53.650> so<00:06:53.890> we've<00:06:54.010> got<00:06:54.100> down

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.390 

down<00:07:05.070> down

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
down down

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.510 
down down
so<00:07:07.210> one<00:07:07.360> 12th<00:07:07.990> fret<00:07:08.320> D<00:07:08.860> string<00:07:08.890> with<00:07:09.280> my<00:07:09.310> little

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
so one 12th fret D string with my little

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.390 
so one 12th fret D string with my little
finger<00:07:09.970> I<00:07:10.150> picked<00:07:11.140> down<00:07:11.440> I'm<00:07:11.890> going<00:07:12.160> down<00:07:12.250> a

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
finger I picked down I'm going down a

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.950 
finger I picked down I'm going down a
string<00:07:12.700> anyway<00:07:13.000> so<00:07:13.060> I'll<00:07:13.360> pick<00:07:13.480> down<00:07:13.630> again

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
string anyway so I'll pick down again

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.150 
string anyway so I'll pick down again
just<00:07:14.260> make<00:07:15.250> sense<00:07:15.490> when<00:07:15.970> I<00:07:16.030> go<00:07:16.150> up<00:07:16.620> down<00:07:18.360> down

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
just make sense when I go up down down

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.370 
just make sense when I go up down down
down<00:07:21.190> that's<00:07:21.670> the<00:07:21.790> 15th<00:07:22.240> fret<00:07:22.480> B<00:07:22.870> string<00:07:22.900> and

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
down that's the 15th fret B string and

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.320 
down that's the 15th fret B string and
then<00:07:23.470> backfilled<00:07:23.890> down<00:07:24.160> again<00:07:24.550> the<00:07:24.760> E<00:07:24.910> string

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
then backfilled down again the E string

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.710 
then backfilled down again the E string
12<00:07:25.740> so<00:07:26.740> the<00:07:26.890> idea<00:07:27.190> is<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:27.460> just<00:07:27.730> avoids<00:07:28.120> picking

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
12 so the idea is it just avoids picking

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.530 
12 so the idea is it just avoids picking
down<00:07:28.960> going<00:07:29.800> down<00:07:30.100> and<00:07:30.640> over<00:07:31.090> a<00:07:31.120> string<00:07:31.420> to

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:31.540 
down going down and over a string to

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.990 
down going down and over a string to
pick<00:07:31.690> up<00:07:31.980> that's<00:07:32.980> a<00:07:33.250> waste<00:07:33.460> of<00:07:33.640> time<00:07:33.820> and

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 
pick up that's a waste of time and

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.210 
pick up that's a waste of time and
movement<00:07:34.360> so<00:07:34.990> the<00:07:35.170> two<00:07:35.350> economy<00:07:36.010> picked

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.220 
movement so the two economy picked

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.070 
movement so the two economy picked
places<00:07:36.670> are<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:36.850> 12th<00:07:37.210> fret<00:07:37.360> D<00:07:37.630> string<00:07:37.660> where

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 
places are the 12th fret D string where

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.200 
places are the 12th fret D string where
you<00:07:38.170> pick<00:07:38.350> down<00:07:38.560> go<00:07:39.370> down<00:07:39.400> a<00:07:39.580> string<00:07:39.850> to<00:07:39.940> the<00:07:40.030> g

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.210 
you pick down go down a string to the g

00:07:40.210 --> 00:08:10.360 
you pick down go down a string to the g
string<00:07:40.510> and<00:07:40.800> the<00:07:41.800> 15th<00:07:42.190> fret<00:07:42.400> B

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.370 

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.430
