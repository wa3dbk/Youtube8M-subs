now<00:00:00.630> let<00:00:01.050> us<00:00:01.079> look<00:00:01.350> at<00:00:01.500> how<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.709> create<00:00:01.949> simple

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
now let us look at how to create simple

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.430 
now let us look at how to create simple
objects<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.629> Houdini<00:00:03.899> interface

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
objects here in the Houdini interface

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.039 
objects here in the Houdini interface
the<00:00:05.310> most<00:00:05.549> easiest<00:00:06.060> way<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.299> create<00:00:06.750> an<00:00:06.899> object

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the most easiest way to create an object

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.530 
the most easiest way to create an object
in<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.649> interface<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.940> create<00:00:09.269> tab

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
in the interface is on the create tab

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.530 
in the interface is on the create tab
here<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.080> top<00:00:10.670> by<00:00:11.670> clicking<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.150> any<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the objects here in the create tab I get

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.450 
the objects here in the create tab I get
a<00:00:14.880> bounding<00:00:15.450> box<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> 3d<00:00:16.529> view<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:17.220> lets

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a bounding box in the 3d view which lets

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.189 
a bounding box in the 3d view which lets
me<00:00:17.550> position<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.150> particular<00:00:18.660> object

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199

construction plane when I am clicking on
any<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> objects<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
any of the objects here you can see that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
any of the objects here you can see that
I<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.960> bounding<00:01:22.470> box<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:22.920> represents

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I get a bounding box which represents

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
I get a bounding box which represents
where<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> object<00:01:24.540> gets<00:01:24.689> created<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.920> hold

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
where the object gets created if I hold

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
where the object gets created if I hold
Shift<00:01:26.490> key<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.030> keyboard<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.750> move<00:01:27.990> my

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
Shift key on my keyboard and move my

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
Shift key on my keyboard and move my
mouse<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> object<00:01:29.610> gets

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
mouse you can see the object gets

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
mouse you can see the object gets
displaced<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> construction<00:01:31.590> plane

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
displaced from the construction plane

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
displaced from the construction plane
and<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.790> I'm<00:01:33.060> offsetting<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> object<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and now I'm offsetting the object and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
and now I'm offsetting the object and
still<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> place<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.490> wherever<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
still get to place it wherever I want in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
still get to place it wherever I want in
the<00:01:36.900> scene<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the scene but this time I get to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
the scene but this time I get to
position<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> exact<00:01:39.990> three<00:01:40.229> dimensions

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
position it in exact three dimensions

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
position it in exact three dimensions
rather<00:01:41.400> than<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> construction

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
rather than only on the construction

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.210 
rather than only on the construction
plane<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:45.090> finally<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> 3d<00:01:46.350> view<00:01:46.590> let's

not an object is actually visible so if

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.039 
not an object is actually visible so if
I<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.549> ahead<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:56.970> zoom<00:03:57.180> into<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.599> viewport

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
I go ahead and zoom into the viewport

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.289 
I go ahead and zoom into the viewport
and<00:03:58.200> disable<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:58.980> blue<00:03:59.489> flag<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.000> see

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
and disable this blue flag you can see

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.659 
and disable this blue flag you can see
the<00:04:00.450> object<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.989> no<00:04:01.230> longer<00:04:01.590> visible<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.519> it

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
the object is no longer visible but it

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.460 
the object is no longer visible but it
can<00:04:02.880> still<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.209> manipulated<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.349> I've<00:04:04.440> just

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
can still be manipulated so I've just

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.830 
can still be manipulated so I've just
moved<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.130> box<00:04:05.340> while<00:04:05.639> it<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.120> invisible<00:04:06.480> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
moved the box while it was invisible and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.809 
moved the box while it was invisible and
if<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.290> enable<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.829> view<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.400> see<00:04:08.609> it's

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
if I enable the view you can see it's

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.409 
if I enable the view you can see it's
displaced<00:04:09.560> also<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.769> another<00:04:11.220> way<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.090> tell

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
displaced also in another way if I tell

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.539 
displaced also in another way if I tell
that<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.930> object<00:04:13.319> is<00:04:13.440> no<00:04:13.650> longer<00:04:13.889> selectable

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
that the object is no longer selectable

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.659 
that the object is no longer selectable
I<00:04:15.109> can<00:04:16.109> no<00:04:16.260> longer<00:04:16.289> select<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.010> object<00:04:17.400> here

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
I can no longer select the object here

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.849 
I can no longer select the object here
in<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.060> 3d<00:04:18.389> view<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:19.079> observe<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.590> let<00:04:19.829> me

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
in the 3d view to observe this let me

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.039 
in the 3d view to observe this let me
create<00:04:20.130> another<00:04:20.549> primitive<00:04:20.789> I'll<00:04:21.239> just

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
create another primitive I'll just

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.290 
create another primitive I'll just
create<00:04:22.289> a<00:04:22.380> spear<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:23.400> if<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.550> go<00:04:23.729> ahead<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.090> try

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
create a spear now if I go ahead and try

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.089 
create a spear now if I go ahead and try
to<00:04:24.360> select<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.900> cube<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.590> can<00:04:25.740> see<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.070> I

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
to select the cube you can see that I

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.260 
to select the cube you can see that I
can<00:04:26.280> no<00:04:26.460> longer<00:04:26.490> do

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
can no longer do

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.360 
can no longer do
so<00:04:27.419> but<00:04:28.020> by<00:04:28.199> clicking<00:04:28.259> on<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.830> box<00:04:29.069> object

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so but by clicking on the box object

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.390 
so but by clicking on the box object
here<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.509> easily<00:04:30.720> select<00:04:31.349> it<00:04:31.500> whereas<00:04:32.129> by

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
here I can easily select it whereas by

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.249 
here I can easily select it whereas by
clicking<00:04:32.729> on<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:32.970> spear<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.479> can<00:04:33.780> select<00:04:34.139> that

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
clicking on the spear I can select that

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.980 
clicking on the spear I can select that
so<00:04:35.009> this<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.879> selection<00:04:36.240> handle<00:04:36.720> which

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
so this is a selection handle which

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.499 
so this is a selection handle which
tells<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:37.620> object<00:04:38.009> is<00:04:38.129> templated<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:38.970> this

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
tells the object is templated and this

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.480 
tells the object is templated and this
is<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.080> display<00:04:40.530> flag<00:04:40.800> which<00:04:41.069> tells<00:04:41.340> whether

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
is the display flag which tells whether

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.740 
is the display flag which tells whether
if<00:04:41.669> an<00:04:41.789> object<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.360> hidden<00:04:43.879> so<00:04:44.879> that<00:04:45.240> brings<00:04:45.509> us

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
if an object is hidden so that brings us

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.350 
if an object is hidden so that brings us
to<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.020> end<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.349> this<00:04:46.530> particular<00:04:46.800> video<00:04:47.370> here
