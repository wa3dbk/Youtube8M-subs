00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello and welcome to ugly 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.530
 culture my name is ann christin me 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.059
 I'm 25 years old in 2013 I mean mine 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.590
 graduation to the farmer made and 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 parallel to this the economist for 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.420
 farming together with my family 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 economically a biobetrieb we 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.170
 have two mobiles in the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.270
 be kept and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.130
 cows of the breed limousin the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.559
 get to see in another video 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.270
 and today I show you like the stall 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.430
 is constructed and how the everyday 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.110
 work out so see how you see 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.899
 Here is the mobile stall 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.519
 he is fully mobile that is us 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 You can continue driving as you do 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.159
 behind the wheels can see 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.979
 and currently in the wiener here 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:53.979
 Fenced every chicken has at least 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.649
 eight square meters available and all 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.699
 14 days the chickens are driven on 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.109
 that means they stay in the barn 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.639
 and in the morning we drive the steel 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.650
 Continue and then when we fence again 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.290
 will have built again 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.280
 let out 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.159
 Now I'll show you down here 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.710
 we have the so-called culture space 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.610
 He is always with straw and wood shavings 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 interspersed 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.020
 there the chickens lie in front of everything 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 summer also very good heat now 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.520
 was because the air starts to refuel 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.659
 and now let's go to the stone 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.030
 the right side we have limited 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.719
 that 's a storage bin going 500 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 liter pure 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.070
 It will be every seven to ten days 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:48.700
 filled up and here can the chickens 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:51.969
 lincoln left side we have the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.929
 feeding troughs and four pieces 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.929
 with us every day to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.130
 how much eat but better 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.180
 Overview of you the weather sometimes 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:16.340
 The animals get corn wheat 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.930
 triticale peas schroth sesame short 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.250
 to eat sunflowers 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.870
 that is you then so called mail 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.000
 and in our own cultivation we have wheat 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.940
 and the grains I get quite open 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.730
 here are the perches where the chickens 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.980
 long night sitting on and is here 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.830
 because of its grid around it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.220
 is the code found that will be one 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.110
 Twice as much as twice a week and you 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.430
 we have the so-called misfortune 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.650
 cold foam room I just ever 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.940
 showed the chickens over there 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:00.350
 go down the stairs so now 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.940
 I show you just like that with 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.680
 the webbing works that i have 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.060
 just shown 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.269
 as I said once or twice a week 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.189
 the cult band will be listed 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.140
 here's a curve that's on it 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.950
 stuck and the best of a hand 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.239
 be operated 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.209
 Zakopane with a shovel from 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.030
 front loader of tractor goes down and 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.370
 then the whole turned and the mist 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.849
 then falls in principle in the shovel 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.950
 purely 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.359
 Now I'll show you one of the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.650
 everyday work and that is the 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.000
 to collect the eggs 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.639
 we have here of these blasphemies 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.530
 interspersed with spelled, game 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.430
 that the eggs keep falling in and out 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.810
 do not break 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.980
 Among other things, things can also be 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:57.590
 we build a nest so to speak 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:04:01.849
 so that here is for example one 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.370
 so called clubs we try the 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.180
 hatch eggs 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.159
 that's an instinct from the hat 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:16.780
 but unfortunately I have to go now 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:17.709
 Take it away because I sell it that way 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.970
 nest is empty now 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.979
 I'm going to the other yet 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.360
 collect and if you liked it 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.990
 then turn on next time too 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 again 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.430
 the next time I show you how the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.199
 Resistance is put forward as we are 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 then continue and from the 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.199
 mother cows, I will give you also what 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.759
 demonstrate 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.060
 and yes, I 'm looking forward to the next one 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.060
 let's shoot
