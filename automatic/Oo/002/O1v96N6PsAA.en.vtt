in the well fun so what do you think are

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.520 
in the well fun so what do you think are
you<00:03:51.390> know<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:52.020> with<00:03:52.200> some<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you know look with some of the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.320 
you know look with some of the
advantages<00:03:52.830> of<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> Acrobat<00:03:53.610> class<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.120> terms

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
advantages of the Acrobat class in terms

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.090 
advantages of the Acrobat class in terms
of<00:03:54.480> time<00:03:54.810> going<00:03:54.960> up<00:03:55.140> against<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.470> brawler<00:03:55.740> or<00:03:56.070> a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
of time going up against a brawler or a

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.500 
of time going up against a brawler or a
big<00:03:56.340> man<00:03:56.520> what<00:03:56.730> are<00:03:56.760> what<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.150> some<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
big man what are what are some of the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.080 
big man what are what are some of the
advantages<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.800> have<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.280> think<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
advantages that I have I think the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.300 
advantages that I have I think the
biggest<00:04:00.240> advantage<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.140> not<00:04:01.950> having

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
biggest advantage you have is not having

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
biggest advantage you have is not having
to<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.550> directly<00:04:02.910> in<00:04:03.120> their<00:04:03.240> face<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.720> hurt

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
to get directly in their face to hurt

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.440 
to get directly in their face to hurt
them<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:05.340> last<00:04:05.550> thing<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.850> want<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.150> doing

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
them the last thing you want to be doing

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.810 
them the last thing you want to be doing
is<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:06.959> standing<00:04:07.560> there<00:04:07.590> when<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.070> grappler

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
is just standing there when a grappler

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.330 
is just standing there when a grappler
or<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> brawler<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.170> doing<00:04:10.650> their<00:04:10.770> close<00:04:11.070> range

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340

we've<00:04:46.010> seen<00:04:46.190> okay<00:04:47.150> what<00:04:47.330> we're<00:04:47.480> seeing<00:04:47.630> here

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
we've seen okay what we're seeing here

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.290 
we've seen okay what we're seeing here
is<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.320> have<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.500> more<00:04:49.160> stage<00:04:49.460> health<00:04:49.820> bar<00:04:50.030> here

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
is we have a more stage health bar here

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.880 
is we have a more stage health bar here
that's<00:04:50.540> another<00:04:50.720> thing<00:04:50.960> we're<00:04:51.470> doing<00:04:51.500> here

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
that's another thing we're doing here

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.010 
that's another thing we're doing here
which<00:04:51.980> is<00:04:52.130> maybe<00:04:52.280> more<00:04:52.400> of<00:04:52.610> an<00:04:52.700> independent<00:04:53.270> is

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
which is maybe more of an independent is

knows<00:05:03.830> hey<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.700> good<00:05:05.120> visual<00:05:05.300> indicator

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
knows hey it's a good visual indicator

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.140 
knows hey it's a good visual indicator
of<00:05:05.900> progress<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.590> beo<00:05:07.160> we<00:05:07.520> did<00:05:07.640> it<00:05:07.730> all<00:05:07.850> enough

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
of progress and beo we did it all enough

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.750 
of progress and beo we did it all enough
one<00:05:08.990> bar<00:05:09.230> then<00:05:09.530> every<00:05:10.070> hit<00:05:10.220> would<00:05:10.370> only<00:05:10.550> do<00:05:10.730> a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
one bar then every hit would only do a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.850 
one bar then every hit would only do a
few<00:05:10.880> pixels<00:05:11.570> advantage<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.410> would<00:05:12.590> kind<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
few pixels advantage that would kind of

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.250 
few pixels advantage that would kind of
look<00:05:12.980> boring<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.700> looks<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.300> HBK<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:15.050> he's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
look boring so looks like HBK is he's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.659 
look boring so looks like HBK is he's
got<00:05:15.410> three<00:05:15.710> stars<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:16.220> means<00:05:16.400> he's<00:05:16.490> ready

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
got three stars that means he's ready

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.940

that<00:05:20.450> star<00:05:20.810> system<00:05:21.200> right<00:05:21.380> there<00:05:21.590> is

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
that star system right there is

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.680 
that star system right there is
