00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
incredible and but basically with roses

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
incredible and but basically with roses
you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> keep<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.950> somewhat<00:00:38.340> compact

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you want to keep them somewhat compact

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
you want to keep them somewhat compact
and<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> remove<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> dead<00:00:40.350> flowers

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and you want to remove the dead flowers

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.110 
and you want to remove the dead flowers
because<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> don't<00:00:41.610> remove<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> dead

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
because if you don't remove the dead

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.200 
because if you don't remove the dead
flowers<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> plant<00:00:44.090> concentrates<00:00:45.090> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
flowers then the plant concentrates this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
flowers then the plant concentrates this
effort<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.629> making<00:00:45.809> seeds<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.430> want<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
effort on making seeds and you want that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
effort on making seeds and you want that
energy<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.539> into<00:00:48.780> making<00:00:48.960> new<00:00:49.200> flower<00:00:49.440> buds

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
energy to go into making new flower buds

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.850 
energy to go into making new flower buds
so<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> cut<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> old<00:00:50.820> flower<00:00:51.000> buds

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
so if you cut off the old flower buds

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
so if you cut off the old flower buds
then<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.309> plants<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> spend<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.270> all

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
then the plants going to spend all all

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.389 
then the plants going to spend all all
this<00:00:54.989> energy<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> producing<00:00:55.980> new<00:00:56.129> flower

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this energy and producing new flower

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
this energy and producing new flower
buds<00:00:56.730> throughout<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> summer<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.320> I'm

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
buds throughout the summer and and I'm

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.689 
buds throughout the summer and and I'm
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> show<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> bigger<00:00:59.340> plant

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to show you on the bigger plant

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
going to show you on the bigger plant
how<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.960> such<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.559> because

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
how to do that in such a way because

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
how to do that in such a way because
it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.579> demonstration<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.780> I'm

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it's a better demonstration but here I'm

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
it's a better demonstration but here I'm
just<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> spent<00:01:04.979> flower<00:01:05.250> I'm

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
just because there's a spent flower I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.780 
just because there's a spent flower I'm
just<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> take<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.540> throw<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> away

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
just going to take it off throw it away

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.109 
just going to take it off throw it away
but<00:01:08.790> roses<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:11.310> finicky<00:01:11.790> than

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
but roses are a little more finicky than

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
but roses are a little more finicky than
a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.390> other<00:01:12.510> plants<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.080> landscape<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
a lot other plants in your landscape and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
a lot other plants in your landscape and
they<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> insects<00:01:15.869> Japanese

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
they can get the insects Japanese

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.749 
they can get the insects Japanese
beetles<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.250> variety<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> other

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
beetles and then a variety of other

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
beetles and then a variety of other
things<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> chew<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> leaves<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
things like to chew on the leaves and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
things like to chew on the leaves and
when<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.520> eat<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> leaves<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.210> off<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
when to eat the leaves all off then the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.530 
when to eat the leaves all off then the
plant<00:01:21.960> doesn't<00:01:22.290> produce<00:01:22.590> properly<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.540> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
plant doesn't produce properly and you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
plant doesn't produce properly and you
know<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.380> course<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.650> also<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:26.100> some

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
know they of course they also need some

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.410 
know they of course they also need some
some<00:01:26.780> fertilizer<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:28.140> food<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.619> order<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
some fertilizer some food in order to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.789 
some fertilizer some food in order to
produce<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> continue

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
produce the right you know to continue

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
produce the right you know to continue
to<00:01:31.920> prove<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.280> producing<00:01:32.729> flowers<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.299> year

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to prove some producing flowers all year

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
to prove some producing flowers all year
long<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.610> roses<00:01:35.610> tend<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.150> some

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
long and roses tend to get some

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
long and roses tend to get some
different<00:01:36.689> fungus<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> stuff<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> leaves

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
different fungus and stuff on the leaves

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.060 
different fungus and stuff on the leaves
that<00:01:38.520> again<00:01:39.329> make<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.020> difficult<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.829> them<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that again make it difficult for them to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.580 
that again make it difficult for them to
perform<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> things<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
perform so one of the things that I that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
perform so one of the things that I that
I<00:01:43.619> use<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.369> simple<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.390> called

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I use is very simple this is called

first<00:03:25.350> put<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.739> long<00:03:26.069> shoot<00:03:26.400> than<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> flower

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
first put on a long shoot than a flower

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.210 
first put on a long shoot than a flower
bud<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.230> start<00:03:28.500> below<00:03:28.950> where

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
bud and it's going to start below where

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.430 
bud and it's going to start below where
I<00:03:29.250> made<00:03:29.549> my<00:03:29.579> cut<00:03:30.030> now<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.870> don't<00:03:31.200> know<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.380> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
I made my cut now I don't know if you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.670 
I made my cut now I don't know if you
can<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.190> made<00:03:32.459> my<00:03:32.639> cut<00:03:32.970> right<00:03:33.900> let

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
can see that but I made my cut right let

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.330 
can see that but I made my cut right let
me<00:03:34.739> pull<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.130> away<00:03:35.430> right<00:03:36.500> above<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:37.950> this

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
me pull this away right above where this

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
me pull this away right above where this
little<00:03:38.639> branch<00:03:38.880> break<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.480> because<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.410> you

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
little branch break is because if you

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.039 
little branch break is because if you
leave<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.829> stem<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.430> long<00:03:41.760> that's<00:03:42.750> going<00:03:42.989> to

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
leave a stem this long that's going to

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.690 
leave a stem this long that's going to
die<00:03:43.260> back<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.920> then<00:03:44.010> you've<00:03:44.160> got<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> dead

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
die back and then you've got that dead

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
die back and then you've got that dead
ugly<00:03:44.850> tip<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.389> there<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.959> actually<00:03:46.139> you

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
ugly tip in there and I can actually you

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.430 
ugly tip in there and I can actually you
know<00:03:46.680> attract<00:03:47.549> disease<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.720> insect<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.290> so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
know attract disease and insect and so

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.500 
know attract disease and insect and so
on<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.489> anyway<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:51.030> want<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.299> cut

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
on so but anyway so you want to cut

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.360 
on so but anyway so you want to cut
right<00:03:51.540> above<00:03:52.079> where<00:03:52.410> there's<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:52.920> leaf<00:03:53.130> break

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
right above where there's a leaf break

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.720 
right above where there's a leaf break
so<00:03:53.549> you

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
so you

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.879 
so you
I<00:03:53.880> cut<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.329> there<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.900> could<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.739> as

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
I cut it there I could have just as

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.410 
I cut it there I could have just as
easily<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.489> probably<00:03:56.790> would<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.060> cut<00:03:57.299> it

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
easily and probably would have cut it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.379 
easily and probably would have cut it
there<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.620> now<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.609> going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> produce<00:03:59.970> more

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
there and now it's going to produce more

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.900 
there and now it's going to produce more
blooms<00:04:00.720> there<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.489> that's<00:04:02.489> very<00:04:02.700> very

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
blooms there so that's very very

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.780 
blooms there so that's very very
important<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.560> see<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:05.250> plant<00:04:05.579> was

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
important as you can see this plant was

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.330 
important as you can see this plant was
pruned<00:04:06.150> right<00:04:06.420> here<00:04:06.840> some<00:04:07.139> time<00:04:07.380> ago<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.920> it

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
pruned right here some time ago and it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.890 
pruned right here some time ago and it
put<00:04:08.519> on<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.639> new<00:04:08.849> branch<00:04:09.150> here<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:09.870> that

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
put on a new branch here and all that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.580 
put on a new branch here and all that
all<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.709> rose<00:04:11.160> was<00:04:11.639> put<00:04:11.849> on<00:04:11.970> top<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.870> again

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
all that rose was put on top so again

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.949 
all that rose was put on top so again
don't<00:04:13.859> be<00:04:13.950> afraid<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.489> cut<00:04:14.700> them<00:04:14.819> down<00:04:14.970> low<00:04:15.299> so

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
don't be afraid to cut them down low so

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.599 
don't be afraid to cut them down low so
you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.320> keep<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.680> plant<00:04:16.950> nice<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.430> tight

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you can keep the plant nice and tight

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.870 
you can keep the plant nice and tight
and<00:04:17.789> compact<00:04:18.950> but<00:04:19.950> basically<00:04:20.549> don't<00:04:20.789> be

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and compact but basically don't be

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.310 
and compact but basically don't be
afraid<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.269> cut<00:04:21.450> them<00:04:21.570> come<00:04:21.780> all<00:04:22.079> throughout

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
afraid to cut them come all throughout

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.960 
afraid to cut them come all throughout
the<00:04:22.500> growing<00:04:22.680> season<00:04:22.800> every<00:04:23.400> time<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.760> see<00:04:23.940> a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
the growing season every time you see a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.510 
the growing season every time you see a
spent<00:04:24.330> flower<00:04:24.599> on<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:25.349> done<00:04:25.830> cut<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
spent flower on there that's done cut it

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.620 
spent flower on there that's done cut it
off<00:04:26.669> but<00:04:26.970> cut<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.270> down

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
off but cut it down

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.660 
off but cut it down
lower<00:04:27.750> right<00:04:28.080> above<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.380> branch<00:04:28.950> break<00:04:29.130> then

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
lower right above a branch break then

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.420 
lower right above a branch break then
come<00:04:29.700> wintertime<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.410> fall<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:32.160> want<00:04:32.280> to

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
come wintertime in the fall you want to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.670 
come wintertime in the fall you want to
go<00:04:32.520> out<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:33.030> really<00:04:33.540> tighten<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.990> plant<00:04:34.290> up<00:04:34.500> I

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
go out and really tighten the plant up I

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.440 
go out and really tighten the plant up I
mean<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.860> would<00:04:35.160> cut<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.550> about<00:04:36.000> like<00:04:36.210> this

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
mean I would cut it just about like this

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.360 
mean I would cut it just about like this
get<00:04:37.170> behind<00:04:37.320> here<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.800> would<00:04:38.070> cut<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.340> just

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
get behind here I would cut it just

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.950 
get behind here I would cut it just
about<00:04:38.880> like<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.300> where<00:04:39.570> I'm<00:04:39.630> making<00:04:39.720> this

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
about like this where I'm making this

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470 
about like this where I'm making this
arc<00:04:40.170> with<00:04:40.320> my<00:04:40.470> shears<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.270> then<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.420> the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
arc with my shears and then in the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.850 
arc with my shears and then in the
spring<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:42.990> going<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.170> flush<00:04:43.350> out<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> lot<00:04:43.830> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
spring it's going to flush out a lot of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.280 
spring it's going to flush out a lot of
new<00:04:44.070> growth<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.640> start<00:04:45.480> making<00:04:45.750> flowers<00:04:46.170> and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
new growth and start making flowers and

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.510 
new growth and start making flowers and
then<00:04:46.380> throughout<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.680> season<00:04:47.190> you're<00:04:47.370> going

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
then throughout the season you're going

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.340 
then throughout the season you're going
to<00:04:47.580> you're<00:04:47.790> going<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:48.030> cut<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.450> same<00:04:49.170> thing

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
to you're going to cut it same thing

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.690 
to you're going to cut it same thing
with<00:04:49.470> these<00:04:49.530> miniature<00:04:49.950> roses<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:50.370> soon<00:04:50.610> as

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
with these miniature roses as soon as

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.880 
with these miniature roses as soon as
they<00:04:50.820> make<00:04:51.000> our<00:04:51.210> bloom<00:04:51.480> cut<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.500> back<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.740> little

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
they make our bloom cut it back a little

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.590 
they make our bloom cut it back a little
ways<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.490> they<00:04:53.640> too<00:04:53.700> will<00:04:54.060> put<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.390> long

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
ways and they too will put on long

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.080 
ways and they too will put on long
shoots<00:04:54.960> these<00:04:55.770> things<00:04:56.070> bloom<00:04:56.250> like<00:04:56.400> crazy<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
shoots these things bloom like crazy and

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.910 
shoots these things bloom like crazy and
they<00:04:57.210> really<00:04:57.630> start<00:04:57.900> blooming<00:04:58.110> like<00:04:58.530> crazy<00:04:58.770> in
