um<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.640> toxic<00:01:48.000> dam<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.420> take<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
um the toxic dam is gonna take that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
um the toxic dam is gonna take that
right<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.110> away<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.350> him<00:01:49.649> though<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> I'm

she<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.590> goes<00:02:10.740> for<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.980> surf<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.460> kind<00:02:11.850> of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
she just goes for a surf which kind of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.220 
she just goes for a surf which kind of
confused<00:02:12.270> me<00:02:12.390> because<00:02:12.420> surf<00:02:12.840> doesn't<00:02:13.110> really

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
confused me because surf doesn't really

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.640 
confused me because surf doesn't really
do<00:02:13.470> anything<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.950> me<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> leech<00:02:16.470> seed

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
do anything to me and I get a leech seed

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
do anything to me and I get a leech seed
off<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:16.950> him<00:02:17.100> which<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> perfect<00:02:17.970> because

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
off on him which is perfect because

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.880 
off on him which is perfect because
that's<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.480> where<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.780> want<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> poori

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that's just where you want on the poori

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.070 
that's just where you want on the poori
on<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.180> my<00:02:21.210> health<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:21.780> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
on to be so I get all my health back and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.110 
on to be so I get all my health back and
he's<00:02:22.320> losing<00:02:22.620> health<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.370> than<00:02:23.580> gaining<00:02:23.850> it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
he's losing health more than gaining it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.050 
he's losing health more than gaining it
and<00:02:24.300> um<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.320> know<00:02:26.160> he's<00:02:26.400> gonna<00:02:26.490> switch<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.850> here

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and um I know he's gonna switch out here

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.520 
and um I know he's gonna switch out here
and<00:02:27.150> he<00:02:27.210> switched<00:02:27.420> onto<00:02:27.600> an<00:02:27.810> electrode<00:02:28.290> which

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and he switched onto an electrode which

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.710 
and he switched onto an electrode which
wasn't<00:02:29.130> his<00:02:29.430> lead<00:02:29.640> which<00:02:29.850> was<00:02:30.000> surprising<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
wasn't his lead which was surprising and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
wasn't his lead which was surprising and
um<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.340> predicted<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> switching<00:02:32.820> went<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
um I predicted the switching went for a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.760 
um I predicted the switching went for a
leap<00:02:33.300> seed<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> lee<00:02:34.290> sedol<00:02:34.500> front

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
leap seed and I get the lee sedol front

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.490 
leap seed and I get the lee sedol front
electrode<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.550> um<00:02:36.080> ruse<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.320> great

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
electrode and that um ruse to be great

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
electrode and that um ruse to be great
for<00:02:37.710> me<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.250> search<00:02:38.490> on<00:02:38.610> arcanine<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.240> not

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
for me so search on arcanine here not

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.790 
for me so search on arcanine here not
knowing<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.840> he<00:02:39.900> wants<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.170> do<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.590> don't

whatever I don't know what the hell he
wants<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.450> stayed<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.690> an

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
wants to do I could have stayed in an

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.570 
wants to do I could have stayed in an
attack<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.560> wanted<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:46.980> um<00:02:47.190> heal

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
attack but I just wanted to get um heal

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
attack but I just wanted to get um heal
up<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.820> arcanine<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.950> an

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
up with arcanine so I'm just an

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.950 
up with arcanine so I'm just an
electrode<00:02:50.490> here<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> actually<00:02:51.930> I

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
electrode here get the actually I

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.060 
electrode here get the actually I
thought<00:02:52.260> he<00:02:52.350> would<00:02:52.440> go<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.710> explosion

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
thought he would go for the explosion

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.320 
thought he would go for the explosion
that's<00:02:53.130> why<00:02:53.280> certain<00:02:53.550> organized<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
that's why certain organized to get the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660

is the only owe you i have on this team

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.840 
is the only owe you i have on this team
so<00:04:26.500> i<00:04:26.560> decided<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.100> switch<00:04:27.310> right<00:04:27.490> back<00:04:27.669> out

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
so i decided to switch right back out

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.760 
so i decided to switch right back out
into<00:04:28.030> my<00:04:28.270> tomtom<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.139> get<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.410> trick<00:04:29.620> off

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
into my tomtom just to get the trick off

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.189 
into my tomtom just to get the trick off
on<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.010> guy<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:31.330> do<00:04:31.389> go<00:04:31.660> for<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.870> trick

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
on this guy and I do go for the trick

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.070 
on this guy and I do go for the trick
and<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:33.520> cripples<00:04:34.030> his<00:04:34.180> Snorlax<00:04:34.630> severely

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
and that cripples his Snorlax severely

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.100 
and that cripples his Snorlax severely
so<00:04:35.500> now<00:04:35.650> he<00:04:36.100> goes<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.550> stockpile<00:04:36.970> as<00:04:37.840> i<00:04:37.990> go

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
so now he goes to a stockpile as i go

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.510 
so now he goes to a stockpile as i go
for<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.260> trick<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.710> stuck<00:04:39.010> on<00:04:39.130> stockpile

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
for the trick and I stuck on stockpile

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.620 
for the trick and I stuck on stockpile
so<00:04:39.669> there's<00:04:39.820> no<00:04:39.880> point<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.120> him<00:04:40.240> staying<00:04:40.449> and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
so there's no point in him staying and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.700 
so there's no point in him staying and
so<00:04:40.720> you're<00:04:40.840> gonna<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.229> switch<00:04:41.440> out<00:04:41.590> he

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
so you're gonna have to switch out he

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.200 
so you're gonna have to switch out he
searches<00:04:41.949> out<00:04:42.010> into<00:04:42.250> fortress<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.970> go<00:04:43.090> for

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
searches out into fortress and I go for

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.610 
searches out into fortress and I go for
the<00:04:43.270> Thunderbolt<00:04:43.630> knowing<00:04:43.780> he<00:04:43.870> has<00:04:43.990> vaporeon

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
the Thunderbolt knowing he has vaporeon

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.860 
the Thunderbolt knowing he has vaporeon

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
he goes into scissor but he does pack

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.279 
he goes into scissor but he does pack
the<00:05:09.940> pursuit<00:05:10.210> he<00:05:10.360> takes<00:05:10.570> out<00:05:10.720> my<00:05:10.840> route<00:05:11.020> on<00:05:11.169> no

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
problem so that's the first book when he

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.439 
problem so that's the first book when he
takes<00:05:12.639> out<00:05:12.820> for<00:05:12.970> me<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.240> um<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.669> predict<00:05:15.669> I'd<00:05:16.180> go

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
on to Venus or get the leaf sedo if I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.379 
on to Venus or get the leaf sedo if I
predictive<00:05:18.520> search<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.789> wouldn't<00:05:19.150> eat<00:05:19.210> it

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389
