your enemies in one or two bursts pretty

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
your enemies in one or two bursts pretty
much<00:00:33.690> every<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.650> hit<00:00:34.829> them<00:00:34.980> above<00:00:35.340> the

much every time you hit them above the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.670 
much every time you hit them above the
waist<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.320> actual

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
waist so let's get right into the actual

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.460 
waist so let's get right into the actual
stats<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.760> variation<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.989> steel<00:00:40.290> by

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
stats for this variation of the steel by

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.050 
stats for this variation of the steel by
and<00:00:40.710> basically<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.700> three

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
and basically you're going to have three

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.180 
and basically you're going to have three
points<00:00:42.329> increase<00:00:42.810> in<00:00:43.110> damage<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.010> it's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
points increase in damage so it's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.610 
points increase in damage so it's
literally<00:00:44.580> like<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.030> laser<00:00:45.420> beam<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> it's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
literally like a laser beam and it's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
literally like a laser beam and it's
going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:47.100> point<00:00:47.370> decrease<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
going to have a two point decrease in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.870 
going to have a two point decrease in
accuracy<00:00:48.810> at<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.590> point<00:00:49.860> decrease<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> fire

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
accuracy at one point decrease in fire

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.540 
accuracy at one point decrease in fire
rate<00:00:51.120> honestly<00:00:51.900> guys<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.560> damage<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.280> makes

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
rate honestly guys the damage just makes

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
rate honestly guys the damage just makes
it<00:00:53.700> so<00:00:53.760> good<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.200> have<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it so good that you don't really have to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.470 
it so good that you don't really have to
worry<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> fire<00:00:56.700> rate<00:00:56.970> you<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.150> need

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
worry about the fire rate you just need

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
worry about the fire rate you just need
to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.720> accurate<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.470> make<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.580> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to be accurate to make up for the two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.510 
to be accurate to make up for the two
points<00:01:00.300> decrease<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:01.110> accuracy<00:01:01.560> so<00:01:02.340> overall

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
points decrease in accuracy so overall

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.369 
points decrease in accuracy so overall
this<00:01:02.820> gun<00:01:03.060> is<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.110> let's<00:01:04.199> get

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this gun is very very good and let's get

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.859 
this gun is very very good and let's get
right<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.100> class<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.630> far<00:01:06.810> as

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
right into the class up so as far as

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.140 
right into the class up so as far as
attachments<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> love<00:01:08.220> using<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.759> foregrip

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
attachments go I love using the foregrip

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
attachments go I love using the foregrip
and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> red<00:01:09.659> dot<00:01:09.840> side<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.860> works

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and the red dot side I think that works

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
and the red dot side I think that works
the<00:01:11.220> best<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.390> iron

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the best I don't really like the iron

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
sight that comes with the ARX so I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
sight that comes with the ARX so I
definitely<00:01:15.000> recommend<00:01:15.390> using<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> red<00:01:16.530> dot

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
definitely recommend using the red dot

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
definitely recommend using the red dot
sight<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.520> far<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.880> Kirk<00:01:18.180> skill<00:01:18.510> i<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:19.050> use

works out the best so then you're going

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.110 
works out the best so then you're going
to<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.900> three<00:01:31.440> points<00:01:31.740> left<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.700> spend<00:01:32.940> on

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120

you win the gunfights it's going to be a
little<00:01:59.960> bit<00:02:00.170> harder<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.560> face<00:02:01.009> is<00:02:01.310> a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
little bit harder to face is a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.850 
little bit harder to face is a

submachine gun someone who has like the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.859 
submachine gun someone who has like the
ASM<00:02:04.250> one<00:02:04.430> for<00:02:04.640> example<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.509> just<00:02:05.690> want<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
ASM one for example if you just want to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:06.880 
ASM one for example if you just want to
make<00:02:06.020> sure<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:06.500> hitting<00:02:06.740> them

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
make sure that you're hitting them

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.639 
make sure that you're hitting them
directly<00:02:07.460> in<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.940> face<00:02:08.209> next<00:02:09.170> question

number<00:02:09.830> two<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.310> kind<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.580> good<00:02:10.729> on<00:02:10.850> small

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
number two is this kind of good on small

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000 
number two is this kind of good on small
medium<00:02:11.510> or<00:02:11.600> large<00:02:11.660> max<00:02:12.050> it's<00:02:12.530> good<00:02:12.709> i'm<00:02:12.800> pretty

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
medium or large max it's good i'm pretty

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.830 
medium or large max it's good i'm pretty
much<00:02:13.069> all<00:02:13.370> maps<00:02:13.700> i've<00:02:13.940> used<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:14.720> of

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
much all maps i've used it on all of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.750 
much all maps i've used it on all of
them<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.200> i<00:02:15.230> would<00:02:15.350> say<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.500> overall<00:02:16.040> this

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
them and i would say that overall this

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.870 
them and i would say that overall this
gun<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.660> good<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.080> maps<00:02:18.410> like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
gun is really really good on maps like

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.640 
gun is really really good on maps like
this<00:02:19.880> map<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.510> example<00:02:20.989> things<00:02:21.320> like<00:02:21.410> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
this map for example things like that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.280 
this map for example things like that
you<00:02:21.709> want<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.130> be<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.489> larger<00:02:23.209> map<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.780> think

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
you want to be on a larger map I think

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.660 
you want to be on a larger map I think
it's<00:02:24.410> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.590> work<00:02:24.739> out<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.070> best<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's going to work out the best but you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.300 
it's going to work out the best but you
still<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.360> use<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.810> on<00:02:26.959> smaller<00:02:27.290> maps<00:02:27.590> Pusha

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
still can use it on smaller maps Pusha

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.040 
still can use it on smaller maps Pusha
number<00:02:28.610> three<00:02:28.820> what<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.360> best<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.870> worst

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
number three what is the best and worst

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.540 
number three what is the best and worst
feature<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.650> come<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> best<00:02:31.340> feature

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
of this time is definitely the overall

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.729 
of this time is definitely the overall

gun<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> words<00:02:43.280> feature<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
gun and the words feature is the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.160 
gun and the words feature is the
decrease<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.720> accuracy<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.150> delete<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.360> little

decrease in accuracy and delete a little
bit<00:02:48.290> less<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.130> fire<00:02:49.400> rate<00:02:49.640> not<00:02:49.850> really<00:02:50.209> too

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
bit less of a fire rate not really too

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.170 
bit less of a fire rate not really too
dramatic<00:02:51.470> though<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.160> next<00:02:52.370> question<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.880> one

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
dramatic though the next question is one

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.170 
dramatic though the next question is one
on<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.959> scale<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.380> one<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.709> ten<00:02:55.040> ten<00:02:55.070> be<00:02:55.579> amazing

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
on a scale of one to ten ten be amazing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.789 
on a scale of one to ten ten be amazing
order<00:02:56.720> rate<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.989> scan<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.350> would<00:02:57.500> rate<00:02:57.650> this

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
order rate the scan I would rate this

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.069 
order rate the scan I would rate this
gun<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> 8.5<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.269> think<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.810> gun<00:03:00.049> is
