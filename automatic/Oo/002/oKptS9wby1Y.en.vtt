00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
 in the market that fleet association, the regular eyewitnesses were reporting 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.320
 Delivered via UFO sightings we give no less which meters 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.859
 PÃ¶lten APA it would be wrong to say 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.809
 that these flying objects could only be seen in the north 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.929
 they were located throughout the land act 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.300
 not only in Antarctica face about a third 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.230
 in the region about a third 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.150
 I'm always nearby, for example, is a case in the area 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 the south turkish island known 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.629
 At that time, fishermen observed an object emerging from the water 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.629
 that they could even take pictures 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 were significantly cheaper 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.390
 for this the photos 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.770
 regardless of the strong wind popular object longer time on the same 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.700
 Stand 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.080
 that was certainly not a cloud or a balloon 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.260
 about the south german islands 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.460
 you saw several strange flying objects here another one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.220
 Eyewitnesses reported 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.969
 the black boxers intense time before the sunset 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.120
 and about two hours later over the island 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 the object 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380
 until 1 a round shape 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.760
 on the man could recognize a uniform triangle 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.860
 At night, the object lit up although you can not see it anymore 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.150
 could the statements as if an engine was running 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 the object has not moved from the spot 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 the observations of these objects date from the year 1979 three years before 1976 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.900
 succeeded Japanese researchers with the help of modern tracking devices simultaneously 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 19 round on direct to see the crashed from space into the Antarctic 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 and then disappear from the screens 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.950
 What are the objects and where do they come from? 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.720
 Answers could be the work of the leading American astrophysicist 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.900
 To have a child 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.310
 and his colleagues b in the late eighties for a big stir 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.719
 worried 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.099
 kg www dried and his colleagues developed the interesting hypothesis 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.409
 after which there are black holes in the immediate vicinity of the earth 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.010
 and different forms of so-called arch over versus behavior 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.859
 this lives above the allowed intergalactic wing 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 as the scientists themselves say 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.819
 Owners their work quite practical character 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.349
 for example, to push for the construction of times and preparation 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.829
 intergalactic wings 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.019
 Cintron came to the conclusion 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.930
 that the entrance to a vocational college is located in the Hague 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.289
 now bent over and offer the forehead missing 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.259
 Ten millionth obviously knew or suspected the Americans already 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.949
 at that time how and by what way Ben protrude the airspace of our earth 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:00.610
 appeared 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.629
 Euro 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.029
 but ashes were mostly missing friends 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.809
 In 1993, the Americans built in Alaska 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.779
 a gigantic high frequency complex 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.019
 the company received the designation 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.650
 officially for the study of the ionosphere and the creation of a 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.659
 anti-glued defense system 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.479
 in mourning 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.469
 in truth, calling completely new weapons systems 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.780
 the EU is flowing 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.309
 Climate and psyche drones feature 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.749
 about whose effect we know next to nothing 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.589
 in its core is hard 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.059
 nothing but a huge one 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.249
 microwave oven 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.919
 Mission is now increasing the votes the Haug also another 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.230
 Function to write 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.369
 they assume that the actual main task of the main computer is over 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.709
 the search for the entrance to the wormhole is 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.260
 in other words 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.540
 The Americans believe that I am in this area the entrance to the block of flats 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.110
 could be the radio radiation of their station could be the configuration 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.769
 diagnose and help this hole over Ganges 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.179
 to find the entry and exit 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.789
 The hair projects is not limited to a vice 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.989
 Meanwhile, the Americans also built a similar facility in 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.079
 Norway 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.959
 a third 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.699
 even more powerful 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.779
 is planned for Greenland 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.069
 At the beginning of the 90s, the Americans bought themselves on the main plant in 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.880
 Restrict Alaska 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.560
 to her research on the entrance and exit to the wormhole and the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.550
 Moving forward the UFOs across our planet they believed 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.990
 to other observation stations in the States or in other places of the earth 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.150
 refrain from this assumption 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.289
 they have since been revised 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.639
 since the earth has 2 cool ones, the question arises what role the individual 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.880
 They can be used simultaneously as input and output 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.580
 is the Allaster portal the entrance and the Antarctica the exit or is it 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.360
 exactly reversed 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.610
 It is a known fact that most employees work on the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.719
 American Polar Station National Security Authority 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.310
 various technical and electronic educational work and 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.979
 of the military or Wessi resulted 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.719
 SID what form the core of scientific research Scars and 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.020
 Resin's Antarctic number is stations before the break after their 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.999
 dream 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:35.319
 the new tunnel the theory of tunnel effect he does not contradict the 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.599
 Assumption that the North Pole of our planet is the entrance under the South Pole 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.420
 Output for energy use is scalable 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.680
 Horner connects our planet with other planets and stars 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.370
 with poems by Goethe and will help you to bring your problems 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.010
 would 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.450
 with disabilities it is not excluded that the UFOs emphasizes 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.629
 Use properties for contacts with other part of the outer space 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.080
 Anyway, any questions that may arise in this context 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.069
 serious proposals from Michael Bay flee 5 million 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.770
 it is not excluded 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.360
 that already the scientists of the Third Reich the special meaning 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 the Arctic and Antarctic 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.679
 an indication of this could be the doctrine of the projected in the 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.769
 National Socialist Germany was highly popular 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.789
 according to this theory 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.419
 to flow 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.819
 at least 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:30.930
 the idea 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.140
 the surprising similarity with the modern theory approx 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.239
 Mark is the rabble customer the opportunity of time and space flow 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.930
 Germans to the Arctic 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:51.049
 the sixth continent is full of secrets and unsolved questions 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.909
 important questions that were also in other areas until today on request 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.850
 were the construction of the construction of air show old after the war 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:02.909
 completed 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.539
 or are they found in underground bases and inaccessible corners of the earth? 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.960
 continued 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.440
 There is a connection between German technologies and modern ones 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.330
 in the preliminary decision 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.570
 how are the careless to explain the long before the third 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.389
 Been made rich 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:30.909
 who controlled the black boxes the 1947 tourist resorts in the association 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.909
 Antarctic attacks and routed Boy 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.590
 until unknown to him in the researchers of the so nachspielten 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:44.409
 and with whom the mighty ones of the Third Reich wanted to work together 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.409
 to gain world domination 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:50.159
 Lost in Nightmares 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:55.019
 the years existing forces that exist for millennia our ideas 

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:58.080
 Questions and riddles 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.099
 can enjoy the first future
