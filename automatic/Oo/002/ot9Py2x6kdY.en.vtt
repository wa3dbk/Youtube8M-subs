00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.870 
Remy touch qp9 this is what she looks
like<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:12.150> color<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.860> she<00:00:13.889> has<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.610> bangs

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
like on the color so she has the bangs

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.060 
like on the color so she has the bangs
and<00:00:15.240> she's<00:00:15.540> very<00:00:15.630> long<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.440> tapered<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and she's very long and tapered in the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.990 
and she's very long and tapered in the
back<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:18.000> color<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.570> got<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.410> 1b<00:00:20.039> so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
back the color that I got is a 1b so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.509 
back the color that I got is a 1b so
let's<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.890> far<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.279> cap

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
let's get into it as far as cap

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
let's get into it as far as cap
construction<00:00:23.699> she<00:00:24.359> has<00:00:24.570> lace<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> very

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
construction she has lace at the very

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.670 
construction she has lace at the very
top<00:00:26.090> just<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.210> bit<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.960> closure<00:00:28.320> in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
top just a little bit of a closure in

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
top just a little bit of a closure in
the<00:00:28.830> center<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> tracks<00:00:31.080> are

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the center this is how the tracks are

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.600 
the center this is how the tracks are
spaced<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.290> not<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.500> close<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
spaced out so not as close as I like it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.440 
spaced out so not as close as I like it
so<00:00:35.850> therefore<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> unit<00:00:36.960> isn't<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.770> dense<00:00:38.489> she

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so therefore the unit isn't as dense she

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.280 
so therefore the unit isn't as dense she
does<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.350> thick<00:00:40.950> band<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.290> so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
does have a very thick band around it so

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
does have a very thick band around it so
I'm<00:00:43.379> supposed<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.399> band<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> would

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
I'm supposed to like a band that would

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.770 
I'm supposed to like a band that would
be<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> dome<00:00:45.870> cap<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.070> she<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:48.030> combs

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
be on a dome cap and she has these combs

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.700 
be on a dome cap and she has these combs
at<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.449> at<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:51.870> front<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
at the back and at the very front of the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
at the back and at the very front of the
unit<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.180> let's<00:00:54.360> try<00:00:54.600> her<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.410> what

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
unit so let's try her on and see what

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610 
unit so let's try her on and see what
she<00:00:55.739> looks<00:00:55.890> like

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.240 

off<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.579> bat<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.270> have<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:01.980> small<00:01:02.980> head

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
off the bat if you have a small head

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.469 
off the bat if you have a small head
like<00:01:03.910> myself<00:01:05.490> she's<00:01:06.490> gonna<00:01:06.670> be<00:01:06.850> very<00:01:06.880> very

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
like myself she's gonna be very very

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:15.270 
like myself she's gonna be very very
loose<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.810> as<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.290> see<00:01:14.590> she<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.220> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
loose on you so as you can see she is a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.680 
loose on you so as you can see she is a
very<00:01:16.180> fine<00:01:17.050> not<00:01:17.800> dense<00:01:18.430> at<00:01:18.790> all

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
very fine not dense at all

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.830 
very fine not dense at all
I<00:01:19.740> feel<00:01:20.740> like<00:01:20.890> she's<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.100> little<00:01:21.369> bit<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:22.720> of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
I feel like she's a little bit kind of

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.800 
I feel like she's a little bit kind of
Coney<00:01:23.320> at<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.979> top<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.700> would<00:01:25.149> definitely<00:01:25.690> need

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
Coney at the top I would definitely need

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.510 
Coney at the top I would definitely need
something<00:01:26.170> that's<00:01:26.470> going<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:26.770> tighten<00:01:27.340> her<00:01:27.490> up

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
something that's going to tighten her up

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.600 
something that's going to tighten her up
a<00:01:27.820> little<00:01:28.210> bit<00:01:28.360> more<00:01:28.899> for<00:01:29.799> my<00:01:30.009> head

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
a little bit more for my head

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.719 
a little bit more for my head
the<00:01:31.090> captain<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.780> definitely<00:01:32.619> too<00:01:32.890> big<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.610> if

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
the captain is definitely too big so if

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.660 
the captain is definitely too big so if
you<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> smaller<00:01:34.509> head<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:36.039> probably

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
you have a smaller head then I probably

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.880 
you have a smaller head then I probably
wouldn't<00:01:37.090> recommend<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.289> but<00:01:38.740> as

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
wouldn't recommend this for you but as

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.090 
wouldn't recommend this for you but as
far<00:01:39.160> as<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.490> style<00:01:39.789> it<00:01:40.119> is<00:01:40.240> very<00:01:40.720> very<00:01:41.050> cute

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
far as the style it is very very cute

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.570 
far as the style it is very very cute
I<00:01:43.050> would<00:01:44.050> have<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.440> actually<00:01:44.890> put<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:45.399> an

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
I would have to actually put like an

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.609 
I would have to actually put like an
elastic<00:01:45.940> band<00:01:46.420> strap<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.960> here<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.500> it

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
elastic band strap in here just so it

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.290 
elastic band strap in here just so it
could<00:01:47.740> fit<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> little<00:01:48.159> bit<00:01:48.369> more<00:01:48.580> snug<00:01:48.880> than<00:01:48.940> my

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
could fit a little bit more snug than my

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.139 
could fit a little bit more snug than my
head<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.810> it's<00:01:50.440> not<00:01:50.560> shifting<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.670> sliding

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
head and it's not shifting and sliding

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.190 
head and it's not shifting and sliding
all<00:01:52.210> over<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.600> place

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
all over the place

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.370 
all over the place
so<00:01:53.679> she's<00:01:53.890> very<00:01:54.179> realistic-looking<00:01:55.179> as<00:01:55.780> far

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
so she's very realistic-looking as far

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.790 
so she's very realistic-looking as far
as<00:01:56.649> density<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.970> hair<00:01:58.179> feels<00:01:58.479> very<00:01:58.869> nice<00:01:59.319> more

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
as density the hair feels very nice more

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.330 
as density the hair feels very nice more
like<00:02:00.039> yaki<00:02:00.399> here<00:02:01.110> these<00:02:02.110> companies<00:02:02.530> are<00:02:02.890> doing

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
like yaki here these companies are doing

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.520 
like yaki here these companies are doing
it<00:02:03.550> with<00:02:03.759> these<00:02:03.970> synthetic<00:02:04.599> wigs<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.140> mean<00:02:05.319> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it with these synthetic wigs I mean the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.520 
it with these synthetic wigs I mean the
hairs<00:02:05.890> actually<00:02:06.399> feel<00:02:07.030> really<00:02:07.630> really<00:02:08.080> good

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
hairs actually feel really really good

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.699 
hairs actually feel really really good
so<00:02:09.190> her<00:02:09.369> name<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.610> Remy<00:02:10.420> touch<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.290> I'm

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
so her name is Remy touch so I'm

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.380 
so her name is Remy touch so I'm
assuming<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.550> hairs<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.849> they<00:02:13.000> used

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
assuming that the hairs that they used
