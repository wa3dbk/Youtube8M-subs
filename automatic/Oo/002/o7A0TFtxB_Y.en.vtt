00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
elaborate system back here you see I've

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.569 
elaborate system back here you see I've

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
modelling not just the proximity but

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.839

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
also the curvature of that car behind me

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.369 
also the curvature of that car behind me
for<00:02:09.030> example<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:09.869> gives<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> some

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
for example so it really gives you some
