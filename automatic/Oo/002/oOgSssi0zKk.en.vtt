 strive numbers to put the effects 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 decide from the internet support yourself 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.079
 that it's never far from well and in any case 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.319
 this series will be called as you have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 seen from the title masochistic attacks e 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.489
 not even we will take the practical steps 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.229
 this series 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.260
 now we show you a replay but 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.300
 live attacks will generally be on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.829
 these attacks will practically challenge us 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.929
 imax to you that is those you like 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:08.190
 all at best and it will not matter is the 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:10.950
 percentage but if you win no short, but 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 the important thing will be if we find the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 balls of going against each other is done 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.640
 see from the chat of the clan that play 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 because if you don't see if it's fake 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.720
 uncle's piece would also be berlin 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.480
 see how much we can do precise 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 here it is you guys write the 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.090
 itch meanwhile in the comments as second 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.750
 I will do a percentage starting the attack 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.910
 I wanted to say that we took it for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.980
 the provisional a replay also because from 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.990
 this replay gave us the idea of ​​doing 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.280
 this series and in the next episodes 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.680
 They will also be talking to light 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 conditionally for they will be at all the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.490
 I didn't say live before 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 here it begins the attack I send 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.549
 mastiffs 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.810
 strangely the balloons do not make me 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.479
 so much the clan troops 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.640
 I also had ass who were archers in 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.170
 some sense 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.369
 look at them how many green ones they are 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.769
 come out neon ie there is a casino yes yes 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 they also exaggerated with traps 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.140
 skeletons in my opinion , however, should be put 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.440
 I do not god you for poma and year they pay a little 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.170
 have ruined the bow this is mine 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 opinion of course then boh you want 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.000
 may also be the stone thing of 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.720
 world is not that I'm criticizing what 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.849
 you would like the clash of plants the various is the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.799
 also a removal of 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.269
 something he had no one there 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.069
 has ever proposed what you would like 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.940
 supplying a removal 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.220
 well in short this is the crucial moment 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.049
 of the attack boys then so much you already have 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.629
 written the percentage that you think 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.280
 I'll do it if you haven't done it now 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:57.280
 because last seconds available 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 you will understand the henchmen remain with the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.880
 prison region to risk everything 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.780
 but he manages to kill a barbarian king 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.519
 at 40 the cloth the pianist of the hero 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.510
 then I still haven't figured out how much they have 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:17.590
 sure drop comes to the omitted cock but it goes 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.889
 well here is a 44 percent send 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 cards on the dead end of the village 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.220
 hoping to get to do 50 for 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.660
 a hundred, but I see very hard 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.790
 so who breaks the balls for the third 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.819
 time write us how much you do second 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.700
 you 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.859
 to us tonight put for 5 percent 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.159
 however, one can not even think of seeing 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.819
 the holiday coffers the approximation 15 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.950
 second line splits a wall there 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.889
 another joke but sportlab 49 per 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.040
 hundred here it is c c map for percent and le 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:58.700
 other 50 percent 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.650
 this time the series went well 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.469
 however, he calls masochistic attacks 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.209
 it does not necessarily mean that it always goes well 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.189
 the important thing was the resources 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.139
 of course that in fact gave me the 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:14.480
 resources are quite important 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:16.060
 the black elixir may be possible not 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.109
 they had the moon and the bible beckham 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.090
 upgrade because there is protection 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.470
 of ends today 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.509
 so you have to improve 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.740
 this series of course I'll have to do myself 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.460
 frame clans 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.090
 at level 6 because 5 troops does not appear 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.070
 but they can really make a difference 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.669
 no nothing I'll have to upgrade a lot 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.340
 the hero to grow or bassini and is a 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:47.900
 casino to acquire above all are 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.729
 highs are an 80 m outta brassens of 13 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.370
 meters can land 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.860
 at 43 but if you liked this 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.009
