 of speech and speech disorders 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.160
 The aim here is to score potential complication difficulty of the patients

 and patients 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.189

 maximum can 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 a bit longer but logical division, the area is limited 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.769
 Max said in the area around recording logical disturbances elated 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.780
 as a success story that I have succeeded very well to measure Orin's moves 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 I have to get the work done on the evening of the 3 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.480
 Serious and straight patient can be managed in a way next to leather 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.039
 in the gate June or on the art station closed department 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.560
 or in the intensive care department 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.740
 and since we are called to the patients, so to speak 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 the speech therapist contacts the patient and looks at which the saint 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.930
 but the mood is not so well managed he has agreed to the track 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.090
 If you have ten years had space 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.480
 and then a fierce put put the returns together 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.380
 to 10 a speech and speech disorders 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 there are tuning disturbances 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 the Hanseaten defended also for orders 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.280
 it is a swallowing problem so we still have an accurate diagnosis 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.479
 need 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.550
 it is the so-called industrial history press 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.759
 Orenburg dpa 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.829
 March carried trench skin system 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.899
 and then we can see further 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.950
 is the set what is necessary 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.909
 at 100 points 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.880
 also the family counseling 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 Procter place in the band too affected is no longer talking came Rossi 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.229
 Speaking restricted did not have to swallow or just confessed 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.130
 have to swallow 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.689
 He is, of course, the family with the big one and our job is 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.099
 to look at the relatives 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.989
 Arcor in the best possible way 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.749
 Passersby had the adolescent had concerns we ourselves have to counter 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.349
 individually designed 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.769
 one after which the disturbance the situation it is planned 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.299
 both teams of different grades and heavy trucks and it will 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.319
 not at the speech therapist this liability bed 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.179
 we work here in an interdisciplinary team 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.689
 therefore advised as well with attaching of data protectors 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.999
 a comeback of the un-speakers on Sunday evening local time in Oaxaca 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.299
 now dives the length of stay 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.379
 with the interdisciplinary team 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.049
 agreed 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.520
 below ran the patient numbers 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.669
 No, not me Â»said Loose 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.009
 and when does the continuing Habilitationen come and can use 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.889
 in a later phase of rehabilitation 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.529
 Finally, the therapeutic offer is still too early occupational therapy 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.159
 added 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.180
 Herbert Harrer low loader independent acting in the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.709
 Performances of daily life productive working and designing 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.789
 creativity 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.809
 but different treatment options are in the 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.989
 Occupational therapy offer existing skills 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.899
 compensated for lost opportunities 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.899
 if necessary replaced by auxiliaries 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 he started meant activity as held 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.889
 The competition assumes that activity is important to the person 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.919
 and that has the healing effect 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.919
 therefore the earth is not the passive form of treatment 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.439
 but requires the patient to actively collaborate on physical mental 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.439
 and in optional 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.529
 our patients are experiencing limitations due to illnesses 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.529
 Coping with your personal everyday life 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.529
 This starts with the daily body care while eating and drinking 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.829
 and goes to the break as 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.689
 and so exercise their occupation 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.230
 and very important for the people are also the restrictions Indian 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.719
 family and social life leadership he will yes the work 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.459
 with the patient possibilities in personal everyday life again as possible 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.620
 independently 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.419
 has to cope 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.939
 Bending the earth, various measures are available 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.099
 on the one hand 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.840
 stop it offers the opportunity 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.279
 regain lost functions 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.319
 she trains four publishers Loki with the patient for example 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.949
 Movement Sensitivity or dexterity 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.280
 on the other hand, but also cognitive skills such as 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.740
 memory 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.189
 planning stang 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.279
 Problem solve concentration 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.169
 on the other hand, relationships too often can not 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.699
 Restores and disabilities remain 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.419
 In this case, the earth Derby compensation options on 2 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.159
 that can be aids 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.050
 but these can be portions in 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.279
 in the personal besides environment 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.330
 but that can also be granted 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
 Yes, you can handle old activities in new ways 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.550
 and apply again 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.550
 this 90's gives him to learn and apply 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.639
 also the clinical neuropsychology the topics and the professionalism of the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.639
 Neurorehabilitation an important role 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.099
 Neuropsychology deals now offers Mustique and the rehabilitative 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.739
 Therapy of disorders of higher brain powers after reduction of a 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:39.969
 brain injury 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.719
 the orientation 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.469
 attention 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.680
 memory 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.630
 The neuropsychological diagnosis often succeeds over many different ones

 is supposedly Sirte investigation methods 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.889
 it records both deficits and benefits received by a patient 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.319
 or a patient and is the basis for a targeted therapy 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:08.269

 with a total of 131 beds is one of the largest neurology in austria 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.789
 while in the founding in 1977 almost exclusively stroke 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.569
 Patients were treated 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.099
 10 today also treat patients after one 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.270
 skull-brain trauma as well as treating people with whoever 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.880
 a problems and neurological conditions hurts 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.919

 by those who never support it so easily 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.730
 how much linking acute care 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.860
 Under the EU PlayStation under one roof ensures as well 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.499
 that the patients are treated according to the clinic 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:29.219
