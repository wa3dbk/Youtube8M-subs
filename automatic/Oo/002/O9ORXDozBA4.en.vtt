00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 nico congratulations on the victory that there 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.100
 super light from what your series today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.660
 I would already have conjured up ice 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.929
 it was so easy to say 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.240
 no of course we do not understand each other 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.460
 that's great, I think almost every one thinks 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.400
 game 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.770
 Well, what should I say? 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.240
 nevertheless hard against any opponent though 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 we know how we play 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.939
 know how we run and always give 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 our best 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.179
 have you thought about the penalty? 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.920
 you're doing so I 'm trying to make it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.710
 because you are training but gentlemanly 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.880
 business so far already know it 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.860
 thought okay he does not know 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.350
 I'll try that and coach 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.329
 what do you expect from sunday before 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 play of the return game quasi against head 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.989
 were 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.460
 I think that now know how 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 we play but we know it now 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 I think that's a bit too 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.300
 More will go on body and kicked 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 maybe three of us will try it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 want to turn off but wait see that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.129
 game was balanced today and think 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
 that I will hand on sunday as well 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.049
 right now it's time for the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.040
 at the table 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.380
 no no maybe look yourself 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
 any youngest buses the table 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.680
 and tell me but I have it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 not himself and so small 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.729
 bit celebrate the inside so today 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.490
 we can celebrate a bit 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.920
 We are happy to sit and talk buses laugh 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.450
 We are happy 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.189
 Tomorrow we will have training about tomorrow 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 everything goes on the same wish you 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.479
 good luck for sunday I press the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.520
 thumb that steven outstanding game 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 you have a little bit for that today 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.090
 researched what the crimmitschau in 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 In any case I believe in it 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.330
 Crimmitschau is just as good 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.070
 I think I have done 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.420
 us little missed ourselves 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.530
 Reward but I think we have 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.600
 definitely made up for today 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.310
 Today a first-rate chance 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.409
 recovery but 100 defensive good 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.119
 confessed what was ultimately 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.670
 crucial from your point of view 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.100
 gates or rather the defensive because it 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.840
 of course, also goals to win 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.759
 but there's nothing to be dropped 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.049
 behind and I believe something from one 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.420
 good defensive comes then too 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.460
 Of course good chances in the storm 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 it did well today too 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.259
 chance as you said, well transformed 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.840
 How was that after the 5 to 3 have 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.190
 you there already thought that was it but 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.989
 I think they are already 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.519
 come and they have a great one 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.750
 superman crew I mean they have that 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.700
 you can find yours very well 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 recorded and they have again 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.239
 shown but I think we have one 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.560
 Good job again on the defensive 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.530
 made and then thrown everything 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.630
 and deservedly won against frankfurt 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.640
 I would say what did you do as 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.310
 we went to the cabin after the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.350
 Of course, victory is already celebrating and celebrating 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.930
 secure a bit and hugs 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.760
 but on sunday is the first game 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.750
 and training again tomorrow and then 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.380
 we want the next on sunday 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.850
 high 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.320
 I'll tell the coach of 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.780
 Kaufbeuren was at the press conference 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.040
 madly what do you expect from sunday 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.799
 I think we will definitely 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.209
 come even more like here now but us 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.070
 have to hold against it and our game 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.120
 play and then I do not think so 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.480
 Bear in mind that we are there somehow 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.459
 go down or so again great 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.670
 game and I'm looking forward to Sunday 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.670
 then
