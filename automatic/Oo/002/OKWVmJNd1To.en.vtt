 flip is an aquino maneuver is not much of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.880
 if you see in the strict it can be a little 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.290

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.809

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:10.730
 normal, that's it , but the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:17.530
 corner position of having more or less between 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:21.230
 the wheels that the other reduces screw are not 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.990
 around and walks away 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.780

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.709

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.709
