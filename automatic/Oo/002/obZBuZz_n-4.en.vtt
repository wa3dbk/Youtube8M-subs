pick up this application because it
really<00:01:23.009> does<00:01:23.070> speed<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> process<00:01:23.790> because

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
really does speed up the process because

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.580 
really does speed up the process because
otherwise<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> send<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
otherwise you would have to send this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
otherwise you would have to send this
picture<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.130> computer<00:01:26.520> open<00:01:26.909> up

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
Photoshop and apply a Gaussian blur

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
Photoshop and apply a Gaussian blur
filter<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
filter but if not you can just use the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.899 
filter but if not you can just use the
blur<00:01:31.409> application<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> adjust<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> different

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
levels of blur until you find something

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
levels of blur until you find something
that<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.119> fuzzy

blurry<00:01:37.110> pictures<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.799> my<00:01:37.979> iOS<00:01:38.189> 7<00:01:38.759> device

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
blurry pictures on my iOS 7 device

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
blurry pictures on my iOS 7 device
because<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.659> iOS<00:01:40.020> 7<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
because I think iOS 7 and the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
because I think iOS 7 and the
translucency<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.970> combination<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
translucency in combination with the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.200 
translucency in combination with the
blur<00:01:43.079> actually<00:01:43.439> looks<00:01:43.619> very<00:01:43.920> very<00:01:43.979> nice<00:01:44.399> now

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
blur actually looks very very nice now

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.580

digitizer devices now i'm going to show
you<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.969> example<00:02:06.180> again<00:02:06.630> within<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> image

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you this example again within the image

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
you this example again within the image
that<00:02:07.290> hasn't<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:07.890> been<00:02:08.069> cropped<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.330> as

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that hasn't actually been cropped so as

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.880 
that hasn't actually been cropped so as
you<00:02:09.569> guys<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.470> image<00:02:10.709> which

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you guys can see this is an image which

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
you guys can see this is an image which
has<00:02:11.129> black<00:02:11.459> bars<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> top<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> bottom

has black bars on the top and the bottom

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.240 
has black bars on the top and the bottom
and<00:02:12.840> if

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and if

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.620 
and if
I insert<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:13.670> into<00:02:13.850> blurry<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.240> can<00:02:14.450> see

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
I insert this into blurry you can see

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.300 
I insert this into blurry you can see
that<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:15.020> are<00:02:15.050> black<00:02:15.470> bars<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> top<00:02:16.010> and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that there are black bars on the top and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.830 
that there are black bars on the top and
the<00:02:16.400> bottom<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.880> combat<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.690> can

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
the bottom and to combat this you can

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
the bottom and to combat this you can
either<00:02:18.050> blur<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.560> all<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.860> way<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.670> you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
either blur it all the way but if you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.100 
either blur it all the way but if you
don't<00:02:19.940> want<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.300> using<00:02:20.630> Apple's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
don't want to do that using Apple's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.410 
don't want to do that using Apple's
built<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.620> or<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.400> photo<00:02:22.580> applications<00:02:23.180> built

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
built in or the photo applications built

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.600 
built in or the photo applications built
in<00:02:23.750> cropping<00:02:24.320> editor<00:02:25.010> thing<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.460> can

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
in cropping editor thing you can

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.950 
in cropping editor thing you can
basically<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.180> crop<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.570> image<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.840> little

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
basically just crop the image a little

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.780 
basically just crop the image a little
bit<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:27.890> worry<00:02:28.070> about<00:02:28.130> losing<00:02:28.460> quality

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
bit and don't worry about losing quality

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.280 
bit and don't worry about losing quality
because<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> image<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.959> be<00:02:30.050> blurred

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
because the image is going to be blurred

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.810 
because the image is going to be blurred
out<00:02:30.440> anyway<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.070> that's<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.340> point<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
out anyway and that's the point of the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.760 
out anyway and that's the point of the
blur<00:02:31.970> application<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:33.020> be<00:02:33.140> able<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.350> create<00:02:33.590> a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
blur application to be able to create a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.410 
blur application to be able to create a
blurry<00:02:34.010> wallpaper<00:02:34.580> seed<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:35.090> doesn't<00:02:35.330> really

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
blurry wallpaper seed it doesn't really

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.940 
blurry wallpaper seed it doesn't really
matter<00:02:35.630> if<00:02:35.900> your<00:02:36.050> picture<00:02:36.260> isn't<00:02:36.530> extremely

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.690 
photograph that I found on a tumblr page
screenshot<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.470> blurred<00:02:45.800> out<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> add<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.580> as

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
screenshot it blurred out and add it as

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.250 
screenshot it blurred out and add it as
the<00:02:46.820> wallpaper<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.360> my<00:02:47.390> device<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.050> think

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the wallpaper on my device and I think

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.600 
the wallpaper on my device and I think
that<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.470> looks<00:02:48.680> really<00:02:48.830> really<00:02:49.100> nice<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
that it looks really really nice and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.400 
that it looks really really nice and
essentially<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.570> how<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.810> make<00:02:50.930> all<00:02:51.320> the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
essentially this is how I make all the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.710 
essentially this is how I make all the
wallpapers<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.070> use<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:52.340> my<00:02:52.550> iOS<00:02:52.880> 7<00:02:53.450> device

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720
