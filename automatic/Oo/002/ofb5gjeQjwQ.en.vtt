00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.700
 Let's talk a little about thermodynamics 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.430
 thermodynamics is a word 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.559
 composed of thermos and dynamic those that 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.660
 means the dynamiter is the branch 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.660
 diverse that writes the states 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.220
 let's just say that thermodynamics 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.380
 it's the science of energy to start 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.309
 to understand it you have to know that everything 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 thermodynamic analysis should be divided into 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.340
 system borders and surroundings the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.960
 system is the volume or mass clearly 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.960
 delimited that is under study 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.200
 the border is what defines the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 system can be real or imaginary 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.100
 the surroundings are everything that is not 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.110
 everything is included in the system 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.850
 thermodynamics there are laws 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.900
 fundamentals that will help us 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.460
 understand it starting with the zero law 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.479
 if two bodies are in balance 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.670
 thermal with a third then these 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.990
 two are in thermal equilibrium with each other 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 then when two bodies have the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.970
 same heat is in balance 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 thermal 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.960
 thermal equilibrium is achieved when 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.390
 two objects reach the same 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.060
 temperature what difference there is between 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.170
 heat and temperature the temperature is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 a measure of kinetic energy 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.760
 average of the particles of a body 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.740
 and heat is the energy in transit of 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.680
 a body of higher temperature to another of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.010
 lower temperature now let's continue with the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.300
 laws the first law of thermodynamics 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.990
 tells us that energy is not created or 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.880
 destroys only transforms is to say the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.130
 energy is preserved 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 in a system in which there is no 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.560
 internal energy variation the energy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.130
 that enters the system will be equal to the one 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.230
 this comes out however in a system in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.230
 which changes occur inside 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.870
 the variation of energy within this 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.340
 is equal to the difference between energy 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.340
 that goes out and the energy that comes in 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.510
 and it is possible to transfer energy from a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.800
 body of lower temperature to one of 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.440
 higher temperature 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.930
 for this we go to the second law of 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.940
 the thermodynamics that limit us certain 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
 processes that are possible to perform 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.770
 only if there is some energy capable of 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.970
 effect a change in the system like the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.970
 I work in the previous example 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.210
 we already saw that while thermodynamics is 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.070
 a complex concept its foundations are 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.900
 can understand and observe all 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.570
 days in all the daily acts that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.750
 you make for example when you heat 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.690
 a house with a paraffin stove the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.270
 thermodynamics is present as there 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.580
 energy transfers and are respected 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.580
 The aforementioned laws 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.410
 active
