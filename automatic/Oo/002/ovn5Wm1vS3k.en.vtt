to be addressed

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.560 
to be addressed
quite<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.649> directly<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.489> blend<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
quite so directly and blend it down it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.189 
quite so directly and blend it down it's
better<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.170> add<00:00:59.149> then<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.390> put<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> dollop<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
better to add then to put a dollop on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.829 
better to add then to put a dollop on
and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.890> try<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> spread<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> around<00:01:02.839> around

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
and then try to spread it around around

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.440 
and then try to spread it around around
the<00:01:04.290> nose<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> big<00:01:05.100> area<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.030> broken

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the nose is a big area a lot of broken

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080 
the nose is a big area a lot of broken
capillaries<00:01:07.230> so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.910> get<00:01:09.060> a

capillaries so you kind of want to get a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.540 
capillaries so you kind of want to get a

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
little heavy-handed with that and then

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.870 
little heavy-handed with that and then
take<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:12.150> clean<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> sponge<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.880> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
take a clean side of the sponge and just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.990 
take a clean side of the sponge and just
feather<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> diffuse<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:15.990> out

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
feather and diffuse it out

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
feather and diffuse it out
you<00:01:18.000> can't<00:01:18.330> blend<00:01:18.750> too<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:20.190> color

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you can't blend too much with color

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.780 
you can't blend too much with color
correctors<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> we've<00:01:22.680> prepped<00:01:23.010> Mary<00:01:23.400> skin

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
flesh out you're going to get a truer

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
flesh out you're going to get a truer
finish<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> foundation<00:01:36.960> since

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
finish and look of the foundation since

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.860 
finish and look of the foundation since
we've<00:01:37.860> neutralized<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.760> red<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> everything

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
then move into the jaw line you might be

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.600 
then move into the jaw line you might be
wondering<00:04:25.050> why<00:04:25.229> we<00:04:25.260> started<00:04:25.919> with<00:04:25.979> green<00:04:26.370> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
wondering why we started with green and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.140 
wondering why we started with green and
now<00:04:26.909> we're<00:04:27.120> moving<00:04:27.450> into<00:04:27.599> yellow<00:04:28.940> Green<00:04:29.940> is

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.250 
now we're moving into yellow Green is
really<00:04:30.479> great<00:04:30.719> as<00:04:30.900> a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
really great as a

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.890 
really great as a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
prep something close to the skin to used

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.100 
prep something close to the skin to used
under<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.490> foundation<00:04:36.150> or<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.420> concealers

it accepts into the skin and and does

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.290 
it accepts into the skin and and does
exactly<00:04:43.860> what<00:04:44.310> we<00:04:44.430> wanted<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.940> do

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
exactly what we wanted it to do

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.590 
exactly what we wanted it to do
neutralize<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.110> red<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.650> then<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:48.090> blend<00:04:48.390> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
neutralize the red and then we blend the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.530 
neutralize the red and then we blend the
foundation<00:04:48.750> over<00:04:49.290> top<00:04:49.910> so<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:50.970> get<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.210> truer

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540
