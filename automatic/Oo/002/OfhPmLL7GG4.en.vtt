00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
a toll on my hair so I came up with

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.860 
a toll on my hair so I came up with
those<00:01:12.580> three<00:01:12.940> items<00:01:13.090> put<00:01:13.600> them<00:01:13.720> together

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
because I used to use all three of them

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.090 
because I used to use all three of them
at<00:01:16.660> different<00:01:16.990> times<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.380> I<00:01:17.530> fuse<00:01:17.950> them

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100

something<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.190> moisture<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
something for the moisture for the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.620 
something for the moisture for the
glycerin<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.140> attract<00:03:02.270> do<00:03:03.270> your<00:03:03.420> research

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
glycerin to attract do your research

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.850 
glycerin to attract do your research
you'll<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.320> that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you'll see that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.580 
you'll see that
listen<00:03:05.670> attracts<00:03:06.090> moisture<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
listen attracts moisture and if it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
listen attracts moisture and if it
doesn't<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:08.190> moisture<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:09.060> attract<00:03:09.600> it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
doesn't have moisture to attract it

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.200 
doesn't have moisture to attract it
starts<00:03:10.230> pulling<00:03:10.530> moisture<00:03:10.830> from<00:03:11.430> whatever

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
starts pulling moisture from whatever

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.520 
starts pulling moisture from whatever
you're<00:03:12.510> putting<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.380> you're

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you're putting it on so if you're

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.680 
you're putting it on so if you're
putting<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.980> your<00:03:14.190> skin<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.820> going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.270> pull

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
putting on your skin is going to pull

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.540 
putting on your skin is going to pull
the<00:03:15.840> moisture<00:03:16.020> away<00:03:16.440> from<00:03:16.650> your<00:03:16.860> skin<00:03:17.070> as
