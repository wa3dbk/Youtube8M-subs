00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.069
 Welcome guys, but I'm going to video today. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.700
 show you what it takes to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 run the top dani advance wars fine right 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.190
 and so what is needed is a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 four-core processor you do not 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.560
 core 2 old-time quad that will take care of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.570
 good and 4gb ram 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.269
 I want to talk 4gb of ram is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 crazy the web language the game seems to 4g 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.680
 it is not enough 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.650
 I 'm going to give the 63 machines and the 314 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.540
 type of strawberry and you will understand why 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.530
 which is catching many machine top 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.940
 right 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.399
 This video is going to be either going to be 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 need to test and different machines and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.989
 at the same time interpret work of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.420
 very cool , beauty 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 I think it's been quite 10 will see right 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 Our first machine here is a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.460
 thirst 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 only 17 zinho 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.239
 it has 4 GB of RAM 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 Look, the frozen ones are giving is more 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 680 eyes of all kinds at 150 200 fps 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.630
 Look, you missed it. 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.189
 These things I'll show you. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.439
 Why are these frozen ones happening? 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 is with 4 GB of RAM 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.970
 If the system has lisinha, you do not have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.369
 much as he was loading do's do 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 process of my video maintenance this 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.759
 video frame now will not be good left 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 part of the right proverb 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.770
 We only talk about it but for four weeks it's 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.040
 working is an insect with 680 is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.360
 locking you up how's it going? 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 staging see here a little move 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.810
 two years fps is recording forró 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 these frozen ones look at what is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 happening 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.540
 the other O impossible to play whatever I just 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.049
 4 GB of ram and I said that it was running 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.630
 opa 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.579
 so you're 17 you have a top plate 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.490
 line that to 180 votes here good 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.020
 I'm going to kill my friends here. 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.009
 once again they just do not understand the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.520
 first move 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.910
 It's just that it is forbidden to appeal or 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.069
 now it's loaded it was now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.069
 go to the call, how did it soften? 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.270
 certain right and wrong 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.220
 Look at the difference, guys. 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.650
 lottery work 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
 Work was the money, look it. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.440
 giving more is much less than manufacturing the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.690
 4 gb of ram right from wrong wrong is right 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.850
 good to prove that it is not the question of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.240
 machine then I'll get another one right 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.760
 which here is with a 5870 also runs 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:48.010
 Quiet this ultra right game all 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:49.750
 machines came back the same fear 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.410
 and stayed 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.940
 He is feeling but science is 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.570
 freezing and talking but it is case 4gb ram 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.630
 right or wrong the wrong guys I 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.580
 I got 27 got the strong club. 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.440
 now I'll get the weak video card 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.060
 here's an average video card more than 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.480
 weak average much weaker than the two 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 in quad core 2 processor which is very 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.930
 ancient then a pretty old plaque plate 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.080
 of 2010 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.660
 the processor is older still the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.920
 memory that I will use is r 2 still and 4 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:31.420
 giga 22 2 700 mega-hertz four gigas 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.220
 speak but he did not play in seventh 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.770
 place strong that 12 is the oldest more 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.710
 soft spot not know looking guys there 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.810
 this is the same game in June or 2 gb of 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.500
 ddr2 ram memory still opel à magna o 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.980
 extract is running at 80 species is a 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.850
 gtx 460 to 65 on the internet 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.670
 looks just returned to heat the wheels there 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.550
 I'm already going to set up the first map. 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.410
 the ice cream is every more sex clothes 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.220
 protected from species of those 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.670
 ancient 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.130
 nothing of which wheels good business of 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.020
 machine is this let's get an idea with 4 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.209
 Gb of ram and switches very quickly I'm going 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.100
 get into the work I do here, me 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.180
 I'm going back in the game, you have to do this. 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.280
 a machine of yours 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.160
 the quarterback will be working now 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.800
 where I wanted 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:28.850
 the play op to prove to you core 2 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.510
 quad with 4 gb of ram 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.760
 The hour that enters our magic looks that 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.220
 beautiful thing 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.660
 this little piece here I'll be in the game a 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 ssd 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.700
 Look at the pt there was notizia yellow that 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.950
 it from r 2 and the core 2 quad to 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.380
 video to gtx 460 looks beautiful thing that 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:54.470
 is 65 well had you talk ah 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.850
 but there is that first machine to 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.900
 first brand would be what after the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.700
 let far 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.300
 it had already preloaded files from the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.710
 hd and daniel I caught only died 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.020
 to know him back down 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.370
 I worked for because I had to 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.860
 upload that information already 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.240
 were stored in the memory at 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.010
 all that scenery that part that 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.350
 have taught you to store memory if you 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.940
 do not have a hd you can do if 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.310
 talk on the block nowadays want to shoot 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.960
 but I'm not going to spend a ssd 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.630
 you can do the following have a video 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.120
 I do maintenance there, I read yu. 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.610
 good part of the system memory the game 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.260
 really need to have at least 3.2 say 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.900
 for him in memory 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.790
 so you have a system with 4gb of 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.590
 memory because you have very little then you 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.300
 will perform a maintenance process on the 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.080
 I did it right there. 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.450
 maintenance 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.060
 after that for you to try to soften 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.640
 this or you put in a secondary hd 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.340
 this fragment to him you put in your 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.130
 hd primary that is in love and separate 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.300
 a partition of the game there whatever it is 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.460
 mental disorder is okay 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.540
 hds were now that you have 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.950
 more of my life 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.350
 I'm sorry, but you 're going to work anyway. 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.810
 up to 16 GB of RAM and will stay 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.700
 locking right and talk but I do not 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.190
 I have this right wheel in the book're 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.710
 you may not have needed are with 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.580
 a lot of ram is with eight gigs 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.200
 up 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.810
 Then there are people with six days to go 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.610
 talk you go there and take file 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.780
 windows paging such that really 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.990
 will solve why you will be able to 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.240
 before loading these game details in the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.680
 your memory is 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.940
 I could not stay with much more 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.580
 stored in my time will not stay 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.710
 carrying every hour of beauty is 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.270
 I hope you liked it, I said it quickly. 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.470
 something that I had not done for a long time 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.389
 I was in a hurry to the forum and beauty 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.849
 This is if you have any questions. 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.370
 touch the tips is this fragments of the 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.800
 work of having a partition organize your 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:51.080
 system because it is necessary to 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:54.470
 organize the system and that's what you're going to do 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.020
 the video is formatting and it has in my 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.030
 channel you sign up for is 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.199
 doubt gives a touch there has proved that a 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.560
 Old machine, man , I do not know. 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:09.440
 another five years he ran the right laugh 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.020
 even though the beauty is much weaker 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.020
 Is this bye, bye, is a video gone?
