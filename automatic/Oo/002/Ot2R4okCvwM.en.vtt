00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

we<00:00:00.390> tried<00:00:00.840> or<00:00:01.350> those<00:00:01.680> that<00:00:01.709> put<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.310> test

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
we tried or those that put the test

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.760 
we tried or those that put the test
together<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:03.149> develop<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.589> could

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
together to develop it so that you could

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.849 
together to develop it so that you could
see<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.160> quality<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.270> writer<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.720> not<00:00:07.470> so

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
see the quality of the writer and not so

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.509 
see the quality of the writer and not so
much<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.460> brilliance<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.540> movement<00:00:10.519> but

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
much the brilliance of the movement but

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850 
much the brilliance of the movement but
some<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> tests<00:00:12.509> are<00:00:12.599> constructed<00:00:13.290> that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
some of the tests are constructed that

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.560 
some of the tests are constructed that
they're<00:00:14.250> wicked<00:00:14.910> hard<00:00:15.619> in<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:18.240> second

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
they're wicked hard in this the second

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.189 
they're wicked hard in this the second
level<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.890> hardest<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.420> so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
level is the hardest one we have and so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.679 
level is the hardest one we have and so
this<00:00:22.380> writer<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.369> brave<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> very<00:00:24.090> game

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
this writer is very brave and very game

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.259 
this writer is very brave and very game
if<00:00:25.140> she<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.560> pull<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.859> off<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.640> impressed

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
if she can pull it off I'm impressed

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.410 
if she can pull it off I'm impressed
yeah<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> emphasis<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.090> met<00:00:33.300> we're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
yeah so the emphasis here if met we're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.990 
yeah so the emphasis here if met we're
almost<00:00:33.660> ready<00:00:33.899> yeah<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.430> focus<00:00:35.820> on

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
almost ready yeah is that we focus on

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
almost ready yeah is that we focus on
the<00:00:36.180> writer<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.410> example<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.010> medium

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the writer so for example the medium

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510 
the writer so for example the medium
trot<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.320> look<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.920> its<00:00:41.219> if

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
trot we're not going to look for its if

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
trot we're not going to look for its if
she<00:00:41.700> does<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.530> she

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
she does we kind of be like what is she

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.240 
she does we kind of be like what is she
doing<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.219> yeah<00:00:45.170> get<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.620> things<00:00:46.649> yeah

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
doing here yeah get on with things yeah

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
doing here yeah get on with things yeah
but<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.480> effect<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> aid<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> how<00:00:49.680> they

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but the effect of the aid and how they

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
but the effect of the aid and how they
go<00:00:50.070> through<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> intent

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
go through and if we can see the intent

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
go through and if we can see the intent
and<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> purpose<00:00:52.410> behind<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.160> being

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and the purpose behind it as being

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.660 
and the purpose behind it as being
correct<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.930> reward<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> we're<00:00:56.340> looking

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
correct then we reward it we're looking

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.360 
correct then we reward it we're looking
for<00:00:57.000> vertical<00:00:57.770> dynamics<00:00:58.770> through<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
for vertical dynamics through the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
for vertical dynamics through the
writers<00:00:59.730> body<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.539> again<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.899> discuss<00:01:01.320> two

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
writers body and again we discuss two

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
writers body and again we discuss two
straight<00:01:02.100> lines<00:01:02.449> your<00:01:03.449> shoulder<00:01:04.080> hip<00:01:04.350> heel

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
straight lines your shoulder hip heel

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.710 
straight lines your shoulder hip heel
and<00:01:05.070> elbow<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:07.260> looking<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
and elbow to bit we're looking for the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
and elbow to bit we're looking for the
effect<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> AIDS<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.100> go

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
effect of the AIDS and how they go

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.170 
effect of the AIDS and how they go
through<00:01:11.810> invisibly<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> horse<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.280> let's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
through invisibly to the horse so let's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
through invisibly to the horse so let's
watch<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> enjoy<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:18.290> will<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.470> say<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
watch and enjoy I will just say in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
watch and enjoy I will just say in the
judges<00:01:20.549> position<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:22.380> tests<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.299> horrendous

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
judges position the tests are horrendous

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.070 
judges position the tests are horrendous
to<00:01:24.840> write<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.340> full<00:01:26.670> page<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.659> side

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to write on it's a full page on one side

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800 
to write on it's a full page on one side
of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.710> test<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.210> side<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of the test and on the other side you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.300 
of the test and on the other side you
have<00:01:31.020> three<00:01:31.380> inches<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.549> write<00:01:32.729> notes<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.259> and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
have three inches to write notes on and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
have three inches to write notes on and
there<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.640> many<00:01:35.790> boxes<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.650> been<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there are so many boxes that it's been a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
there are so many boxes that it's been a
struggle<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
struggle and I know that it's going to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.270 
struggle and I know that it's going to
be<00:01:40.500> improved<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.490> developed<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.829> again<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
be improved in developed but again a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:02:01.710 
be improved in developed but again a
challenging<00:01:45.180> test

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.890 

so<00:02:02.560> she's<00:02:03.100> going<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.730> do<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> prescribed<00:02:04.480> test

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
so she's going to do a prescribed test

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.490 
so she's going to do a prescribed test
it's<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.710> same<00:02:05.950> all<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> time<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
it's the same all the time but the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's the same all the time but the
dialogue<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.250> have<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:09.820> my<00:02:10.060> scribe<00:02:10.479> here

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
dialogue that I have with my scribe here

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.580 
dialogue that I have with my scribe here
isn't<00:02:11.620> about<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.190> test<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.930> back<00:02:14.140> side<00:02:14.530> of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
isn't about the test on the back side of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.070 
isn't about the test on the back side of
the<00:02:14.860> test<00:02:15.100> we<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.670> boxes<00:02:16.480> as<00:02:16.870> we've

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the test we have boxes as we've

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.560 
the test we have boxes as we've
discussed<00:02:17.500> about<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.130> vertical<00:02:18.760> dynamics<00:02:19.330> of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
discussed about the vertical dynamics of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.490 
discussed about the vertical dynamics of
the<00:02:19.840> riders<00:02:20.080> body<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:22.300> effect<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.290> aides

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the riders body the effect of the aides

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.700 
the riders body the effect of the aides
how<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.220> horse<00:02:24.640> understands<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
how the horse understands it the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.420 
how the horse understands it the
accuracy<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.280> figures<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:32.430> harmony

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
accuracy of the figures and the harmony

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.230 
accuracy of the figures and the harmony
as<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.660> pair<00:02:34.900> goes<00:02:35.140> along<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.459> we're<00:02:36.700> watching

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
as the pair goes along so we're watching
