00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
colors they're not worn around your
wrists<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> guess<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.899> tech<00:00:55.110> terminology<00:00:55.770> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
wrists so I guess my tech terminology is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
wrists so I guess my tech terminology is
wrong<00:00:55.980> rather<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:57.030> worn<00:00:57.390> around<00:00:57.629> your

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
wrong rather they're worn around your

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
wrong rather they're worn around your
palm<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> color<00:00:59.789> facing<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
palm like this with the color facing and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
palm like this with the color facing and
it's<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> plastic<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:01.949> notice<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's just a plastic you don't notice it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's just a plastic you don't notice it
much<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> ball<00:01:03.719> itself<00:01:04.170> does

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
much at all but the ball itself does

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.130 
much at all but the ball itself does
there's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> button<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> ball<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> turn<00:01:06.060> on

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.090 

so<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.320> playing<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.619> game<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> pass

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so when you're playing a game you pass

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
so when you're playing a game you pass
it<00:01:14.280> each<00:01:14.400> player<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> catch<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> knows

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it each player as you catch it it knows

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.630 
it each player as you catch it it knows
what<00:01:16.920> color<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.340> I'll<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
what color you are and then I'll just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.950 
what color you are and then I'll just
use<00:01:23.729> black<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.299> orange<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.840> two

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
use black and orange for the other two

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.100 
use black and orange for the other two
players<00:01:32.030> once<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> players<00:01:33.720> picked

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
players once you have the players picked

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
players once you have the players picked
and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:34.860> three<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> six

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
and you can play from three to six
players<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.450> choose<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.720> game<00:01:37.400> for<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and then each time it's counting how

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then each time it's counting how
many<00:01:59.250> times<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.790> pass<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.360> forth

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
until eventually green gets their hands

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:14.300 
until eventually green gets their hands
on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> ball

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.690 

if<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.120> want<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.540> play<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.110> different<00:02:16.440> game<00:02:19.700> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
if you want to play a different game and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.309 
if you want to play a different game and
so<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.690> game<00:02:21.810> keeps<00:02:22.050> playing

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319

like that the other game is monkey in

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.370 
like that the other game is monkey in
the<00:02:23.730> middle<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.209> minute<00:02:24.540> session<00:02:24.959> where<00:02:25.319> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the middle one minute session where you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
the middle one minute session where you
basically<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> pass<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> back<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.910> forth

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
basically have to pass it back and forth

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.820 
basically have to pass it back and forth
as<00:02:27.209> fast<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.599> can<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.410> don't<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.709> it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
as fast as you can if you don't do it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.729 
as fast as you can if you don't do it
fast<00:02:29.069> enough<00:02:29.280> eventually<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:31.380> run<00:02:31.530> out<00:02:31.590> of

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
fast enough eventually you run out of

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.640 
fast enough eventually you run out of
time<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.930> third<00:02:33.959> game<00:02:34.470> which

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
time and then the the third game which

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.260 
time and then the the third game which
is<00:02:34.770> only<00:02:34.920> possible<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.459> four<00:02:35.760> players<00:02:35.910> or

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
is only possible with four players or

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.720 
is only possible with four players or
more<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.630> basically<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> team<00:02:37.860> game<00:02:38.100> rules<00:02:38.489> put

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
more is basically a team game rules put

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
more is basically a team game rules put
you<00:02:38.819> up<00:02:38.940> into<00:02:39.090> two<00:02:39.270> teams<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.319> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you up into two teams and you have to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.259 
you up into two teams and you have to
pass<00:02:40.620> back<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:40.950> forth<00:02:41.190> as<00:02:41.519> many<00:02:41.700> times<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.150> you

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
pass back and forth as many times as you

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.509 
pass back and forth as many times as you
can<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> other<00:02:43.769> team<00:02:43.950> intercepts<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
can and if the other team intercepts it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.580 
can and if the other team intercepts it
it<00:02:44.640> will<00:02:44.730> count<00:02:44.910> down<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.480> them<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.410> team

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
it will count down for them so one team

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
it will count down for them so one team
will<00:02:46.769> have<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:46.920> noise<00:02:47.430> every<00:02:47.850> time<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.120> pass

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
will have one noise every time they pass

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.699 
will have one noise every time they pass
it<00:02:48.540> back<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.690> forth<00:02:48.870> another<00:02:49.290> team<00:02:49.470> will<00:02:49.620> have

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
it back and forth another team will have

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
it back and forth another team will have
another<00:02:49.950> noise<00:02:50.190> now<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.269> possible<00:02:51.480> if

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
another noise now it is possible if

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.970 
another noise now it is possible if
you're<00:02:51.870> holding<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.410> ball<00:02:52.560> too<00:02:52.739> long
