00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
obviously when in the championship was a

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.150 
obviously when in the championship was a
big<00:00:01.680> one<00:00:01.800> being<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.879> inaugural<00:00:03.300> season<00:00:03.510> and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
big one being the inaugural season and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.309 
big one being the inaugural season and
we<00:00:05.160> had<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> run<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.580> wins<00:00:05.910> they're<00:00:06.330> starting<00:00:07.259> I

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
we had a run of wins they're starting I

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.520 
we had a run of wins they're starting I
think<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.620> barber<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:09.139> made<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.349> pretty

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
think at barber that made it a pretty

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.770 
think at barber that made it a pretty
special<00:00:10.920> year<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:12.210> down<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.540> last

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
special year and going down to the last

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.060 
special year and going down to the last
race<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> season<00:00:13.380> which<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.799> time<00:00:13.889> I

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
race of the season which at that time I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.180 
race of the season which at that time I
think<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.490> Daytona<00:00:14.940> finale<00:00:16.190> battling

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
think was the Daytona finale battling

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.300 
think was the Daytona finale battling
with<00:00:17.310> Donahue<00:00:17.750> from<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> start<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
with Donahue from the start and and then

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.099 
with Donahue from the start and and then
having<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> pretty<00:00:20.730> dominant<00:00:21.000> car<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
having a pretty dominant car for the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.070 
having a pretty dominant car for the
rest<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> race<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.869> good

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
rest of the race was was was a good

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.839 
rest of the race was was was a good
feeling<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.010> mean<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> look<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> lap

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
feeling you mean if you look at the lap

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.970 
feeling you mean if you look at the lap
times<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.539> far<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:27.990> fast<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> cars<00:00:28.710> were

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
times as far as how fast the cars were

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.429 
times as far as how fast the cars were
in<00:00:29.250> 03<00:00:29.400> even<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> straightaway<00:00:30.929> speed<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
in 03 even the straightaway speed is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100 
in 03 even the straightaway speed is
just<00:00:31.710> mind-boggling<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> what

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
just mind-boggling from what it is what

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.819 
just mind-boggling from what it is what
it<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.320> then<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> now<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.829> that's

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it was then to what it is now and that's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.610 
it was then to what it is now and that's
why<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> year's<00:00:38.730> 2010<00:00:39.690> rolex<00:00:40.469> 24

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
why I think this year's 2010 rolex 24

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
why I think this year's 2010 rolex 24
was<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> special<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.850> me<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:42.989> you

in<00:01:25.200> 2003<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> special<00:01:26.490> accomplishment<00:01:27.240> for

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
in 2003 was a special accomplishment for

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.399 
in 2003 was a special accomplishment for
sure<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> gym<00:01:30.270> France<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
sure I think that the gym France and and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
sure I think that the gym France and and
those<00:01:31.920> involved<00:01:32.520> from<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> beginning<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
those involved from the beginning of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
those involved from the beginning of
Grand<00:01:33.960> Am<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:35.130> well-thought-out

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Grand Am had a very well-thought-out

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.600 
Grand Am had a very well-thought-out
plan<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.439> they're<00:01:37.619> sticking<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
plan and I think they're sticking to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
plan and I think they're sticking to
that<00:01:38.759> plan<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.560> evolved<00:01:41.040> well

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that plan I think that it's evolved well

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
that plan I think that it's evolved well
i<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> participation<00:01:43.409> has

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
i think that the participation has

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
i think that the participation has
probably<00:01:44.100> exceeded<00:01:44.670> their<00:01:44.850> expectations

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
probably exceeded their expectations

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080 
probably exceeded their expectations
especially<00:01:45.840> early<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> bottom<00:01:48.060> line

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
especially early on but the bottom line

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
especially early on but the bottom line
is<00:01:48.270> people<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.869> want<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> place<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.560> able

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is people just want a place to be able

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
is people just want a place to be able
to<00:01:49.799> race<00:01:49.979> competitively<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.729> mean<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.090> want

like<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> open<00:02:08.970> cockpit<00:02:09.660> prototypes<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> old

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
like the open cockpit prototypes the old

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
like the open cockpit prototypes the old
prototypes<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> DP<00:02:11.849> cars<00:02:12.120> are<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.959> know

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
prototypes but the DP cars are you know

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
prototypes but the DP cars are you know
anytime<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
anytime you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
DP cars have really come a long way and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.220 
DP cars have really come a long way and
a<00:02:23.460> lot<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.060> engineers<00:02:24.510> are<00:02:24.750> using<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a lot of the engineers are using the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.080 
a lot of the engineers are using the
trays<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> bottom<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.460> lot<00:02:26.910> more

the cars to fly and that's that's that's
really<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> key<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.400> getting<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.760> car

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
really the key is getting that car

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.820 
really the key is getting that car
working<00:02:33.300> right<00:02:33.630> through<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.990> air<00:02:34.170> using<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
working right through the air using the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.020 
working right through the air using the
tray<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.870> being<00:02:37.740> able<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> thing<00:02:38.310> as

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
tray and being able to get that thing as

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.490 
tray and being able to get that thing as
good<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.380> lot

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
of really good drivers out there a lot

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.760 
of really good drivers out there a lot
of<00:02:41.910> really<00:02:42.270> good<00:02:42.390> teams<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.410> got<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.680> have

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
of really good teams so you got to have

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.280 
of really good teams so you got to have
everything<00:02:43.980> right
