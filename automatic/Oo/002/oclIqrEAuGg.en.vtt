here and we're gonna do a quick
follow-up<00:00:13.150> video<00:00:13.570> I<00:00:13.600> just<00:00:13.690> covered<00:00:14.410> how<00:00:15.100> to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
follow-up video I just covered how to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.800 
follow-up video I just covered how to
develop<00:00:15.670> a<00:00:15.789> cold<00:00:16.030> weather<00:00:16.240> or<00:00:16.449> winter

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
develop a cold weather or winter

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.109 
develop a cold weather or winter
clothing<00:00:17.080> system<00:00:17.680> and<00:00:18.039> in<00:00:18.430> this<00:00:18.520> video<00:00:18.730> we

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
clothing system and in this video we

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.349 
clothing system and in this video we
want<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.360> talk<00:00:19.420> about<00:00:20.429> breathability<00:00:21.429> of<00:00:22.029> some

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
want to talk about breathability of some

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.829 
want to talk about breathability of some
of<00:00:22.509> your<00:00:22.720> different<00:00:23.529> layers<00:00:23.740> and<00:00:24.570> how<00:00:25.570> that

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
of your different layers and how that

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.560 
of your different layers and how that
comes<00:00:26.140> into<00:00:26.380> play<00:00:26.589> in<00:00:26.859> determining<00:00:26.980> which

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
comes into play in determining which

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.730 
comes into play in determining which
jacket<00:00:28.570> or<00:00:28.810> mid<00:00:29.019> layer<00:00:29.199> you're<00:00:29.380> gonna<00:00:29.470> bring

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
jacket or mid layer you're gonna bring

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.010 
jacket or mid layer you're gonna bring
with<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:30.130> depending<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.060> what<00:00:31.570> activity

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
with you depending on what activity

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.260 
with you depending on what activity
you're<00:00:32.230> you're<00:00:32.619> gonna<00:00:33.579> be<00:00:33.760> doing<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.180> what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
you're you're gonna be doing and what

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.119 
you're you're gonna be doing and what
the<00:00:34.450> temperature<00:00:34.960> is<00:00:34.990> yeah<00:00:35.739> different

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
the temperature is yeah different

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.830 
the temperature is yeah different
membranes<00:00:36.489> are<00:00:36.699> gonna<00:00:36.820> actually<00:00:37.030> debris<00:00:37.719> the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
membranes are gonna actually debris the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.029 
membranes are gonna actually debris the
village<00:00:38.050> in<00:00:38.140> effect<00:00:38.410> how<00:00:38.559> warm<00:00:38.860> they<00:00:39.010> are

village in effect how warm they are

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.340 
village in effect how warm they are
something<00:00:39.879> like<00:00:40.000> gore-tex<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.960> doesn't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
something like gore-tex that doesn't

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.750 
something like gore-tex that doesn't
really<00:00:41.949> have<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.160> greatest<00:00:42.609> air

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
permeability it's gonna trap a little

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.319 
permeability it's gonna trap a little
bit<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.949> microclimate<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.850> preserve<00:00:46.300> a

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
bit of a microclimate and preserve a

little bit more body heat over something

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.060 
little bit more body heat over something
like<00:00:48.879> an<00:00:49.120> event<00:00:49.449> or<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.719> neo<00:00:50.379> shell<00:00:50.710> which<00:00:50.949> is

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
like an event or a neo shell which is

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.130 
like an event or a neo shell which is
gonna<00:00:51.190> breathe<00:00:51.519> incredibly<00:00:52.210> well<00:00:52.329> trap<00:00:52.750> very

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
gonna breathe incredibly well trap very

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.439 
gonna breathe incredibly well trap very
little<00:00:53.410> humidity<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.100> have<00:00:54.760> very<00:00:55.059> little<00:00:55.239> the

little humidity and have very little the
microclimate<00:00:56.140> created<00:00:56.590> right<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:57.879> think

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
microclimate created right and I think

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.360 
microclimate created right and I think
you<00:00:58.780> know<00:00:58.840> Brad<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.350> represent<00:00:59.590> two<00:01:00.190> it

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
you know Brad and I represent two it

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.840 
you know Brad and I represent two it
oxidants<00:01:01.179> of<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.390> spectrum<00:01:01.929> in<00:01:02.079> terms<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
oxidants of a spectrum in terms of you

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.040 
oxidants of a spectrum in terms of you
know<00:01:04.000> what<00:01:04.809> clothing<00:01:05.440> layers<00:01:05.830> we<00:01:06.250> would<00:01:07.050> use

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
know what clothing layers we would use

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.490 
know what clothing layers we would use
on<00:01:08.470> any<00:01:08.860> given<00:01:09.160> activity<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:11.170> know<00:01:11.230> if<00:01:11.290> we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
on any given activity you know if we're

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.190 
on any given activity you know if we're
climbing<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.070> same<00:01:12.310> route<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:13.030> tend<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.050> be

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
climbing the same route I tend to be

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.890 
climbing the same route I tend to be
dressed<00:01:14.500> far<00:01:14.830> warmer<00:01:15.370> than<00:01:15.670> Brad<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.420> simply

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
dressed far warmer than Brad is simply

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.170 
dressed far warmer than Brad is simply
because<00:01:17.050> that's<00:01:17.410> my<00:01:17.710> physiology<00:01:18.250> as<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:18.940> tend

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
because that's my physiology as I tend

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.840 
because that's my physiology as I tend
to<00:01:19.270> get<00:01:19.450> cold<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.890> actually<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.370> jacket

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
to get cold so this is actually a jacket

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.400 
to get cold so this is actually a jacket
I<00:01:21.910> was<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.270> wearing<00:01:22.510> in<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> previous<00:01:23.260> video

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
I was just wearing in the previous video

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.000 
I was just wearing in the previous video
it<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.370> gore-tex<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.840> don't<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:26.740> all<00:01:26.980> my

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
it is gore-tex I don't use it for all my

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.980 
it is gore-tex I don't use it for all my
activities<00:01:27.640> but<00:01:27.730> I<00:01:27.790> do<00:01:27.910> use<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.480> for<00:01:28.780> ice

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
activities but I do use it for ice

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.720 
activities but I do use it for ice
climbing<00:01:29.320> simply<00:01:29.800> because<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.130> tend<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.550> get

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
climbing simply because I tend to get

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.110 
climbing simply because I tend to get
pretty<00:01:31.510> cold<00:01:31.780> when<00:01:32.110> I'm<00:01:32.230> right<00:01:32.440> next<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
pretty cold when I'm right next to the

you're<00:01:52.840> climbing<00:01:53.020> putting<00:01:53.470> out<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> lot<00:01:53.740> of

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you're climbing putting out a lot of

you're climbing putting out a lot of
physical<00:01:54.160> exertion<00:01:54.430> then<00:01:55.180> stopping<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.750> blame

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.440 
physical exertion then stopping to blame
me<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.640> need<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.760> extra<00:01:57.940> little<00:01:58.270> bit<00:01:58.420> of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
me you need that extra little bit of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.880 
me you need that extra little bit of
warmth<00:01:58.720> retention<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.200> jacket<00:01:59.530> does<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.740> good

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
warmth retention this jacket does a good

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.440 
warmth retention this jacket does a good
job<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.340> that's<00:02:00.520> what<00:02:00.700> Brad's<00:02:00.940> referring

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
job of that that's what Brad's referring

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.300 
job of that that's what Brad's referring
to<00:02:01.600> me<00:02:01.720> says<00:02:01.930> flash<00:02:02.230> on<00:02:02.500> flash<00:02:02.800> off<00:02:03.070> you're

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
to me says flash on flash off you're

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.150 
to me says flash on flash off you're
going<00:02:03.460> from<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.090> period<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.870> high<00:02:05.170> exertion<00:02:05.950> to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
going from a period of high exertion to

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.029 
going from a period of high exertion to
a<00:02:06.610> period<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.000> no<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.720> very<00:02:07.750> little<00:02:08.020> additional

a period of no or very little additional

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.010 
a period of no or very little additional
and<00:02:09.280> what<00:02:10.030> we're<00:02:10.119> gonna<00:02:10.209> do<00:02:10.360> here<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
and what we're gonna do here this is the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.259 
and what we're gonna do here this is the
bubbler<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.400> little<00:02:12.549> test<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.000> uses<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
bubbler that's a little test that uses a

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.520 
bubbler that's a little test that uses a
little<00:02:13.510> bit<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.689> air<00:02:13.780> pressure<00:02:13.959> underneath

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
little bit of air pressure underneath

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
little bit of air pressure underneath
the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.449 
the
to<00:02:16.110> show<00:02:16.290> how<00:02:16.500> truly<00:02:16.830> breathable<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:19.459> membrane

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
to show how truly breathable a membrane

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.670 
to show how truly breathable a membrane
is<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.599> basically<00:02:21.870> we're<00:02:22.019> gonna<00:02:22.079> set<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.470> on

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
is so basically we're gonna set this on

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.550 
is so basically we're gonna set this on
here<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.189> pour<00:02:24.000> water<00:02:24.239> over<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:25.110> top<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.319> this

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
here and pour water over the top of this

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
here and pour water over the top of this
membrane<00:02:25.939> to<00:02:26.939> show<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:29.400> bubbles<00:02:29.730> coming

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
membrane to show you the bubbles coming

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.069 
membrane to show you the bubbles coming
through<00:02:32.180> that's<00:02:33.180> right<00:02:33.450> tip<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.720> camera

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
through that's right tip the camera

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.920 
through that's right tip the camera
forward<00:02:34.470> here<00:02:35.510> let<00:02:36.510> me<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.720> when<00:02:36.840> you're

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
forward here let me know when you're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350 
forward here let me know when you're
ready<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.260> start<00:02:37.530> taking<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.099> at<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.430> I'm

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
ready to start taking a look at this I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
ready to start taking a look at this I'm
gonna<00:02:39.480> push<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.440> edges<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.829> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
gonna push down on the edges here just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.170 
gonna push down on the edges here just
to<00:02:41.099> make<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.430> there's<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.670> tight<00:02:41.879> seal<00:02:42.150> around

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to make sure there's a tight seal around

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720 
to make sure there's a tight seal around
the<00:02:42.540> whole<00:02:42.750> thing<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:44.069> using<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.519> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the whole thing and I'm using this to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.149 
the whole thing and I'm using this to
show<00:02:44.909> you<00:02:44.939> how<00:02:45.090> readable<00:02:45.989> gore-tex<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.739> or<00:02:47.010> how

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
show you how readable gore-tex is or how

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.000 
show you how readable gore-tex is or how
air<00:02:47.340> permeable<00:02:48.349> right<00:02:49.349> now<00:02:49.470> there's<00:02:49.709> nothing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
air permeable right now there's nothing

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.130 
air permeable right now there's nothing
coming<00:02:50.519> through<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.120> breathes<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.720> zero

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
coming through so this breathes at zero

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.220 
coming through so this breathes at zero
point<00:02:52.590> zero<00:02:53.090> CFM<00:02:54.090> cubic<00:02:54.450> feet<00:02:54.720> per<00:02:54.900> minute<00:02:54.930> of

air<00:02:55.319> through<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> membrane<00:02:56.129> there's<00:02:56.940> nothing

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
air through the membrane there's nothing

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.580 
air through the membrane there's nothing
going<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.659> there<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.019> basically<00:02:58.349> turning

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
going on there just basically turning

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.960 
going on there just basically turning
itself<00:02:58.920> into<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> drum<00:02:59.670> head<00:03:01.609> alright<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
itself into a drum head alright so that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.569 
itself into a drum head alright so that
was<00:03:03.079> gore-tex<00:03:04.079> which<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.280> want<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
was gore-tex which one do you want it

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:13.520 
was gore-tex which one do you want it
next<00:03:05.700> bad<00:03:06.000> let's<00:03:06.420> try<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.599> event<00:03:06.930> show<00:03:12.530> this

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
next bad let's try the event show this

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
next bad let's try the event show this
is<00:03:13.739> another<00:03:14.069> jacket<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:14.970> mine<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.480> use

let's do it it's a rad super goo they

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.909 
let's do it it's a rad super goo they
don't<00:03:18.720> make<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.900> anymore<00:03:19.109> but<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.739> good

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
don't make it anymore but it's a good

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:28.640 
don't make it anymore but it's a good

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
this tight as we get a good seal here I

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.970 
this tight as we get a good seal here I
may<00:03:31.379> have<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.590> made<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.859> worse<00:03:32.569> there<00:03:33.569> we<00:03:33.629> go

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
may have just made it worse there we go

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.650 
may have just made it worse there we go
and<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.190> pretty<00:03:35.400> remarkable<00:03:35.609> how<00:03:36.209> I'll

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and this is pretty remarkable how I'll

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.680 
and this is pretty remarkable how I'll

breed the bull event is in comparison to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.960 
breed the bull event is in comparison to
gore-tex<00:03:40.139> if<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.190> were<00:03:41.280> gonna<00:03:41.370> send<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.760> guide

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.390 
out in the mountains for 300 out of 365
days<00:03:45.449> we'd<00:03:46.410> probably<00:03:46.590> choose<00:03:46.949> gore-tex

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
days we'd probably choose gore-tex

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.099 
days we'd probably choose gore-tex
because<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.760> membrane<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.239> less<00:03:48.480> fouled<00:03:48.780> by

you being inside it event is a wash off
in<00:03:51.870> peace<00:03:52.109> because<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> pores<00:03:52.799> are<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.220> big

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
in peace because the pores are so big

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.339 
in peace because the pores are so big
and<00:03:53.549> breathable<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.299> tends<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.049> get<00:03:55.169> fouled

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
and breathable that tends to get fouled

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.129 
and breathable that tends to get fouled
by<00:03:55.530> your<00:03:55.680> body<00:03:55.859> oils<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.340> sweat<00:03:56.489> salt<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.109> that

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
by your body oils and sweat salt so that

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.809 
by your body oils and sweat salt so that
is<00:03:58.470> actually<00:03:58.829> air<00:03:58.949> coming<00:03:59.220> through<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.639> back

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
is actually air coming through the back

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.939 
is actually air coming through the back
side<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.329> membrane<00:04:00.620> no<00:04:01.620> phase<00:04:01.919> change

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
needed at all to move that humid air

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.920 
needed at all to move that humid air
directly<00:04:05.069> through<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> jacket<00:04:05.699> now<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.510> this

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
directly through the jacket now and this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.059 
directly through the jacket now and this
is<00:04:07.199> a<00:04:07.790> perfect<00:04:08.790> example<00:04:08.879> of<00:04:09.299> why<00:04:09.889> event<00:04:10.889> is

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is a perfect example of why event is

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.229 
is a perfect example of why event is
less<00:04:11.340> warm<00:04:12.199> over<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.290> gore-tex<00:04:13.680> membrane<00:04:14.239> now

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.199 
less warm over the gore-tex membrane now
I<00:04:15.599> think<00:04:16.199> everyone<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:17.280> shop<00:04:17.549> that's

comparison to event you don't see a lot
you<00:05:17.810> don't<00:05:17.960> see<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.110> micro<00:05:18.560> amount<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:18.919> bubbles

you don't see a micro amount of bubbles

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.430 
you don't see a micro amount of bubbles
coming<00:05:19.460> through<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:19.729> you<00:05:19.820> do<00:05:19.940> at<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.120> event

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
coming through like you do at the event

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.200 
coming through like you do at the event
but<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.530> polyurethane<00:05:22.160> membrane<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:23.150> a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
but this polyurethane membrane is a

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.810 
but this polyurethane membrane is a
thousand<00:05:23.810> percent<00:05:24.169> more<00:05:24.410> breathable<00:05:24.919> then

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
thousand percent more breathable then

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.730 
thousand percent more breathable then
event<00:05:26.360> membrane<00:05:26.690> itself<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.229> it<00:05:27.289> is<00:05:27.410> just

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
event membrane itself and it is just

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.460 
event membrane itself and it is just
ridiculously<00:05:28.610> quick<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.270> this<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.200> actually

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
ridiculously quick and this is actually

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.779 
ridiculously quick and this is actually
a<00:05:30.500> two-way<00:05:30.740> breathable<00:05:31.310> membrane<00:05:31.460> so<00:05:31.729> I'm

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
a two-way breathable membrane so I'm

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:32.830 
a two-way breathable membrane so I'm
gonna<00:05:31.880> try<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.090> get<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.240> bubble<00:05:32.419> to<00:05:32.660> come

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
gonna try and get a bubble to come

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.690 
gonna try and get a bubble to come
partially<00:05:33.440> partially<00:05:33.770> way<00:05:34.039> through<00:05:34.400> the

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
partially partially way through the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.400 
partially partially way through the
membrane<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.270> it'll<00:05:35.930> pull<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.229> back<00:05:36.410> in<00:05:38.410> so

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
membrane and it'll pull it back in so

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.779 
membrane and it'll pull it back in so
see<00:05:39.620> those<00:05:39.710> bubbles<00:05:39.889> right<00:05:40.190> at<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.370> top<00:05:40.550> there

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
see those bubbles right at the top there

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.830

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.890 
we're talking about breathability shall
we<00:06:00.530> quickly<00:06:01.010> discuss<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:02.270> differences<00:06:02.720> in

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
we quickly discuss the differences in

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.659 
we quickly discuss the differences in
Windstopper<00:06:03.349> old<00:06:03.800> versus<00:06:04.250> new<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.430> wind

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
Windstopper old versus new a wind

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.580 
Windstopper old versus new a wind
stopper<00:06:05.090> yes<00:06:05.510> we<00:06:05.990> have

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
stopper yes we have

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.360 
stopper yes we have
that<00:06:08.220> means<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.610> new<00:06:08.760> wind<00:06:09.060> suffered<00:06:09.420> es<00:06:13.370> gosh

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
that means the new wind suffered es gosh

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.100 
that means the new wind suffered es gosh
I<00:06:14.520> wish<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:14.790> had<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.090> old<00:06:15.240> wind<00:06:15.480> stopper<00:06:15.780> event

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
I wish I had the old wind stopper event

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.440 
I wish I had the old wind stopper event
a<00:06:16.440> little<00:06:17.100> tough<00:06:17.280> to<00:06:17.400> believe<00:06:17.490> as<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:17.970> say<00:06:18.240> the

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
a little tough to believe as to say the

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.270 
a little tough to believe as to say the
old<00:06:18.570> wind<00:06:18.840> stopper<00:06:19.110> did<00:06:19.380> not<00:06:19.560> breathe<00:06:19.890> at<00:06:20.100> all

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
old wind stopper did not breathe at all

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.660 
old wind stopper did not breathe at all
no<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:20.850> old<00:06:21.000> wind<00:06:21.180> stopper<00:06:21.480> really<00:06:22.670> really

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
no the old wind stopper really really

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.580 
no the old wind stopper really really
did<00:06:23.790> not<00:06:23.910> breathe<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.390> this<00:06:24.540> is<00:06:24.690> an<00:06:24.810> e<00:06:24.930> PTFE

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
did not breathe and this is an e PTFE

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.460 
did not breathe and this is an e PTFE
membrane<00:06:26.090> underneath<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.930> face<00:06:28.080> fabric<00:06:28.290> here

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
membrane underneath the face fabric here

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.350 
membrane underneath the face fabric here
so<00:06:28.710> basically<00:06:28.910> this<00:06:29.910> is<00:06:29.970> event<00:06:30.420> membrane

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
so basically this is event membrane

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.940 
so basically this is event membrane
construction<00:06:33.470> gore-tex<00:06:34.470> and<00:06:34.560> events<00:06:34.860> are

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
construction gore-tex and events are

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.410 
construction gore-tex and events are
very<00:06:34.980> similar<00:06:35.430> they<00:06:35.610> just<00:06:35.790> leave<00:06:36.210> off<00:06:36.390> a

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
very similar they just leave off a

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.850 
very similar they just leave off a
polyurethane<00:06:36.840> layer<00:06:37.350> what<00:06:37.590> they<00:06:37.650> call<00:06:37.800> an

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
polyurethane layer what they call an

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.400 
polyurethane layer what they call an
oleophobic<00:06:38.160> layer<00:06:38.790> on<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.810> event<00:06:40.080> to<00:06:40.170> make<00:06:40.290> it

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
oleophobic layer on the event to make it

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.960 
oleophobic layer on the event to make it
more<00:06:40.500> breathable<00:06:40.980> and<00:06:41.190> that's<00:06:41.610> all<00:06:41.790> they've

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
more breathable and that's all they've

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.940 
more breathable and that's all they've
done<00:06:42.000> with<00:06:42.270> this<00:06:42.390> gore-tex<00:06:42.900> when<00:06:43.560> stopper

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
done with this gore-tex when stopper

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.870 
done with this gore-tex when stopper
piece<00:06:44.130> so<00:06:44.970> this<00:06:45.120> is<00:06:45.270> Gore<00:06:45.480> Windstopper<00:06:46.880> which

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
piece so this is Gore Windstopper which

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.760 
piece so this is Gore Windstopper which
doesn't<00:06:48.210> breathe<00:06:48.390> you<00:06:49.020> know<00:06:49.080> as<00:06:49.230> well<00:06:49.470> as<00:06:49.620> the

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
doesn't breathe you know as well as the

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.100 
doesn't breathe you know as well as the
neo<00:06:49.920> shell<00:06:50.220> but<00:06:50.790> boy<00:06:50.970> it<00:06:51.120> does<00:06:51.270> it<00:06:51.690> does<00:06:51.900> show

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
neo shell but boy it does it does show

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.660 
neo shell but boy it does it does show
air<00:06:52.320> permeability<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:53.040> it<00:06:53.190> does<00:06:53.370> breathe

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
air permeability and it does breathe

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.210 
air permeability and it does breathe
very<00:06:53.700> well<00:06:54.500> whereas<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.710> previous

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
very well whereas the previous

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.650 
very well whereas the previous
generation<00:06:56.700> of<00:06:56.790> wind<00:06:56.970> stopper<00:06:57.360> which<00:06:57.480> they

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
generation of wind stopper which they

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.380 
generation of wind stopper which they
don't<00:06:57.930> designate<00:06:58.710> that<00:06:58.920> via<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.520> labeling<00:06:59.970> no

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
don't designate that via the labeling no

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.480 
don't designate that via the labeling no
at<00:07:00.870> all<00:07:01.050> are<00:07:01.230> the<00:07:01.350> naming<00:07:01.770> anyway<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.310> hang
