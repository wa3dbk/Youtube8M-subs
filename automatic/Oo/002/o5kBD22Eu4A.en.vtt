final thoughts on it so now let's break

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.439 
final thoughts on it so now let's break
this<00:00:15.190> watch<00:00:15.370> up<00:00:15.519> into<00:00:15.700> two<00:00:15.850> pieces<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.269> we'll

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
this watch up into two pieces and we'll

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.779 
this watch up into two pieces and we'll
start<00:00:16.689> by<00:00:17.140> talking<00:00:17.199> about<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.980> band<00:00:18.220> now<00:00:18.730> the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
start by talking about the band now the

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.999 
start by talking about the band now the
band<00:00:19.029> has<00:00:19.749> a<00:00:19.779> particular<00:00:20.470> coating<00:00:20.740> on<00:00:20.980> here

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
band has a particular coating on here

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.249 
band has a particular coating on here
that<00:00:21.699> actually<00:00:22.210> does<00:00:22.659> a<00:00:22.689> couple<00:00:22.929> different

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
that actually does a couple different

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.810 
that actually does a couple different
things<00:00:23.289> one<00:00:23.769> it's<00:00:23.980> a<00:00:24.039> little<00:00:24.669> bit

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
things one it's a little bit

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.669 
things one it's a little bit
water-resistant<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:25.839> it<00:00:26.230> makes<00:00:26.409> it<00:00:26.529> a<00:00:26.560> bit

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
water-resistant and it makes it a bit

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.679 
water-resistant and it makes it a bit
more<00:00:26.710> smooth<00:00:27.189> but<00:00:27.730> it<00:00:27.819> also<00:00:27.939> doesn't<00:00:28.300> wear

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
more smooth but it also doesn't wear

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.929 
more smooth but it also doesn't wear
like<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.140> would<00:00:29.319> a<00:00:29.349> usual<00:00:29.890> leather<00:00:30.099> band<00:00:30.399> so<00:00:30.819> it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
like it would a usual leather band so it

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.950 
like it would a usual leather band so it
actually<00:00:31.179> look<00:00:31.300> at<00:00:31.390> brand-new<00:00:31.749> you<00:00:31.810> can<00:00:31.899> see

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
actually look at brand-new you can see

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually look at brand-new you can see
there's<00:00:32.110> no<00:00:32.200> creasing<00:00:32.649> in<00:00:32.770> here<00:00:32.950> now<00:00:33.310> I<00:00:33.340> need

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
there's no creasing in here now I need

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.100 
there's no creasing in here now I need
any<00:00:33.820> dents<00:00:34.180> or<00:00:34.390> anything<00:00:34.630> like<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.930> you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
any dents or anything like that that you

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.930 
any dents or anything like that that you
would<00:00:35.200> usually<00:00:35.410> see<00:00:35.620> with<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:35.980> leather<00:00:36.219> band<00:00:36.460> so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
would usually see with a leather band so

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.569 
would usually see with a leather band so
it<00:00:37.000> gives<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.390> very<00:00:37.420> good<00:00:37.899> structure<00:00:38.260> as<00:00:38.800> you

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
it gives it a very good structure as you

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.759 
it gives it a very good structure as you
pass<00:00:39.820> over<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.420> back<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:40.960> you<00:00:41.440> can<00:00:41.590> see

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
pass over to the back of it you can see

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.169 
pass over to the back of it you can see
that<00:00:41.920> they<00:00:42.039> use<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.370> same<00:00:42.609> coating<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
that they use that same coating on the

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.270 
that they use that same coating on the
inside<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:44.260> when<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.500> usually<00:00:44.890> have<00:00:45.070> this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
inside so when you usually have this

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400 
inside so when you usually have this
this<00:00:45.820> lighter<00:00:46.059> tan<00:00:46.420> color<00:00:46.690> on<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.960> inside<00:00:47.230> and

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
this lighter tan color on the inside and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.900 
this lighter tan color on the inside and
would<00:00:47.559> soak<00:00:47.829> up<00:00:48.039> sweat<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.579> things<00:00:48.730> like<00:00:48.850> that

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
would soak up sweat and things like that

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.240 
would soak up sweat and things like that
it<00:00:49.480> actually<00:00:49.780> doesn't<00:00:50.140> do<00:00:50.379> that<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:50.589> resists

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
it actually doesn't do that it resists

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.069 
it actually doesn't do that it resists
it<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.399> little<00:00:51.609> bit<00:00:51.730> which<00:00:51.969> makes<00:00:52.719> it<00:00:52.870> last

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
it a little bit which makes it last

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.560 
it a little bit which makes it last
longer<00:00:53.289> doesn't<00:00:53.800> discolor<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:54.789> think<00:00:55.359> they

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
longer doesn't discolor so I think they

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.049 
longer doesn't discolor so I think they
did<00:00:55.719> very<00:00:55.749> very<00:00:56.320> nice<00:00:56.850> finishing<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:57.940> this

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
did very very nice finishing on this

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.790 
did very very nice finishing on this
band<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.510> makes<00:00:58.660> it<00:00:58.780> look<00:00:58.839> very<00:00:59.079> very<00:00:59.289> good

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
band that makes it look very very good

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.439 
band that makes it look very very good
and<00:00:59.890> will<00:01:00.010> last<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.399> long<00:01:00.550> time<00:01:00.579> if<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.210> look<00:01:01.359> at

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
and will last a long time if you look at

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.029 
and will last a long time if you look at
how<00:01:01.539> it<00:01:01.690> attaches<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.409> case<00:01:02.649> here<00:01:02.920> I'll

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
how it attaches to the case here I'll

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.920 
how it attaches to the case here I'll
move<00:01:03.370> up<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.609> little<00:01:03.730> bit<00:01:03.879> closer<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.480> can<00:01:04.809> see

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
move up a little bit closer you can see

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
move up a little bit closer you can see
that<00:01:05.080> they<00:01:05.290> actually<00:01:05.590> don't<00:01:05.740> use<00:01:05.890> straight

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
that they actually don't use straight

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.070 
that they actually don't use straight
through<00:01:06.970> spring<00:01:07.390> bars<00:01:07.600> they<00:01:07.750> actually<00:01:07.960> use

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
through spring bars they actually use

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.590 
through spring bars they actually use
curved<00:01:08.470> spring<00:01:08.860> bars<00:01:09.100> which<00:01:09.730> allows<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.240> gap

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
curved spring bars which allows this gap

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.690 
curved spring bars which allows this gap
right<00:01:10.630> here<00:01:11.230> to<00:01:11.410> be<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.530> lot<00:01:11.710> smaller<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.370> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
right here to be a lot smaller and it

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.430 
right here to be a lot smaller and it
hugs<00:01:12.910> the<00:01:13.240> case<00:01:13.660> a<00:01:13.690> little<00:01:13.870> bit<00:01:14.020> better<00:01:14.230> which

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
hugs the case a little bit better which

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.140 
hugs the case a little bit better which
gives<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.800> nice<00:01:14.950> look<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.460> that's<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.060> nice

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
gives it a nice look and that's a nice

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
gives it a nice look and that's a nice
little<00:01:16.330> finishing<00:01:16.690> touch<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:16.990> they<00:01:17.260> have

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
little finishing touch that they have

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.670 
little finishing touch that they have
just<00:01:18.580> putting<00:01:19.150> it<00:01:19.240> together<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.690> clasp<00:01:20.350> on

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
just putting it together the clasp on

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.070 
just putting it together the clasp on
this<00:01:20.830> piece<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.340> really<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.000> nice<00:01:22.210> work<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.930> art

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
this piece is really a nice work of art

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200 
this piece is really a nice work of art
you<00:01:23.200> can<00:01:23.320> see<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.680> they<00:01:23.800> have<00:01:23.950> all<00:01:24.400> sorts<00:01:25.030> of

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
you can see that they have all sorts of

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.210 
you can see that they have all sorts of
extra<00:01:25.360> detail<00:01:25.690> here<00:01:26.110> it's<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.380> larger<00:01:26.890> clasp

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
extra detail here it's a larger clasp

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
extra detail here it's a larger clasp
got<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.120> lot<00:01:28.300> more<00:01:28.330> going<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:29.020> far<00:01:29.230> as<00:01:29.410> all

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
got a lot more going on as far as all

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.130 
got a lot more going on as far as all

the different pieces that put it
together<00:01:32.260> even<00:01:32.740> all<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.310> way<00:01:33.370> down<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.880> they

use a screw type blog bar instead on

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650 
use a screw type blog bar instead on
this<00:01:35.920> one<00:01:36.100> get<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> little<00:01:36.880> bit<00:01:37.000> extra<00:01:37.180> security

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
this one get a little bit extra security

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.590 
this one get a little bit extra security
where<00:01:38.170> they<00:01:38.260> usually<00:01:38.590> put<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> pin<00:01:39.600> regular

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
style buckle they actually use that

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.920 
style buckle they actually use that
space<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:45.030> attachment<00:01:46.030> here<00:01:46.270> sits

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
space so that this attachment here sits

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.680 
space so that this attachment here sits
in<00:01:47.080> here<00:01:47.260> nice<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.470> flush<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.580> sturdy<00:01:49.330> so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
in here nice and flush and sturdy so

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.010 
in here nice and flush and sturdy so
overall<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:50.980> this<00:01:51.370> piece<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.660> back<00:01:52.840> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
overall this this piece on the back the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.200 
overall this this piece on the back the
deployment<00:01:53.530> clasp<00:01:53.710> really<00:01:54.610> matches<00:01:55.060> all<00:01:55.180> of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
deployment clasp really matches all of

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.360 
deployment clasp really matches all of
the<00:01:55.420> metal<00:01:55.690> work<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:55.870> they<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.230> on<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:57.100> case

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
the metal work that they do on the case

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.430 
the metal work that they do on the case
so<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.700> looks<00:01:57.850> very<00:01:58.030> nice<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.110> think<00:01:59.350> they

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
so it looks very nice and I think they

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.630 
so it looks very nice and I think they
did<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> great<00:01:59.710> job<00:01:59.830> on<00:02:00.070> that's<00:02:00.370> one<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
did a great job on that's one of the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.320 
did a great job on that's one of the
nicest<00:02:00.970> clefts<00:02:01.300> we've<00:02:02.200> ever<00:02:02.350> seen<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:03.330> talking

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
nicest clefts we've ever seen so talking

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.290 
nicest clefts we've ever seen so talking
about<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.600> case<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> functions<00:02:06.850> on<00:02:07.000> here

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
about the case and the functions on here

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.690 
about the case and the functions on here
let's<00:02:07.480> start<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> 24<00:02:08.289> hour<00:02:08.700> internal

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
let's start with a 24 hour internal

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.070 
let's start with a 24 hour internal
bezel<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.119> we<00:02:10.209> wanted<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.479> talk<00:02:10.690> about<00:02:10.840> this

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
bezel and we wanted to talk about this

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.750 
bezel and we wanted to talk about this
because<00:02:11.290> something<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:12.430> were<00:02:12.490> concerned

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
because something that we were concerned

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
because something that we were concerned
about<00:02:12.880> was<00:02:13.060> would<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.780> move<00:02:14.020> while<00:02:14.320> you're

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
about was would it move while you're

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.900 
about was would it move while you're
wearing<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> answer<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.370> yes<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.760> does

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
wearing it and the answer is yes it does

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.470 
wearing it and the answer is yes it does
move<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.180> little

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
move a little

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.899 
move a little
it<00:02:16.690> doesn't<00:02:17.319> move<00:02:17.440> much<00:02:18.069> when<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.489> was<00:02:18.700> wearing

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
it doesn't move much when I was wearing

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.180 
it doesn't move much when I was wearing
it<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.209> only<00:02:19.300> moved<00:02:19.629> less<00:02:20.409> than<00:02:20.650> an<00:02:20.739> hour<00:02:20.890> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it it only moved less than an hour so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.490 
it it only moved less than an hour so
we'll<00:02:21.310> move<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.690> much<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.260> said

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
we'll move about that much and that said

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
we'll move about that much and that said
so<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> huge<00:02:24.940> deal<00:02:24.970> they<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:25.959> have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
so not really a huge deal they do have

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.539 
so not really a huge deal they do have
another<00:02:26.409> style<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:27.040> they<00:02:27.129> call<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> roto

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
another style that they call a roto

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.830 
another style that they call a roto
clique<00:02:27.879> which<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.540> their<00:02:28.690> other

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
clique which you can get on their other

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.449 
clique which you can get on their other
watches<00:02:29.319> but<00:02:29.769> if<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:29.950> isn't<00:02:30.159> something

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
watches but if this isn't something

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.410 
watches but if this isn't something
that's<00:02:30.549> going<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.819> be<00:02:30.970> very<00:02:31.120> mission<00:02:31.299> critical

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that's going to be very mission critical

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630 
that's going to be very mission critical
for<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> big<00:02:32.709> deal<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.129> that<00:02:33.250> didn't

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
for you not a big deal and that didn't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.890 
for you not a big deal and that didn't
move<00:02:33.730> nearly<00:02:34.060> as<00:02:34.150> far<00:02:34.299> as<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.510> thought<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.810> would

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
move nearly as far as I thought it would

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900 
move nearly as far as I thought it would
because<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.319> is<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.920> does<00:02:36.129> move<00:02:36.370> very<00:02:36.670> easily

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
because it is it does move very easily

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.270 
because it is it does move very easily
but<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:38.260> really<00:02:38.379> doesn't<00:02:38.590> catch<00:02:38.860> your<00:02:39.010> hand<00:02:39.099> as

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
but it really doesn't catch your hand as

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.050 
but it really doesn't catch your hand as
much<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.549> we<00:02:39.640> thought

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
much as we thought

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.960 
much as we thought
also<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.470> style<00:02:41.769> has<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> lot<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.579> on<00:02:42.700> you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
also this style has a lot going on you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.580 
also this style has a lot going on you
can<00:02:43.480> see<00:02:43.510> there's<00:02:43.810> all<00:02:43.930> sorts<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.260> different

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
can see there's all sorts of different

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.619 
can see there's all sorts of different
functions<00:02:45.040> we<00:02:45.190> talked<00:02:45.370> about<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:45.909> GMT<00:02:46.390> hand

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
functions we talked about as a GMT hand

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.569 
functions we talked about as a GMT hand
as<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.140> regular<00:02:47.500> chronograph<00:02:47.980> has<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> date

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
as a regular chronograph has a date

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.850 
as a regular chronograph has a date
feature<00:02:48.849> what<00:02:49.569> they<00:02:49.720> did<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.260> break<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.680> up

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
feature what they did to break that up

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.259 
feature what they did to break that up
and<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.160> looks<00:02:51.370> really<00:02:51.640> good<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.030> they<00:02:52.150> use

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and what looks really good is they use

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.000 
and what looks really good is they use
different<00:02:52.480> colors<00:02:53.049> here<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
different colors here so you have the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.800 
different colors here so you have the
grey<00:02:54.220> throughout<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
grey throughout the back you have the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.720 
grey throughout the back you have the
different<00:02:56.170> textures<00:02:56.709> between<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.190> 24-hour

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
different textures between the 24-hour

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.970 
different textures between the 24-hour
and<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.450> minutes<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.019> then<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.590> see<00:02:59.859> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
and the minutes and then you can see the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.309 
and the minutes and then you can see the
very<00:03:00.129> red<00:03:00.430> dials<00:03:00.879> for<00:03:01.629> all<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> different

very red dials for all of the different

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.550 
very red dials for all of the different
timing<00:03:02.650> functions<00:03:03.120> which<00:03:04.120> which<00:03:04.629> is<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.140> nice

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
timing functions which which is is nice

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050 
timing functions which which is is nice
because<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:06.129> breaks<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.549> up<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.940> it's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
because it breaks it up so that it's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.300 
because it breaks it up so that it's
easier<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> read<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.530> you're<00:03:08.650> quickly<00:03:09.010> looking

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
easier to read if you're quickly looking

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.680 
easier to read if you're quickly looking
at<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.609> so<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.760> they<00:03:10.060> did<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> very<00:03:10.329> good<00:03:10.540> job

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
at it so that they did a very good job

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.170 
at it so that they did a very good job
with<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:12.160> chrono<00:03:12.459> pushers<00:03:12.849> on<00:03:13.030> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
with that the chrono pushers on this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.559 
with that the chrono pushers on this
piece<00:03:13.390> very<00:03:13.660> easy<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:15.519> initiate<00:03:15.819> but<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> little

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
piece very easy to initiate but a little

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.930 
piece very easy to initiate but a little
hard<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.140> push<00:03:17.440> which<00:03:17.829> is<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> good<00:03:18.280> thing<00:03:18.519> so

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
hard to push which is a good thing so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.490 
hard to push which is a good thing so
that<00:03:19.090> way<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.329> doesn't<00:03:19.510> accidentally<00:03:20.200> touch

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
that way it doesn't accidentally touch

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.409 
that way it doesn't accidentally touch
too<00:03:20.799> easily<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.609> can<00:03:21.730> see<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.060> they're<00:03:22.239> very

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
too easily you can see that they're very

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.949 
too easily you can see that they're very
quiet<00:03:23.010> every<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.069> very<00:03:24.220> good<00:03:24.340> feel<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.609> them<00:03:24.970> so

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
quiet every a very good feel to them so

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.390 
quiet every a very good feel to them so
I<00:03:26.019> think<00:03:26.079> it's<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.560> good<00:03:26.739> balance<00:03:26.919> that<00:03:27.280> they

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
I think it's a good balance that they

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.280 
I think it's a good balance that they
made<00:03:27.579> with<00:03:27.760> these<00:03:27.910> two<00:03:28.120> chrono<00:03:28.780> pushers<00:03:29.139> it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
made with these two chrono pushers it

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.650 
made with these two chrono pushers it
really<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.489> feel<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.150> has<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.480> same

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
really the feel of this has the same

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.020 
really the feel of this has the same
feel<00:03:31.900> throughout<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> watch<00:03:32.440> free

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
feel throughout the watch free

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.509 
feel throughout the watch free
mechanised<00:03:34.030> clean<00:03:34.480> feel<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.370> talking<00:03:36.370> a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
mechanised clean feel to it talking a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.949 
mechanised clean feel to it talking a
little<00:03:36.609> bit<00:03:36.730> more<00:03:36.819> about<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> metal<00:03:37.389> work<00:03:37.540> we

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
little bit more about the metal work we

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.390 
little bit more about the metal work we
touched<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.380> last<00:03:38.680> time<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.919> wanted<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.190> show

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
