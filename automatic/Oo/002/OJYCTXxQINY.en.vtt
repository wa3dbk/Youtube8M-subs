00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
body from the a plate and the reason it

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.550 
body from the a plate and the reason it
zoomed<00:04:45.880> out<00:04:46.000> here<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.509> just<00:04:46.750> yes<00:04:47.020> there's<00:04:47.380> the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
zoomed out here is just yes there's the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.770 
zoomed out here is just yes there's the
V<00:04:47.710> plate<00:04:47.979> from<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.220> h1<00:04:48.610> normal<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.479> quite<00:04:49.750> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
V plate from the h1 normal so quite a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.300 
V plate from the h1 normal so quite a
bit<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.050> difference<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.560> terms<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:51.070> primary

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
bit of difference in terms of primary

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.629 
bit of difference in terms of primary
colors<00:04:51.729> here<00:04:52.180> but<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:53.680> top<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.009> h1<00:04:54.310> normal

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
colors here but to top the h1 normal

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.830 
colors here but to top the h1 normal
you're<00:04:54.759> going<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:54.940> be<00:04:55.000> getting<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.270> whole<00:04:55.479> plate

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
you're going to be getting a whole plate

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.110 
you're going to be getting a whole plate
of<00:04:55.870> effect<00:04:56.289> parts<00:04:56.560> here<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.250> G<00:04:57.430> plate<00:04:57.699> and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
of effect parts here on the G plate and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.790 
of effect parts here on the G plate and
I<00:04:58.479> remember<00:04:58.810> when<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.050> came<00:04:59.260> out<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.440> thought

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
I remember when this came out I thought

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.200 
I remember when this came out I thought
I<00:04:59.949> saw<00:05:00.130> those<00:05:00.310> parts<00:05:00.639> on<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.820> wrist<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.150> I

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
I saw those parts on the wrist and I

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.270 
I saw those parts on the wrist and I
thought<00:05:01.389> oh<00:05:01.419> maybe<00:05:01.720> you'll<00:05:01.930> get<00:05:02.080> one<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.680> I

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
thought oh maybe you'll get one and I

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.860 
thought oh maybe you'll get one and I
wasn't<00:05:03.490> even<00:05:03.639> aware<00:05:03.940> of<00:05:04.120> these<00:05:04.210> until<00:05:04.660> today

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
wasn't even aware of these until today

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.600 
wasn't even aware of these until today
and<00:05:05.139> it's<00:05:05.620> just<00:05:05.860> amazing<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.400> fact<00:05:06.520> that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
and it's just amazing the fact that

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.710 
and it's just amazing the fact that
they're<00:05:06.789> gonna<00:05:06.850> give<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.240> everything<00:05:07.539> you

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
they're gonna give you everything you

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.110 
they're gonna give you everything you
need<00:05:07.870> for<00:05:08.050> two<00:05:08.229> lariats<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.880> seven<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.970> these

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
need for two lariats and seven of these

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.879 
need for two lariats and seven of these
so<00:05:10.300> we<00:05:10.389> could<00:05:10.539> do<00:05:10.630> two<00:05:10.870> shoulder<00:05:11.260> tackles<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
so we could do two shoulder tackles and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.740 
so we could do two shoulder tackles and
two<00:05:11.979> knee<00:05:12.310> kicks<00:05:12.610> all<00:05:13.090> at<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.539> same<00:05:13.690> time

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
two knee kicks all at the same time

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.330 
two knee kicks all at the same time
which<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.289> going<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:14.650> be<00:05:14.740> pretty<00:05:14.949> ridiculous

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
which is going to be pretty ridiculous

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.250 
which is going to be pretty ridiculous
but<00:05:15.669> still<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.479> much<00:05:16.690> better<00:05:16.840> because<00:05:17.139> you

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
but still it's much better because you

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.870 
but still it's much better because you
could<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.590> just<00:05:17.800> conceivably<00:05:18.370> had<00:05:18.580> one<00:05:18.789> of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
could have just conceivably had one of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.060 
could have just conceivably had one of
these<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.330> four<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.080> those<00:05:20.199> but<00:05:20.470> banned<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.830> did

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
these and four of those but banned I did

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.710 
these and four of those but banned I did
not<00:05:21.280> chance<00:05:21.669> at<00:05:22.060> all

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
not chance at all

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.839 
not chance at all
the<00:05:23.199> seals<00:05:23.470> are<00:05:23.650> exactly<00:05:24.190> as<00:05:24.310> you'd<00:05:24.460> expect

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
the seals are exactly as you'd expect

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.909 
the seals are exactly as you'd expect
for<00:05:25.030> any<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.479> gundam<00:05:25.810> age-1<00:05:25.930> variations

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
for any of the gundam age-1 variations

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.070 
for any of the gundam age-1 variations
and<00:05:27.490> yes<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.060> advanced<00:05:28.360> grade<00:05:28.750> could<00:05:28.990> have

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
and yes the advanced grade could have

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.070 
and yes the advanced grade could have
used<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.650> couple<00:05:30.039> of<00:05:30.160> these<00:05:30.810> standard<00:05:31.810> manual

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
used a couple of these standard manual

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.689 
used a couple of these standard manual
with<00:05:32.320> again<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:32.710> great<00:05:32.919> looking<00:05:33.220> cover<00:05:33.460> art

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
with again that great looking cover art

with again that great looking cover art
side<00:05:33.940> they've<00:05:34.150> done<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.389> pretty<00:05:34.449> good<00:05:34.810> job<00:05:35.020> of

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
making somebody bulky you look pretty

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.060 
making somebody bulky you look pretty
dynamic<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.780> hopefully<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.530> model<00:05:38.770> can<00:05:38.919> pull

looks<00:07:19.060> like<00:07:19.350> so<00:07:20.350> that<00:07:20.500> was<00:07:20.590> a<00:07:20.620> fun<00:07:20.800> unbox<00:07:21.190> for

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
looks like so that was a fun unbox for

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.100 
looks like so that was a fun unbox for
me<00:07:21.460> especially<00:07:21.640> since<00:07:22.000> I<00:07:22.390> was<00:07:22.570> just<00:07:22.780> surprised

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
me especially since I was just surprised

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.600 
me especially since I was just surprised
to<00:07:23.230> see<00:07:23.320> how<00:07:23.770> many<00:07:23.830> different<00:07:24.160> things<00:07:24.400> are

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
to see how many different things are

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.730 
to see how many different things are
gonna<00:07:24.730> get<00:07:24.940> just<00:07:25.630> because<00:07:25.720> I<00:07:25.900> haven't<00:07:26.410> been<00:07:26.560> as

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
gonna get just because I haven't been as

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.350 
gonna get just because I haven't been as
watching<00:07:27.100> as<00:07:27.190> many<00:07:27.340> previews<00:07:27.760> as<00:07:27.880> I<00:07:27.910> could

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
watching as many previews as I could

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.910 
watching as many previews as I could
it's<00:07:28.810> good<00:07:28.990> to<00:07:29.110> see<00:07:29.230> that<00:07:29.380> they've<00:07:29.530> got<00:07:29.710> all

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:29.920 
it's good to see that they've got all

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.560 
it's good to see that they've got all
sorts<00:07:30.280> of<00:07:30.340> new<00:07:30.490> plates<00:07:30.760> in<00:07:30.970> here<00:07:31.150> so<00:07:31.360> people

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.570 
sorts of new plates in here so people

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.210 
sorts of new plates in here so people
that<00:07:31.780> were<00:07:31.870> thinking<00:07:32.230> that<00:07:32.260> the<00:07:32.530> h1<00:07:32.920> would<00:07:33.100> get

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
that were thinking that the h1 would get

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.860 
that were thinking that the h1 would get
repetitive<00:07:33.520> well<00:07:34.270> you've<00:07:34.390> only<00:07:34.510> got<00:07:34.690> two

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
repetitive well you've only got two

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.150 
repetitive well you've only got two
thirds<00:07:35.110> of<00:07:35.230> an<00:07:35.350> a<00:07:35.440> plate<00:07:35.650> that's<00:07:35.860> going<00:07:35.980> to<00:07:36.040> be

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 
thirds of an a plate that's going to be

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.280 
thirds of an a plate that's going to be
dull<00:07:36.340> and<00:07:36.610> the<00:07:36.700> rest<00:07:36.940> should<00:07:37.630> be<00:07:37.690> new<00:07:37.990> and

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
dull and the rest should be new and

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.080 
dull and the rest should be new and
fairly<00:07:38.650> interesting<00:07:38.950> the<00:07:39.670> fact<00:07:39.880> that<00:07:40.030> they

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
fairly interesting the fact that they

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.570 
fairly interesting the fact that they
gave<00:07:40.210> you<00:07:40.420> 14<00:07:40.870> parts<00:07:41.230> to<00:07:41.440> lariats<00:07:41.890> and<00:07:42.070> the

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
gave you 14 parts to lariats and the

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.430 
gave you 14 parts to lariats and the
fact<00:07:42.790> that<00:07:42.850> you've<00:07:43.060> got<00:07:43.240> no<00:07:43.540> seals<00:07:43.930> throughout

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 
fact that you've got no seals throughout

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.470 
fact that you've got no seals throughout
this<00:07:44.590> kit<00:07:44.860> except<00:07:45.730> on<00:07:45.850> the<00:07:45.940> head<00:07:46.060> in<00:07:46.150> the<00:07:46.240> chest

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:46.480 
this kit except on the head in the chest

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.460 
this kit except on the head in the chest
and<00:07:46.630> that<00:07:46.720> it's<00:07:46.900> looking<00:07:47.230> this<00:07:47.410> good

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:47.470 
and that it's looking this good

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.950 
and that it's looking this good
hopefully<00:07:48.340> it's<00:07:48.910> the<00:07:49.300> difference<00:07:49.780> between

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 
hopefully it's the difference between

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.960 
hopefully it's the difference between
what<00:07:50.320> you<00:07:50.350> see<00:07:50.680> here<00:07:51.010> from<00:07:51.190> what<00:07:51.460> the<00:07:51.550> pros<00:07:51.760> do

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970 
what you see here from what the pros do

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.760 
what you see here from what the pros do
and<00:07:52.210> what<00:07:52.690> I<00:07:52.720> can<00:07:52.960> put<00:07:53.080> together<00:07:53.169> just<00:07:53.410> being

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.770 
and what I can put together just being

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.050 
and what I can put together just being
lazy<00:07:53.919> and<00:07:54.220> just<00:07:54.310> stamping<00:07:54.669> it<00:07:54.790> all<00:07:54.880> together

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
lazy and just stamping it all together

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.050 
lazy and just stamping it all together
is<00:07:55.390> going<00:07:56.140> to<00:07:56.260> be<00:07:56.530> negligible<00:07:57.100> anyway

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.060 
is going to be negligible anyway

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.120 
is going to be negligible anyway
