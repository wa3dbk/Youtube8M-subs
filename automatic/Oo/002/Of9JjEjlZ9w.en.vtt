 jersey suitcase forgotten and suddenly 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 they always stood there without equipment 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 it came to the unfamiliar picture 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 point game in the sports hall east he the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.180

 Home jerseys on the guests' chest 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.629

 thanked the responsible of fortis 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 and promised himself for the return match 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.940
 to come up with something very special 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.539
 to let 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.059
 at the beginning of the game the 2156 have 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 spectators the feeling that ehinger would have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 in addition to the jerseys also the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 intensity forgotten at home because 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 pour came with a lot of energy from the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 Cabin and had light at the start 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.340
 game 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.530
 so it was said after three minutes already 19 0 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 especially for the hosts 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 british national player miles hessen 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.820
 it was once more the game already 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 early imprinted his stamp 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 came slowly into the game but with 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 the duration of the work was increasing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.619
 boys from the danube rhine shortly before 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.670
 quarter was the gieÃŸener projection 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.049
 melted at three points 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 but the middle hess of it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 Unimpressed, you continued to move 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 fast-paced offensive game by captain 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.950
 Josue with a nice performance 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 with 23 points should be good to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.110
 topscorer of the game 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 It was always hessen the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.320
 Briton secures the rebound here 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.750
 from the basket and scores with foul 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.720
 The first quarter was completely earned 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.270
 with 24 to 13 to the team of coach 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.800
 denis usurer 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 it was also the second passage 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.940
 team in white who set the tone 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.040
 pour out a dedicated 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.200
 Defense also had clear 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.550
 advantages in the rebounds and could 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.110
 always nice 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.130
 leave individual actions 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.810
 Steven Bernard goes to the basket 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.670
 the only drawback in the giessen game 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 they showed up that evening 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.140
 little too hospitable it missed 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.630
 to settle more clearly 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.760
 So it was constant until the break 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.250
 with only ten counters in the back 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.820
 nice pass on taylor rohde and the im 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.709
 it was 44 at half-time 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.709
 34 from the giessener point of view 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.010
 after the page change the game now 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.050
 balanced 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.209
 beautiful ballstaffette the ehinger the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.820
 ball lands at virgil matthews and the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.400
 Fueled by the pourers left in 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.650
 this phase the intensity in attack 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.660
 and defense logically 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.519
 denis usurer requested a time-out 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.860
 but the ford the sixers seemed 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.959
 somehow lost the thread 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.860
 ehingen now found more and more access 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.080
 on the lot 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.519
 Lischka from the left side only hits 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.470
 The ring ehingen secures the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.480
 rebounds and starts to fastbreak in 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:17.170
 the other direction at the end of the chain 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.660
 is only then taylor or it came like it 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.310
 They had to come to the end of the day 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.739
 third quarter suddenly in the lead 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.959
 but the residue before the final 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.180
 Passage was only from the giessener point of view 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.730
 Two points now had the young 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.180
 troupe of fortis sixers a reaction 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.220
 show and the came also brought deep 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.290
 now the press defense out after 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.230
 two quick ball wins lit up 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.670
 suddenly a 60 to 58 lead again 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.980
 from the scoreboard 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.650
 the Middle Hessians were now berating themselves 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.380
 Impeller Saibou on anja they the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.260
 free job and the 28 big us 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.450
 americans do that very cleverly 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.459
 In the end it was reserved for the captain 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.130
 his team on the winner road to 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.910
 lead after this threes of st 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.220
 the decided with 82 to 75 celebrate the 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.200
 fod sixers pour the fourth victory in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:14.800
 Follow and stand in the table 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.630
 we have fifth place in the third quarter 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.370
 a little bit worn off but we have the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.470
 Whole week worked for today 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.330
 to clinch the fourth victory in a row 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.100
 therefore, the harder the last 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.750
 could have gone quarter and so the victory 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.970
 secure as in recent games 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.090
 We have always struggled again 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.050
 and everything and we always succeed 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.490
 again to leave it again and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.800
 it is usually up to the opponent 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.140
 but our little constant our line 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.600
 pull through and that's why we work 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:52.240
 and I think that will happen in the course of 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:57.240
 season in any case the basketball
