00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.170
 yes we also 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.789
 with youtube friends as they are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.460
 welcome to a new news video 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 of minecraft pocket edition version 0.10 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.009
 zero point yes gentlemen there are still no things 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.929
 beyond the 0.9 point zero and 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.060
 it will probably take less time to take out 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.040
 this version compared with the time in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 take out the most recent version but good 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 we'll see that with the passing of days 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
 Meanwhile there are several things that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.560
 Minecraft developers and have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
 announced through twitter the 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.780
 which are tomás or chechi and johann berg 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.910
 heart are and in this case there are four 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.830
 things that are the most prominent because 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 there are even other improvements in terms of 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.820
 performance of the shows and other things 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.740
 more but what really stands out are the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.329
 next news 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.489
 the first thing that we are guys and this 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.500
 It could be disappointing but good 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 according to gioja links 15 the minecraft 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 would come in the next version that is 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 0.10 zero point however 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 announced that this will no longer be possible 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 because there are more things that have 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 priority that the skins here is the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.660
 tuit the corners will not be added in 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.910
 the next version a few things 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.190
 they arrived that have to be proven from 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.630
 all ways we will continue working and 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.729
 good guys like they just heard it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 and if they know English as they have just read it 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.830
 the corners of minecraft may not be 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.500
 added until version 0.1 or 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.420
 even at 1.0 point 0 but good 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 guys already happening with our news 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
 tommaso has been implementing a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 Shaders style is to say shadows of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 fire shadows a little more advanced like 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 those that currently have but not so the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.130
 aesthetics like those of the shaders mod of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.490
 pc re good anyway it turns out 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.820
 attractive the effect of shaders and this what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.250
 we know with these two tweets 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.500
 if the cep and now render the terrain 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.560
 with shadows is the future it feels to be 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.120
 finally in 2004 and in this tweet 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.420
 they only mention the shadows but in the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.399
 next tuit gives us an example rule 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.530
 one of writing shadows you must place 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.060
 the shadows in the water the works look 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 great and even a little less 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 IANAS minecraft and as we can see 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.570
 boys in the picture actually look 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.130
 very cool in the waves of minecraft and 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.110
 there are probably other 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.450
 implementations in addition to the waves in 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.610
 the water but good guys already going with 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.800
 the third news is that johan has 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.200
 implemented new textures for 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600
 fences but better said new types of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.820
 fences because there are different 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.100
 wood types and therefore different 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.410
 colors the fences will correspond to 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
 color of the wood where they are processed is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.880
 say if there is acacia wood and 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.890
 fences you make with this wood are going to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.980
 be of that same color the color of the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.950
 Cassie here is the tweet plus types of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.260
 fences at 0.10 point zero and good 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.239
 guys just here is the image and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.030
 first we only see the new ones 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.120
 tonalities of fences at 0.10 point 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.069
 zero 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.409
 and thanks guys the latest news is 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.870
 very great in my opinion it turns out that 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.640
 tommaso added one more feature to the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.129
 table biome and are the mines 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.930
 abandoned but on the surface here 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.629
 there are the tweets 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.480
 the cep and now with 100% more fever 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.340
 gold basically the mines can now 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.700
 appear on the surfaces of the table 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.040
 only by stereotypes and those guys 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.569
 now the abandoned mines can be 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 on top of the table's biomes 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.769
 only because in the old east there was 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.189
 mines where gold was mined and by 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.840
 course there were some external mines 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.609
 but good guys so far those 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.650
 are all the news about the new 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.389
 version of minecraft pocket edition that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 Well the truth right now does not cause 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.989
 too much expectation but good 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810
 really does not have much that came out the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.000
 Steel point 9.5 came missing a long time 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.489
 of development of mike al pis 0.10 point 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.139
 zero so guys do not despair of 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.090
 done we're still fine with the version 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.709
 current but good anyway to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.139
 we all like the new things of 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.969
 minecraft and now yes guys I say goodbye 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.370

 I upload videos often basically 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.819
 because at school they have left me 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.469
 tasks that are tedious as they consume 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.540
 too long and do not let me burn 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.340
 taste so guys be attentive 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.680
