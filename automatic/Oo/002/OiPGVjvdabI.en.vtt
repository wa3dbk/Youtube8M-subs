00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
channel by the single fastest card you

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.740 
channel by the single fastest card you
can<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.889> then<00:00:13.920> SLI<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> need<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.480> and

to<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.470> honest<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> 770<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:17.730> probably<00:00:18.119> in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
to be honest the 770 was probably in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480 
to be honest the 770 was probably in
ease<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.230> single<00:00:19.529> fastest<00:00:19.830> card<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.250> need

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
ease the single fastest card I need

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.599 
ease the single fastest card I need
personally<00:00:21.109> but<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.890> curious<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.340> wanted

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
personally but I I was curious I wanted

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.060 
personally but I I was curious I wanted
to<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.630> videos<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.710> maxed

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
to get my my videos pretty much maxed

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.400 
to get my my videos pretty much maxed
out<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.550> battlefield<00:00:27.269> 4<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.750> ultra<00:00:28.199> settings

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
out in battlefield 4 like ultra settings

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.589 
out in battlefield 4 like ultra settings
and<00:00:28.859> still<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.609> able<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> hit<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.090> 100<00:00:30.420> frames

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and still be able to hit like 100 frames

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
and still be able to hit like 100 frames
per<00:00:30.840> second<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.130> able<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
per second and you know be able to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.069 
per second and you know be able to
record<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> same<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.570> pretty

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
record it at the same time that's pretty

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.990 
record it at the same time that's pretty
demanding<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.800> far<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.130> graphics<00:00:35.520> power<00:00:35.670> goes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
demanding as far as graphics power goes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.270 
demanding as far as graphics power goes
so<00:00:36.270> figured<00:00:37.020> second<00:00:37.380> 70<00:00:37.680> should<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.010> us<00:00:38.129> there

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
so figured second 70 should get us there

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
so figured second 70 should get us there
we<00:00:38.460> should<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:38.969> solid<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.110> did<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> do

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
we should be pretty solid now did it do

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.979 
we should be pretty solid now did it do
it<00:00:41.190> absolutely<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.329> playing<00:00:42.570> battlefield

it absolutely i was playing battlefield
100<00:00:43.350> frames<00:00:43.469> per<00:00:43.649> second<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.100> able<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
100 frames per second i was able to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.619 
100 frames per second i was able to
record<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.820> everything<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

probably like a week ago I sitting here
and<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> hot<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:52.949> room<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I bring in my thermostat or my

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
I bring in my thermostat or my
thermometer<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.120> set<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.690> desk

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
thermometer and I set it down on my desk

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
thermometer and I set it down on my desk
and<00:00:58.350> after<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> few<00:00:59.160> minutes<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.579> starts

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and after a few minutes it starts

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.380 
and after a few minutes it starts
reading<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.270> 80<00:01:00.680> 85<00:01:01.680> degrees<00:01:02.280> 90<00:01:03.090> degrees

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
reading like 80 85 degrees 90 degrees

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
reading like 80 85 degrees 90 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> live<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> hot

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Fahrenheit and you know I live in a hot

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.010 
Fahrenheit and you know I live in a hot
environment<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.820> admit<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.330> normally

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
environment I will admit but normally

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.289 
environment I will admit but normally
the<00:01:07.110> house<00:01:07.229> stays<00:01:07.470> around<00:01:07.680> 75<00:01:08.310> 78<00:01:09.060> degrees

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the house stays around 75 78 degrees

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
the house stays around 75 78 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:09.900> 80<00:01:10.710> degrees<00:01:11.070> Fahrenheit<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.460> think

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
Fahrenheit 80 degrees Fahrenheit i think

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.580 
Fahrenheit 80 degrees Fahrenheit i think
is<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.030> 31<00:01:12.450> degrees<00:01:12.600> celsius<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> guys

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is like 31 degrees celsius for you guys

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.690 
is like 31 degrees celsius for you guys
that<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.010> fahrenheit<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that don't use fahrenheit there's a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
that don't use fahrenheit there's a
ballpark<00:01:15.060> figure<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
ballpark figure for you but that I was

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.570 
ballpark figure for you but that I was
just<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> ridiculous<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.130> hold

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just like that is ridiculous and I hold

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.789 
just like that is ridiculous and I hold
up<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:20.970> precision<00:01:21.570> ex<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> my<00:01:22.049> top<00:01:22.560> card

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
up you know precision ex and my top card

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.560 
up you know precision ex and my top card
is<00:01:22.890> hitting<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> thermal<00:01:23.549> limit<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.210> 79

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is hitting the thermal limit of like 79

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
is hitting the thermal limit of like 79
degrees<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.710> second<00:01:26.040> card<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> hit

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
degrees the second card is about to hit

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
degrees the second card is about to hit
that<00:01:27.030> thermal<00:01:27.450> limit<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.229> I'm

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that thermal limit I'm just like I'm

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
that thermal limit I'm just like I'm
burning<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.579> room<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.210> computer's

about SLI pros and cons and maybe what

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
about SLI pros and cons and maybe what
you<00:02:01.619> guys<00:02:01.740> should<00:02:01.799> consider<00:02:02.369> before<00:02:02.430> thinking

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you guys should consider before thinking

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.209 
you guys should consider before thinking
about<00:02:03.479> SLI<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.710> said<00:02:04.770> before<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
about SLI and like I said before I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.590 
about SLI and like I said before I
always<00:02:05.430> preach<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> single<00:02:06.329> fastest

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
always preach to get the single fastest

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.059 
always preach to get the single fastest
card<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> Nestle<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> need

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
card you can in the Nestle I if you need

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.300 
card you can in the Nestle I if you need
it<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.069> need

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it but I was like this is what I need

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.190 
it but I was like this is what I need
right<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.910> seven<00:02:12.270> 70s<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.690> need<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> step

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
right here that seven 70s I need to step

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
right here that seven 70s I need to step
it<00:02:13.319> up<00:02:13.410> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it up this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
it up this
780<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.520> SLI<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:15.390> that'll<00:02:15.600> be

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
780 and then SLI that I think that'll be

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.750 
780 and then SLI that I think that'll be
kind<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.710> waste<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.040> money<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.310> shuffling

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
kind of a waste of money and shuffling

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.880 
kind of a waste of money and shuffling
around<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.120> bunch<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.390> components<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.710> gets

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
around a bunch of components it gets

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.730 
around a bunch of components it gets
kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> old<00:02:20.460> after<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.360> while<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.140> figured

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
kind of old after a while so I figured

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.950 
kind of old after a while so I figured
I'll<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.130> with<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> 27<00:02:23.730> 70s<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.570> able<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
I'll get with the 27 70s I was able to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.510 
I'll get with the 27 70s I was able to
play<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.260> games<00:02:25.500> maxed<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.310> really

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
play my games maxed out it was really

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640 
play my games maxed out it was really
nice<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.000> again<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.900> mentioned<00:02:27.930> another

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
nice but again like I mentioned another

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.840 
nice but again like I mentioned another
video<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> while<00:02:29.160> back<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
video a while back it's kind of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.880 
video a while back it's kind of
frustrating<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.960> pull<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.530> game<00:02:31.710> that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
frustrating when you pull up a game that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430 
frustrating when you pull up a game that
isn't<00:02:32.220> optimized<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:32.910> SLI<00:02:33.290> something<00:02:34.290> like

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
isn't optimized for SLI something like

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.700 
isn't optimized for SLI something like
Daisy<00:02:34.950> which<00:02:35.190> could<00:02:35.430> really<00:02:35.850> use<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.150> power

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
Daisy which could really use the power

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.160 
Daisy which could really use the power
and<00:02:37.710> you're<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.820> able<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.360> touch<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.810> second

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and you're not able to touch that second

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.830 
and you're not able to touch that second
card<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:40.920> at<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.540> kind

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
card really at all so it was it was kind

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.350 
card really at all so it was it was kind
of<00:02:42.900> annoying<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.800> see<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.730> power<00:02:45.000> not

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
of annoying to see that that power not

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360 
of annoying to see that that power not
go<00:02:45.570> used<00:02:45.920> compared<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> something<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.250> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
go used compared to something like a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
go used compared to something like a
780ti<00:02:47.910> which<00:02:48.390> would<00:02:48.540> always<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:48.930> working<00:02:48.960> for

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
780ti which would always be working for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.860 
780ti which would always be working for
me<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.830> get<00:02:50.730> me<00:02:50.760> close<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.330> same<00:02:51.450> perform

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
me and get me close to the same perform

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.380 
me and get me close to the same perform
that's<00:02:52.050> not<00:02:52.170> quite<00:02:52.380> what<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.030> seven

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
that's not quite what the what the seven

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.780 
that's not quite what the what the seven
70s<00:02:54.780> are<00:02:54.840> capable<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.860> course<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.700> I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
70s are capable of but of course like I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
70s are capable of but of course like I
said<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.180> game<00:02:57.360> has<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.840> optimized<00:02:58.380> for

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
said the game has to be optimized for

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.880 
said the game has to be optimized for
both<00:02:59.550> seven<00:02:59.850> 70s<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.450> outperform<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:01.260> single

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
both seven 70s to outperform a single

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
both seven 70s to outperform a single
780ti<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:05.070> kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.310> kind<00:03:05.850> of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
780ti so I I just kind of got kind of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.240 
780ti so I I just kind of got kind of
got<00:03:06.030> flustered<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.720> know<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.080> i<00:03:07.500> was<00:03:08.070> playing

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
CS go i've been playing a lot of that

stuff like that to get my hundred frames

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.650 
stuff like that to get my hundred frames
per<00:03:34.530> second<00:03:34.890> rather<00:03:35.130> than<00:03:35.340> dealing<00:03:35.670> with<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
settings and stuttering that I'm getting

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
settings and stuttering that I'm getting
in<00:03:41.550> some<00:03:41.820> games<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.300> was<00:03:42.420> just<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.870> always<00:03:43.350> just

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
in some games it was just I always just

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
really cool um yeah not totally worth it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.360

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
experience with you I mean stuttering is

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.730 
experience with you I mean stuttering is
such<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> hard<00:03:57.240> thing<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.630> predict<00:03:57.990> seems<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
such a hard thing to predict seems a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.250 
such a hard thing to predict seems a
really<00:03:59.040> random<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.670> people<00:03:59.940> so

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
really random for people so

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.210 
really random for people so
unfortunately<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.320> can't<00:04:01.650> sit<00:04:01.830> here<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.070> tell

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
unfortunately I can't sit here and tell

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.800 
unfortunately I can't sit here and tell
you<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.580> your<00:04:02.730> computer<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.660> or

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
you what your computer is going to do or

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.450 
you what your computer is going to do or
how<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.350> perform<00:04:04.710> exactly<00:04:04.980> but

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
how it's going to perform exactly but

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.480 
how it's going to perform exactly but
for<00:04:06.180> my<00:04:06.270> experience<00:04:06.780> if<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.620> do<00:04:07.860> go<00:04:08.070> SLI

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
for my experience if you do go SLI

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.880 
for my experience if you do go SLI
another<00:04:08.760> thing<00:04:08.940> i<00:04:09.000> will<00:04:09.120> mention<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.990> i<00:04:10.200> would

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
another thing i will mention is i would

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.430 
another thing i will mention is i would
recommend<00:04:10.950> getting<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.490> blower<00:04:11.700> style<00:04:12.440> cards

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
recommend getting the blower style cards

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.650 
recommend getting the blower style cards
because<00:04:13.650> those<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.430> tendency<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.940> push

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
because those have a tendency to push

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.510 
because those have a tendency to push
the<00:04:15.810> heat<00:04:15.930> out<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.200> back<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.710> the<00:04:16.890> case<00:04:17.190> rather

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
the heat out the back of the case rather

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.250 
the heat out the back of the case rather
than<00:04:17.670> like<00:04:17.970> my<00:04:18.150> asus<00:04:18.510> cards<00:04:18.840> which<00:04:18.989> kind<00:04:19.200> of

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
than like my asus cards which kind of

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.380 
than like my asus cards which kind of
just<00:04:19.380> blow<00:04:19.950> hot<00:04:20.190> air<00:04:20.220> everywhere<00:04:20.760> inside<00:04:21.210> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
just blow hot air everywhere inside the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.170 
just blow hot air everywhere inside the
case<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.049> was<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:23.160> kind<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.030> almost

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
case so that was really a kind of almost

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820 
case so that was really a kind of almost
concerning<00:04:25.020> how<00:04:25.169> hot<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.590> was

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
concerning how hot it was

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.219 
concerning how hot it was
inside<00:04:26.220> my<00:04:26.370> computer<00:04:26.759> case<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.539> was<00:04:28.080> almost

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
inside my computer case and I was almost

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.809 
inside my computer case and I was almost
having<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:28.680> down<00:04:28.889> clock<00:04:29.250> there<00:04:29.639> for<00:04:29.789> a

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
having a like down clock there for a

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.159 
having a like down clock there for a
little<00:04:29.909> bit<00:04:30.000> i<00:04:30.090> was<00:04:30.210> down<00:04:30.389> clocking<00:04:30.840> my<00:04:30.930> top

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
little bit i was down clocking my top

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.540 
little bit i was down clocking my top
card<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.800> wouldn't<00:04:31.979> hit<00:04:32.069> the<00:04:32.099> thermal

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
card so it wouldn't hit the thermal

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.429 
card so it wouldn't hit the thermal
limit<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:32.939> that<00:04:33.689> was<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.080> yeah<00:04:34.229> this

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:34.439 
limit and that was just like yeah this

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.719 
limit and that was just like yeah this
isn't<00:04:34.590> worth<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:35.189> just<00:04:35.310> going<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.520> sell

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
isn't worth it I'm just going to sell

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.189 
isn't worth it I'm just going to sell
this<00:04:35.849> card<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.419> money<00:04:36.569> in<00:04:36.689> my<00:04:36.780> pocket

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
this card have the money in my pocket

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.670 
this card have the money in my pocket
and<00:04:38.000> maybe<00:04:39.000> when<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> gtx<00:04:39.810> 880<00:04:40.229> comes<00:04:40.500> out

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
and maybe when the gtx 880 comes out

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.600 
and maybe when the gtx 880 comes out
I'll<00:04:40.830> look<00:04:40.919> at<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.280> that's<00:04:41.460> actually

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
I'll look at that that's actually
