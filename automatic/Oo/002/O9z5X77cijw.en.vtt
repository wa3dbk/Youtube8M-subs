00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.660
 about six kilometers to decide 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.820

 tati 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.980
 between what is illegal each state pge 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 Clon the infonet was here. 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 to roll 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 those who today 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300
 indian project 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.360
 and I won because this 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.910
 the ahmadis 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.300
 the House 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 1 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 So 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.690
 many fans 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.620
 and I continued h point 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.460
 Let me tell you here 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.640
 and here I declare 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 the three bodies of people slaughtered 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.670
 he had an outlet 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 bashir we will get the value 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.050
 the law is what shows the rock 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.600
 as a result 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 the worker's chances of these objects 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.590
 but only the item 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.500
 Your father borders what a joyous bond 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 I promised you the species. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.320
 and the actions the idea is called 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.840
 another change in the calculation rule 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 the trombetta voted blank and where does he have to count 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.750
 and I go to work 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.019
 your job 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:11.979
 the other 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.259
 text is a result of more 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.259
 I hope another part 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.659
 of competition as 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 centile leaves under the number one two three 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.069
 this verdict tout vai well zeroed the hearing in process 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.509
 here x change 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.509
 the button designation in the function a button pressed 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.689
 already the button that calculates 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.009
 to know which three of iara says 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.299
 and accordingly 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.929
 air b esse 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:57.919
 the next one since it is more or less the day to feel 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.699
 do try 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.789
 valeri mpla policy areas 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:03.709
 So 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.099
 You do not have to use that signal. 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.109
 or you declare object is injured an essential rule 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.699
 their interest 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.789
 so it will be the same 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:14.669
 Christ 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:15.939
 from Camp 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.569
 with 20 20 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.079
 the three then it is the birdseed 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.810
 that their respective fields and if I loved whole 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:30.119
 is the detail plus three aldermen the delta the x1 in these two 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.129
 ticiane x 2 to 0 results 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.379
 and the delta may opt 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.979
 so here 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.789
 will function normally 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.789
 Someone tells you to accept the trainees. 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.919
 before an exhausted room 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.099
 to ring 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.710
 the pt and psdb treasurer put a 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.409
 this dream 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.069
 x 1 x 2 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.069
 It's hard the concepts I've never seen. 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.449
 I introduce myself 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.300
 and today they are deserving 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.179
 I will work 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.899
 He grabs the text. 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.059
 these facts are not stuffed with any value it would take 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.759
 do not need 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.169
 and will put nothing 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.770
 delete button 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.840
 would you like 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.870
 we ask for its function in its psychological influence 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.879
 Beijing 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.409
 this is what makes you go back then if you have 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.370
 keyboard in any of these fields and click 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 it remains function the rehearsal was to hide 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.029
 I never make you 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.620
 pastor bel conjugates 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.099
 tip follows 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.819
 and I'm going to add 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
 text field 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.039
 leave the bc 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.039
 put agents 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.389
 the idea 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.319
 That is 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.849
 Cool 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.849
 already showing results 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.930
 her pregnancy 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.559
 john cooper also two doctors 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.559
 with the club 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.559
 calculates 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.139
 If you surf this wave 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.139
 expectantly connected 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.189
 Miguel 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.569
 nadal number one coma 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.159
 to 2 with br 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.159
 It's 3 o'clock with the hill. 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.860
 now drink number 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.379
 with law no. 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.550
 how much to pay 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.839
 how to delete 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.279
 was so impressed with calculating 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.619
 how are we going to do now 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:16.379
 that button that stays 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:17.939
 is that the court 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.509
 next month so the button with that suddenly 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:23.969
 pulls 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.969
 lp recover until shiver 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.189
 Cannavaro is really worth it. 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.900
 6 7 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.169
 Key Silver Tip Studies Have 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.439
 only had a debut team if I had an image 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.919
 in it neither appeared nor it becomes transparent 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.490
 by his attributes 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.110
 house wall 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.319
 I would vote 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.080
 since May it has been transparent 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.759
 Armadillo and Fred 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.759
 now the selection is taking classes 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.819
 to her 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.419
 and elsewhere 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.419
 another but one thing looks like six people 

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.130
 would require a numeric keypad 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.949
 so I felt pain 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.849
 on my foot 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.789
 This post subtracts 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.699
 the right loss 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.449
 he denied making any mistakes 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:19.729
 on the keyboard 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:20.979
 but OK 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.889
 five years 5 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.599
 six sides 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.599
 now 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.249
 to base the sky is leaning 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:38.800
 it was very easy 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.840
 and now a part 2 that will customize 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.919
 using coupes
