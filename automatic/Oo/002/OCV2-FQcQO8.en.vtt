00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.679
 and euro 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.679
 but to season 2002 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.410
 good how do you feel about the achievements 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 it is 1 but not no but no but yes no 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 happy 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 it's mostly because of what I see you see awards 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.610
 So much the regularity of being 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 always as much as training or 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 fast turn 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 so if this year has been at the level 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.980
 very good numerical because we have 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.260
 got many things with the team 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.690
 but we have lacked at the end of the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.750
 championship only I'm happy to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.990
 be here to receive this award with everyone 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.229
 you well many years that did not come and 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.570
 the last time was with a clash with two 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.180
 and a half so it was good to go back 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.060
 to see the faces again and nothing to see if 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 there is really luck next year and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.380
 we repeat one with one 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.420
 let's see if everything works well 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.090
 prepare well in the year and I think that 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.149
 still give up begins 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 first race you have to take it with 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.950
 calm because they are many days of training 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 although although there is a process are their 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 23 months processes that here there are not 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.869
 points not then there are that fast of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.000
 training is always look for the 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.729
 limit of the motorcycle and others but always 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.710
 with considering that the first 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.269
 race is in April and it's good that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.640
 you are up to that point what you have to 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.590
 to do is to prepare not 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.140
 you do not have to do any race before and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.180
 let's see if we can pass this on 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.700
 this moment or as we did the year 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.319
 past 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.830
 and then when the championship begins 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.629
 then to continue as we left the motorcycle 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.160
 new you just had to go around in 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.960
 Valencia 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.700
 and with that you go everything did not go to that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.820
 country for the following 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.900
 marc what did you think of the first impression 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.189
 with respect to the one that ends excellent 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.230
 good few changes now for now 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:46.980
 because good the regulation has changed 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.530
 with four things and the bike that we tested 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.110
 in valencia it was only about the prototype 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.420
 a little bit was not the ultimate bike 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.310
 neither now and when we start in 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.799
 malaysia is in february and we still have 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.910
 more we have to decide to define 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.620
 a lot of things 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.690
 the weights of the motorcycle are different 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 engines is one unless you have to look 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.960
 the consultative performance of the circle 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.860
 past the three kilos that they put 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.450
 Additional features 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.250
 punished in quite at the beginning of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.250
 year this year will change the story 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.770
 even more total are six but 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.050
 now we are not in it to see how how 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.900
 is the bike in malaysia if we can do 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.270
 some things so that for you to finish 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.430
 go well but good a process like every 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.010
 year and what's important is what I said 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.040
 before not now it's two three months of 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.069
 be there and then until they are not 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.999
 no points 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.129
 does not start the world really, so 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:48.200
 all three are important for one 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.980
 personally to prepare for the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.409
 team catch good habits but good 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.160
 at the end the races are what count 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.190
 and good a bit already to finish 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.290
 rivals it is clear that jorge be there and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.480
 is the mystery of seeing what the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.220
 valentino trade with the yamaha and then 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.140
 colleagues other than more if there 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.790
 expectations about 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.900
 and many others but good 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.139
 that and you and write pages 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.749
 imagination 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:27.810
 and I guess you have to see how the 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:30.810
 rivals for me but I'm pretty 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.120
 confident in my program and what I eat 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.120
 I prepare and what I do so palante
