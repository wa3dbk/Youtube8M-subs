opening of the picture frame now pour

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.240 
opening of the picture frame now pour
screen<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.390> really<00:01:29.660> easy<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.020> cut<00:01:30.260> but<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
screen is really easy to cut but you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.400 
screen is really easy to cut but you
probably<00:01:31.520> should<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.210> use<00:01:32.690> your<00:01:33.140> mother's

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410

best<00:01:33.710> pair<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.100> scissors<00:01:34.580> because<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.570> a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
best pair of scissors because it is a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.370 
best pair of scissors because it is a
little<00:01:35.900> bit<00:01:36.050> hard<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> blades<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:39.200> we

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
little bit hard on the blades so here we

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:49.410 
little bit hard on the blades so here we
go<00:01:39.410> cut<00:01:40.070> cut

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.399 

I'm<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.510> going<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.750> do<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:50.960> real<00:01:51.140> rough

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
I'm just going to do a real rough

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.440 
I'm just going to do a real rough
outline<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.280> then<00:01:52.490> trim<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.909> up<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.270> make<00:01:53.390> it

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
outline and then trim it up to make it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:04.330 
outline and then trim it up to make it
fit<00:01:53.780> better<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:56.479> opening<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.770> maybe<00:02:04.100> it's

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
fit better and the opening so maybe it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.610 
fit better and the opening so maybe it's
er<00:02:04.460> pipe<00:02:04.759> which<00:02:05.119> are<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.630> little<00:02:05.840> one

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
there you go you can see it fits right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.740 
there you go you can see it fits right

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the opening now you're just going to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.290 
the opening now you're just going to
take<00:02:17.900> some<00:02:17.959> hot<00:02:18.290> glue<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.100> run<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.940> around<00:02:20.030> the
