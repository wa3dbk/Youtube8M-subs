00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 Hello everyone and welcome to the lesson 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.730
 today we'll talk about a topic 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.800
 in my opinion very important because 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.380
 greatly affects the yield of yours 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.450
 alone, that is, not simply thinking 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.040
 to the notes you choose to build the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.809
 your phrasing but worry 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.059
 above all, instead, worry 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.350
 above all instead in the way in which 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.150
 you will then go to play the dynamic 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.160
 that you will use from the right hand 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.390
 the sound that will be affected in this 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.920
 case of opening and closing of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.360
 potentiometer I'm working with a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.880
 single sound or of the choice of the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 your pedals but above all from the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.899
 choice of the techniques that you will do then 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 the use of pebbles rather than 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.089
 tied rather than slides rather than 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.950
 bending rather than a tad bit of leverage 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.140
 all this obviously will contribute to 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.580
 color for the same night as yours 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.920
 phrasing completely 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.470
 different in one case than in another 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.090
 then now and you will hear a phrasing that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.430
 we will use as an example for the lesson 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.759
 of today played absolutely 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.910
 flat and I would say without any transport 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.910
 emotional 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.149
 this is a phrase according to me that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 executed so it has no effect not 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.680
 it has no musical sense of e 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 I would say it is not the least has not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.420
 minimally musical transport 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.420
 if instead we try to run it with 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.220
 with the use of bending some 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.439
 small break that I really am not 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.240
 of pauses understood as spaces 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:10.790
 added of silence but of the little ones 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:14.910
 detached if we use standard techniques 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.290
 I said bending the slide we succeed in 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.209
 better characterize ours 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.970
 phrasing is basically the same 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.970
 notes we can give more intensity 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:41.740
 rather than delicacy obviously in 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.320
 this sense can also help us 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:52.990
 equality of notes always a lifestyle choice 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:55.620
 comfortable a different one in this way 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.940
 I repeat, we realize how much 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.550
 the way we play the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.770
 our phrasing will affect the yield 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.290
 same as the phrasing much more second 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.360
 me that the simple and unique choice of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.520
 notes in this sense I respect neither rai a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.950
 take small musical phrases e 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.920
 try to give it different characters 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.080
 through the use of bending 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.250
 rather than slides rather than 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.910
 vibrated for our technical skills 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.910
 delegates 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.060
 and so on, because in my opinion this is 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 one of the points where it goes more 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.300
 researched the effectiveness of yours 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.140
 phrasing itself good work and good 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.140
 experimentation
