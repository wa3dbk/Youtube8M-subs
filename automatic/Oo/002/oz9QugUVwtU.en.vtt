00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.070
 is multitasking 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.860
 I'm playing the video in hd 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 maybe you can not see it in good hd by 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 the resolution that youtube handles but 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.149
 and good and the delays that maybe 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.789
 have but it really is very fluid 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.520
 well it's fully uploaded it does not have 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.170
 no delay I may repeat to the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.599
 time to watch it on YouTube is not some 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.799
 delay but really does not have it 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.799
