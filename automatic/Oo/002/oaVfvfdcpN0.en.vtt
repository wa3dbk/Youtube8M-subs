in your Applications folder and that

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.150 
in your Applications folder and that
will<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> chromecast<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.040> you're<00:01:08.040> going

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
will be the chromecast and you're going

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.780 
will be the chromecast and you're going
to<00:01:08.190> want<00:01:08.370> to<00:01:08.430> open<00:01:08.550> that<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.310> hit<00:01:11.310> accept

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to want to open that up and hit accept

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.130 
to want to open that up and hit accept
and<00:01:11.940> now<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.300> is<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.600> you'll<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> through

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and now this is where you'll go through

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
and now this is where you'll go through
the<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> will<00:01:14.070> find<00:01:14.370> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the things that will find your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.790 
the things that will find your
chromecast<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.410> have<00:01:16.530> one

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
chromecast I actually don't have one

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.230 
chromecast I actually don't have one
plugged<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:17.940> this<00:01:18.000> isn't<00:01:18.120> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
plugged in right now so this isn't a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
plugged in right now so this isn't a
good<00:01:18.360> example<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:19.530> frighten<00:01:19.860> your

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
good example but it will frighten your

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
good example but it will frighten your
chromecast<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.910> connect<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
chromecast and it will connect to it and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.470 
chromecast and it will connect to it and
then<00:01:22.350> you'll<00:01:22.500> type<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> things<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.610> as

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
then you'll type in the things and as

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.840 
then you'll type in the things and as
soon<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.380> done<00:01:25.410> but<00:01:26.070> also<00:01:26.190> need<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
soon as that is done but also need to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
soon as that is done but also need to
add<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.540> cast<00:01:27.960> extension<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.280> cast

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
add the cast extension now what the cast

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
add the cast extension now what the cast
extension<00:01:29.760> does<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.540> look<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.380> my

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.680 
extension does take a look up here in my
upper<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.160> hand<00:01:32.190> corner<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> screen<00:01:33.210> um

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
there is no streaming icon okay so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
there is no streaming icon okay so

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
icon so we're going to have to add that

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.910 
icon so we're going to have to add that
cast<00:01:41.370> extension<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:42.470> hang<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.620> there<00:01:43.650> you're

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
cast extension and hang in there you're

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380 
cast extension and hang in there you're
almost<00:01:44.040> done<00:01:44.370> just<00:01:44.400> add<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> cast<00:01:45.210> extension

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

almost done just add the cast extension
to<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.080> Chrome<00:01:46.350> okay<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.160> I'll<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.460> go

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to your Chrome okay so I'll just go

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.990 
to your Chrome okay so I'll just go
ahead<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.240> add<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.780> extension<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:50.000> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ahead and add the extension now it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.070 
ahead and add the extension now it's
very<00:01:51.150> important<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.600> add<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.810> extension

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
very important to add that extension

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.780 
very important to add that extension
because<00:01:52.410> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.830> have<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.190> then<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
because if you don't have it then you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.440 
because if you don't have it then you
can't<00:01:54.510> stream<00:01:54.780> what's<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.260> screen<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
can't stream what's on your screen and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.970 
can't stream what's on your screen and
I'll<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.200> hit<00:01:58.410> add

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:08.330 

and<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.330> adding<00:02:06.720> yep<00:02:07.050> bada-bing<00:02:07.800> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and I think it's adding yep bada-bing so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
and I think it's adding yep bada-bing so
now<00:02:08.490> you'll<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.880> have<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.600> option<00:02:10.350> I

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
now you'll see I have this option I

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.430 
now you'll see I have this option I
click<00:02:11.490> on<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.210> says<00:02:12.540> device<00:02:12.840> missing<00:02:13.290> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
click on here it says device missing but
