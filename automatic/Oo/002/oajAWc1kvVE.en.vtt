later part of the video so let's jump
into<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:58.940> software<00:00:59.390> bit<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.899> see<00:01:00.050> what<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
into this software bit and see what the

application looks like and what it can
do<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.019> there<00:01:03.260> are<00:01:03.379> two<00:01:03.589> camera<00:01:03.980> applications

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
do now there are two camera applications

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.970 
do now there are two camera applications
one<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.269> stock<00:01:05.540> application<00:01:06.230> that<00:01:06.740> comes

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
one is the stock application that comes

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.070 
one is the stock application that comes
loaded<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> phone<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.330> another

loaded in the in the phone and another

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.560 
loaded in the in the phone and another
one<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.530> called<00:01:10.190> charm<00:01:10.610> cam<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.180> again<00:01:11.390> we'll

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
one is called charm cam and again we'll

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.539 
one is called charm cam and again we'll
talk<00:01:11.750> about<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.200> but<00:01:12.470> first<00:01:12.799> let's<00:01:13.399> look

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
talk about this but first let's look

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.060

into<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.939> regular<00:01:14.450> camera<00:01:14.659> app<00:01:14.990> now<00:01:15.829> it's

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
into the regular camera app now it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.340 
into the regular camera app now it's
quite<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.399> tap<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.820> focus

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
quite a tap to focus

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.319 
quite a tap to focus
it's<00:01:18.710> called<00:01:18.950> zoom<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.579> you<00:01:19.640> can<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:20.030> pinch

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
and zoom in and zoom out and it's fairly

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.600 
and zoom in and zoom out and it's fairly
nice<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.320> know<00:01:24.439> if<00:01:24.560> you've<00:01:24.710> got<00:01:24.890> decent

lighting around even zoomed pictures so
it's<00:01:28.369> got<00:01:28.490> digital<00:01:28.850> 4x<00:01:29.630> zoom<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.990> quite<00:01:30.259> good

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's got digital 4x zoom is quite good

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.190 
it's got digital 4x zoom is quite good
actually<00:01:31.360> there's<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.420> quick<00:01:32.600> toggle<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
actually there's a quick toggle on the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
actually there's a quick toggle on the
left<00:01:33.409> -<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:34.310> know<00:01:34.430> enable<00:01:34.990> flash<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.399> button<00:01:37.399> to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
left - you know enable flash a button to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.039 
left - you know enable flash a button to
toggle<00:01:37.820> between<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.299> front<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.810> rear

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
toggle between the front and the rear

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.529 
toggle between the front and the rear
camera<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.829> quick<00:01:40.549> settings<00:01:40.939> right<00:01:41.149> on<00:01:41.299> top

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
camera and quick settings right on top

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.300 
camera and quick settings right on top
left<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.369> you've<00:01:43.369> got<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:45.350> shutter<00:01:45.560> key<00:01:45.829> now

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
left and you've got the shutter key now

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.100 
left and you've got the shutter key now
the<00:01:46.369> shutter<00:01:46.700> speeds<00:01:47.060> are<00:01:47.210> not<00:01:47.360> too<00:01:47.539> high<00:01:47.780> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the shutter speeds are not too high and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.749 
the shutter speeds are not too high and
this<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.680> probably<00:01:49.009> because<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:49.549> is<00:01:49.729> a

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
this is probably because this is a

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.819 
this is probably because this is a
review<00:01:50.180> unit<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.509> maybe<00:01:51.259> when<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.619> phone

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
review unit and maybe when the phone

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.950 
review unit and maybe when the phone
comes<00:01:52.070> out<00:01:52.219> in<00:01:52.369> January<00:01:52.689> you<00:01:53.689> know<00:01:53.780> they'll

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
comes out in January you know they'll

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.330 
comes out in January you know they'll
they'll<00:01:54.259> have<00:01:54.469> this<00:01:54.649> fixed<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.130> shutter

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
they'll have this fixed and the shutter

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.670 
they'll have this fixed and the shutter
speeds<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:55.759> going<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.000> be<00:01:56.090> much<00:01:56.270> higher<00:01:56.680> now

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
speeds are going to be much higher now

and here it is so this has been shot by
the<00:02:38.720> e7<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.560> I'll<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.430> honest<00:02:40.820> here<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.750> know

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
the e7 and I'll be honest here you know

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
the e7 and I'll be honest here you know
when<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.050> tap<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.800> wooden<00:02:43.160> stick<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.880> kind

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
when I tap on this wooden stick to kind

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.330 
when I tap on this wooden stick to kind
of<00:02:44.180> focus<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.320> see<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.770> there<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.130> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
of focus here you see that there is a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.210 
of focus here you see that there is a
slight<00:02:46.610> overexposure<00:02:47.620> behind<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.739> scene<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
slight overexposure behind the scene and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.360 
slight overexposure behind the scene and
then<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.550> kind<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.910> goes<00:02:50.390> back<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.530> again<00:02:51.860> you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
then it kind of goes back so again you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.770 
then it kind of goes back so again you
know<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.489> really<00:02:52.850> think<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.270> something<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
know I really think this is something to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.010 
know I really think this is something to
do<00:02:53.900> with<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.520> with<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.610> update<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.239> once<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
do with the with the update and once the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.199 
do with the with the update and once the
update<00:02:57.140> arises<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.100> actual<00:02:58.730> unit<00:02:58.970> comes

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
update arises and the actual unit comes

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.979 
update arises and the actual unit comes
in<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.290> problem<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.739> not<00:03:00.860> going<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> be<00:03:01.370> there

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
in this problem is not going to be there

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.270 
in this problem is not going to be there
so<00:03:02.989> let's<00:03:03.170> jump<00:03:03.380> into<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.709> camera<00:03:04.040> settings

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
so let's jump into the camera settings

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.580 
so let's jump into the camera settings
and<00:03:04.610> see<00:03:04.730> what<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:05.930> there<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.350> an

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and see what we have now there is an

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.190 
and see what we have now there is an
innovative<00:03:07.280> SR<00:03:07.970> auto<00:03:08.269> function<00:03:08.660> which<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.050> an

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
innovative SR auto function which is an

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080 
innovative SR auto function which is an
intelligent<00:03:09.739> Scene<00:03:09.980> Recognition<00:03:10.090> function

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
intelligent Scene Recognition function

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
intelligent Scene Recognition function
which<00:03:11.570> eliminates<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> hassle<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.830> changing

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
which eliminates the hassle of changing

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.100 
which eliminates the hassle of changing
the<00:03:13.370> settings<00:03:13.730> every<00:03:14.120> time<00:03:14.330> as<00:03:14.870> it
