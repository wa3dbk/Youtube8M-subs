this<00:02:08.940> pan<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> add<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.009> my

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
this pan and I'm going to add in my

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
this pan and I'm going to add in my
chopped<00:02:11.640> garlic<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
chopped garlic now as you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
chopped garlic now as you
see<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.920> olive<00:02:14.220> oil<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.580> hot<00:02:14.880> yet<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
see the olive oil is not hot yet and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.059 
see the olive oil is not hot yet and
that's<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.440> olive<00:02:16.740> oil<00:02:16.980> was

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
that's because if the olive oil was

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.770 
that's because if the olive oil was
really<00:02:17.280> hot<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.760> I'd<00:02:17.880> add<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.209> garlic<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
really hot and I'd add the garlic the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.030 
really hot and I'd add the garlic the
garlic<00:02:18.810> would<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.440> turned<00:02:19.650> brown<00:02:19.860> really

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
garlic would get turned brown really

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.070 
garlic would get turned brown really
quickly<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.640> they<00:02:20.760> would<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.090> infuse<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
