first came out and the story was one of

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.240 
first came out and the story was one of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
explain why over the years I have
developed<00:02:09.149> my<00:02:09.479> gaming<00:02:09.720> habits<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.289> around

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
developed my gaming habits a bit around

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.979 
developed my gaming habits a bit around
I'd<00:02:10.830> say<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> end<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.670> 2000<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.510> towards<00:02:12.840> up

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
I'd say the end of 2000 like towards up

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.030 
I'd say the end of 2000 like towards up
like<00:02:13.349> me

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
like me

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.459 
like me
and<00:02:14.219> towards<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:14.969> beginning<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.540> 2011

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
and towards the beginning of 2011

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.089 
and towards the beginning of 2011
perhaps<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.939> when<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> started<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.989> develop<00:02:19.680> my

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
perhaps is when I started to develop my

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.800 
perhaps is when I started to develop my
gaming<00:02:20.340> habits<00:02:20.670> into<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.879> more<00:02:21.150> mature<00:02:21.390> gamer

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
gaming habits into a more mature gamer

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.929 
gaming habits into a more mature gamer
investing<00:02:22.409> myself<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.859> the<00:02:22.950> story<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.549> worlds

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
investing myself in the story in worlds

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.059 
investing myself in the story in worlds
that<00:02:24.030> people<00:02:24.359> created<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.079> overall<00:02:25.709> enjoying

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that people created and overall enjoying

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.709 
that people created and overall enjoying
my<00:02:26.189> games<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.579> much<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.760> possible<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
my games as much as possible and that

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.089 
my games as much as possible and that
was<00:02:27.840> unfortunately<00:02:28.469> right<00:02:28.739> after<00:02:29.069> I

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
was unfortunately right after I

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.069 
was unfortunately right after I
completed<00:02:29.790> new<00:02:30.030> Vegas<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:30.750> didn't<00:02:31.019> get

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
completed new Vegas so it didn't get

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.809 
completed new Vegas so it didn't get
that<00:02:31.319> same<00:02:31.560> respect<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.159> naturally<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:32.640> was

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
that same respect so naturally I was

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.339 
that same respect so naturally I was
playing<00:02:33.060> new<00:02:33.180> Vegas<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.720> gameplay<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
playing new Vegas for the gameplay and

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.259 
playing new Vegas for the gameplay and
since<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.799> was<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.129> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.579> of<00:02:35.730> fall<00:02:35.939> 3

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
since it was just kind of more of fall 3

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.300 
since it was just kind of more of fall 3
I<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.540> wasn't<00:02:37.109> that<00:02:37.379> impressed

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I just wasn't that impressed

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.789 
I just wasn't that impressed
so<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.209> makes<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.569> special<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> mature

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
so what makes it special now to mature

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.990 
so what makes it special now to mature
matter<00:02:41.069> even<00:02:41.400> though<00:02:41.489> I'm<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.849> that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
matter even though I'm really not that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.449 
matter even though I'm really not that
mature<00:02:42.209> um<00:02:42.569> what<00:02:43.500> makes<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.010> special<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.430> me

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
was a that was a pretty good story but

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.750 
was a that was a pretty good story but

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
pathetic should really explore the paths

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.219 
pathetic should really explore the paths
like<00:03:38.250> obsidian<00:03:39.239> did<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> story

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
like obsidian did here in the story

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.170 
like obsidian did here in the story
where<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:41.010> choose<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.699> fate<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:41.970> the

where you choose the fate of the
wasteland<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.349> doesn't<00:03:43.709> involve<00:03:43.919> you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
wasteland and it doesn't involve you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.159

and<00:03:44.549> your<00:03:44.760> game<00:03:44.940> freakin<00:03:45.510> ending<00:03:45.810> at<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.959> end

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
and your game freakin ending at the end

which<00:03:46.379> is<00:03:46.500> another<00:03:46.739> mistake<00:03:47.129> that<00:03:47.310> new<00:03:47.430> Vegas

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
which is another mistake that new Vegas

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280 
which is another mistake that new Vegas
made<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.629> that's<00:03:48.720> kind<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.019> one<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.229> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
made and that's kind of one of the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.809 
made and that's kind of one of the
things<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.650> really<00:03:49.919> bothered<00:03:50.430> me<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.699> New

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
things that really bothered me with New

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.849 
things that really bothered me with New
Vegas<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.629> I<00:03:51.780> put<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.079> decent<00:03:52.590> amount<00:03:52.650> of

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
Vegas is that I put a decent amount of

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.080 
Vegas is that I put a decent amount of
hours<00:03:53.099> into<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.549> my<00:03:53.669> first<00:03:53.879> playthrough

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hours into it in my first playthrough

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.729 
hours into it in my first playthrough
even<00:03:54.540> though<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.629> really<00:03:54.959> wasn't<00:03:55.109> enjoying<00:03:55.560> it

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
even though I really wasn't enjoying it

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.469 
even though I really wasn't enjoying it
and<00:03:55.949> it's<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:56.639> I<00:03:56.669> kept<00:03:57.299> noticing

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
and it's just because I kept noticing

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.390 
and it's just because I kept noticing
things<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.079> was<00:03:58.169> like<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.979> it<00:03:59.189> was

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
things that I was like you know it was

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.589 
things that I was like you know it was
almost<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.699> Dead<00:03:59.879> Island<00:04:00.060> we're<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.449> Dead

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
almost like Dead Island we're in Dead

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.390 
almost like Dead Island we're in Dead
Island<00:04:00.750> 1<00:04:01.109> there<00:04:01.530> were<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> bunch<00:04:02.129> of<00:04:02.220> issues

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
Island 1 there were a bunch of issues

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.640 
Island 1 there were a bunch of issues
with<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.879> game<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.540> overall<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.049> idea<00:04:04.079> and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
with the game but overall the idea and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.069 
with the game but overall the idea and
the<00:04:04.799> gameplay<00:04:05.310> itself<00:04:05.579> was<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.090> fun<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.750> sound

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
the gameplay itself was so fun and sound

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.140 
the gameplay itself was so fun and sound
that<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:07.650> kind<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.040> overlooked<00:04:08.669> its<00:04:08.849> false

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
that I kind of overlooked its false

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.819 
that I kind of overlooked its false
because<00:04:09.449> I<00:04:09.599> knew<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.169> sequel<00:04:10.650> was

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
because I knew that that a sequel was

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.740 
because I knew that that a sequel was
coming<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.120> would<00:04:12.239> fix<00:04:12.540> those

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
coming and that it would fix those

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.059 
coming and that it would fix those
things<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.199> really<00:04:13.379> didn't<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.009> that's

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
things and it really didn't and that's

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.969 
things and it really didn't and that's
kind<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.579> Riptide<00:04:15.419> was<00:04:15.689> -<00:04:15.840> Dead<00:04:16.799> Island

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
kind of what Riptide was - Dead Island

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.339 
kind of what Riptide was - Dead Island
and<00:04:17.340> what<00:04:17.459> New<00:04:17.609> Vegas<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:18.150> -<00:04:18.329> fallout<00:04:18.659> 3<00:04:18.959> where

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
New Vegas kind of just took the engine

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.000 
New Vegas kind of just took the engine
took<00:04:21.449> some<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.169> know<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.409> story<00:04:22.710> and

together and add

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.890 
together and add
few<00:04:26.500> tweaks<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.880> kind<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.300> threw<00:04:28.510> me<00:04:28.540> off<00:04:28.660> a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.960 
few tweaks and it kind of threw me off a
little<00:04:29.020> bit<00:04:29.230> now<00:04:29.980> naturally<00:04:30.430> I've<00:04:30.550> discussed

yes they added the crafting system and

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.380 
yes they added the crafting system and
stuff<00:05:48.190> but<00:05:48.400> they<00:05:48.490> didn't<00:05:48.730> implement<00:05:49.240> it

properly<00:05:49.420> and<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.200> was<00:05:50.290> part<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.560> its<00:05:50.740> issue

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
properly and that was part of its issue

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.790 
properly and that was part of its issue
but<00:05:51.550> overall<00:05:51.910> I<00:05:52.180> still<00:05:52.510> enjoy<00:05:52.900> New<00:05:53.170> Vegas<00:05:53.320> um

but overall I still enjoy New Vegas um
it's<00:05:54.460> also<00:05:54.610> worth<00:05:54.880> mentioning<00:05:54.910> it<00:05:55.480> runs<00:05:55.930> a

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
it's also worth mentioning it runs a

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.300 
it's also worth mentioning it runs a
million<00:05:56.350> times<00:05:56.530> better<00:05:56.710> as<00:05:56.920> you<00:05:57.010> can<00:05:57.130> see<00:05:57.280> I

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
million times better as you can see I

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.010 
million times better as you can see I

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
think the game skipped like once for me

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.680

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
in this game while I'm recording it but
