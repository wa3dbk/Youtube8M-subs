00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.199
 hi all the boys always have me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 your 90 for a new bet 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.980
 of the angola and tech section dedicated to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.359
 Arab world and this day we go to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 discover two products that you are from 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 gamma hudgens that is k60 lm 62 census 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 means you know what revenge means 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 csai with the reason they never called it that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 this serious this range here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 but they are very good very much 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.610
 aggressive this norm k and emme in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 I think they are simply 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.649
 processing of keyword 60 and emme mouse 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 60 well then let's go right into the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.500
 detail let's see a little bit together 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.449
 what this keyboard that you 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 I confess that I had already discarded fact 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's not really the neo packaging 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 exactly like when you buy it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.910
 new though I think there is not there 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.289
 disturbs too much trouble after good 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 so let's see the first a little 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.489
 contents of the packaging that it presents 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 the classic keyboard as it should be 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.820
 the guarantee is a very useful one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 this guide is entirely useful 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.240
 use or better illustrates what 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.100
 we could find inside the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 pack but above the minimum a little 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.119
 this keyboard which presents a base in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 aluminum I had a lot of detail that yes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 you see you don't see much from anybody 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 part that a little strange is that it is not i 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080
 keys are not like saying immersed as 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.400
 we see 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.920
 obviously the texts have a frame vi 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 acts as a contour not here then nereto 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.250
 we have a very comfortable usb 2.0 socket 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.869
 if we had to because any 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 device that is a mouse everything is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 as soon as 6 be born a visa 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.409
 the key to disable windows two 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 USB connectors to connect ours 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.920
 motherboard to feed and to make 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.530
 work our weight there 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.720
 rear and curiously coated cables 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 really good thing but if we pass that 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.009
 this is a gem of this product 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 very narrow wrist rests obtained and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 which of course is very convenient if you play 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.680
 when you go instead to write it becomes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.360
 inconvenient though within this 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.670
 we find this object that allows 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 remove the keys and especially the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.170
 these keys are extra keys 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.430
 more marked by gaming use 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.870
 now anyway he showed me but 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.129
 especially this nastassia 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.530
 mechanical a mechanical keyboard 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.540
 present the share I switch call it 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.849
 red which is the best performing one 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.260
 in the red gaming ccee then the 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.209
 black however I had already illustrated how 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.489
 they worked before but now 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.870
 let's see these test the gang a bit like 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.370
 see the surface once will have a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.409
 different color however is more alive and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.250
 above all it presents a concavity which 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.269
 lets us go and use ours 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.040
 much more comfortable fingers 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.110
 certainly also in multiple quotes 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.180
 sure in short these keys are really 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.739
 geared to the game when you play are 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.720
 stupendous I like it a lot 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.040
 when writing better move on to these 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.109
 because when you enter those keys and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.489
 in my opinion they are slightly 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.260
 uncomfortable but really very curious 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.849
 this possibility of Italianness in the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.160
 pack of interchangeable buttons 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.069
 very fast and practical operation 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.960
 as you see it is done in a moment e 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.000
 especially also very beautiful a lot 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.410
 indicated to a player who plays a fps 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.330
 above all this and above all 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.400
 the indication of this keyboard from stand 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.050
 very good the cost around 100 euros 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.610
 and here before closing here is the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.870
 wrist rest attached and see how 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 very practical when you are 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.530
 play if you write becomes a little more 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.720
 uncomfortable now we pass do not know how 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.320
 call him the little brother not the m60 mouse 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 which is sold 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.290
 in short, in a couple that is present 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 first let's see something 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.220
 technician types to why what interests 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260
 always at all or 5,700 dpa and me 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.180
 I ask who plays accounts 5,700 dpa e 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.490
 you will become an idiot civati ​​always uses it 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.460
 much much less but above all has one 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.120
 hunt sensitivity of 100 of caio both yes 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.430
 can go to regulate in short, we are 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.650
 more than a hundred in 100 so we can 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.720
 make 1000 1100 1200 and so on 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.920
 but in short, inside the package like the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.470
 his very nice and his true 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.150
 guarantee they could via 9 keep it 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.280
 important and then always this 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.020
 illustration showing us some 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.300
 basic feature a small one 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.220
 usage guide to get started 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.710
 use it as for example turn on 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.300
 the pc and connect the mouse to ours 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.520
 beloved and unbelievable card I wouldn't have 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.810
 never said but let's not waste time 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.250
 let's see this a little bit 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.739
 first but use enough 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.720
 comfortable if not in the part in 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.560
 retro that having this autonomy a little 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.239
 particular 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.799
 to me it is a bit uncomfortable but we will see it 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.480
 now in the following images 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.730
 as you see now on the right side 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.870
 I find this crack at the bottom 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.510
 a bit uncomfortable but they are issues 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.680
 personal here is all this in or 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.940
 still really very nice and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.860
 above all the characteristic is this 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.840
 button on the left side that allows us 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.669
 to go and instantly reduce dpa 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.680
 in this it is very convenient in case 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.050
 maybe we had to go to a fps 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.120
 faults long distances where it is required 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.800
 greater precision or in any case can 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.110
 often be very useful with 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.669
 central plus more keys you will need to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.710
 go check maybe those that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.300
 the mouse is the mouse present 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.860
 a software in which we can adjust 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.840
 customize any powerful key 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.300
 success and this is really very convenient 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.010
 because I often handcuff a little cheese 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.820
 these things and have dedicated software 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.340
 the usb cable is very important there 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.930
 rigorously 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.940
 coated this is very important waves 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.639
 avoid uncomfortable folds but above all 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.220
 one thing that girls frets the mouse and 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.110
 lumia and if it lights up and cool and the mouse 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.699
 and illuminated this blue color 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.410
 when we see a little more at night than 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.780
 I don't see this anymore 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.310
 detail and not just another bonus 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.160
 important that we could go 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.600
 to adjust the weights of this but anyway 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.979
 the mouse that also presents this 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.960
 very characteristic aluminum base 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.240
 of this series hudgens of con six 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.770
 very nice also to see is a good one 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.050
 mouse I found myself pretty good though 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.760
 were it not for a slight annoyance in the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.350
 back and I recommend it 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.060
 here are the two products of today 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.330
 which we showed for the angle and tech 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.100
 that is k60 this keyboard and the m60 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.270
 this but I always have in mind the range 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.710
 venice that's all 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.630
 for the corner and technicians or as usual 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.330
 thank you for your attention in life if 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.080
 do you want hello to all guys a 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.520
 risk 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.020
 don't forget your pressures here 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.020
 below in the comments and you never know
