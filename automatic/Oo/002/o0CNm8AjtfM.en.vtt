00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
fruit seller tree in the past great idea

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.140 
fruit seller tree in the past great idea
in<00:00:11.670> theory

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
in theory

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690 
in theory
in<00:00:12.300> reality<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:13.349> believe<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:14.070> totally<00:00:14.429> crap

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
in reality we believe just totally crap

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
in reality we believe just totally crap
one<00:00:15.030> tree<00:00:15.240> will<00:00:15.389> take<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> great<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
one tree will take off and great the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
one tree will take off and great the
others<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:16.890> died<00:00:17.100> off<00:00:17.279> you'll<00:00:17.730> spend<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
others have died off you'll spend a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
others have died off you'll spend a
fortune<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.810> end<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.650> tree

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
fortune and end up with just one tree

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
fortune and end up with just one tree
now<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.090> double<00:00:21.480> grafted<00:00:21.900> trees

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
now there are some double grafted trees

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
now there are some double grafted trees
around<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.189> work<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.029> very

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
around that can work but you can be very

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
around that can work but you can be very
careful<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:25.019> sure<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.500> grow<00:00:25.680> evenly

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
careful to make sure they grow evenly

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.880 
careful to make sure they grow evenly
now<00:00:26.699> here's<00:00:27.000> an<00:00:27.119> idea<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.840> why<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.380> plant

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
now here's an idea for you why not plant

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.939 
now here's an idea for you why not plant
two<00:00:29.519> trees<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.630> hole<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.740> they

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
two trees in the one hole that way they

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.740 
two trees in the one hole that way they
have<00:00:32.099> their<00:00:32.250> own<00:00:32.279> root<00:00:32.640> systems<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.600> can

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
have their own root systems you can

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750 
have their own root systems you can
train<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.290> trunks<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> train<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> nice

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
train two trunks up and train a nice

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.200 
train two trunks up and train a nice
tree<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> top<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> single<00:00:37.860> tree

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
tree at the top as a single tree

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
tree at the top as a single tree
fantastic<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.809> instance<00:00:40.530> we're<00:00:40.800> going

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
fantastic in this instance we're going

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
fantastic in this instance we're going
to<00:00:41.010> plant<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.460> early<00:00:41.910> navel<00:00:42.300> orange<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
to plant an early navel orange and a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
to plant an early navel orange and a
late<00:00:43.590> navel<00:00:43.950> orange<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.550> wait<00:00:44.850> you'll<00:00:45.090> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
late navel orange that wait you'll have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
late navel orange that wait you'll have
fruit<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.140> side<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> tree<00:00:46.890> early<00:00:47.370> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
fruit on one side of the tree early in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.250 
fruit on one side of the tree early in
the<00:00:47.579> season<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> other<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> tree

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the season on the other side of the tree

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.479 
the season on the other side of the tree
it'll<00:00:49.469> fruit<00:00:49.739> later<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:50.370> have

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it'll fruit later so you'll have

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
it'll fruit later so you'll have
neighbors<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.480> longer<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.989> winter<00:00:52.320> now

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
neighbors for a lot longer in winter now

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
neighbors for a lot longer in winter now
here<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> plant<00:00:54.780> him<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
here where we're going to plant him it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.959 
here where we're going to plant him it
was<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.770> clay<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.579> we've<00:00:56.730> done

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
was a little bit clay so what we've done

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.060 
was a little bit clay so what we've done
is<00:00:57.030> we've<00:00:57.300> rounded<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.109> nice<00:00:58.320> band<00:00:58.770> along

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
is we've rounded up a nice band along

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
is we've rounded up a nice band along
here<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.090> way<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.480> drainage<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here and that way the drainage will be a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.680 
here and that way the drainage will be a
lot<00:01:01.469> better<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.070> improved<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.359> clay

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
lot better and improved if you have clay

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.140 
lot better and improved if you have clay
so<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> must<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> dig

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so it's a must to do this if you dig

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
so it's a must to do this if you dig
down<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> clay<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.590> really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
down into the clay all you're really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
down into the clay all you're really
doing<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.369> digging<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> big<00:01:09.000> bucket<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.689> well<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
doing is digging a big bucket or well of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
doing is digging a big bucket or well of
water<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.680> they'll<00:01:11.070> died<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.880> quickly

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
water and they'll died really quickly

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.350 
water and they'll died really quickly
all<00:01:12.630> citrus<00:01:12.990> love<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.950> drainage<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.030> what

we've done is we've dug a hole twice as
big<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.729> size<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> pot<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.340> we're<00:01:20.340> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
big as the size of the pot so we're just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
big as the size of the pot so we're just
going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.119> bags<00:01:21.390> off<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.500> you

can see this nice fresh roots then we'll
just<00:01:26.009> give<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> gentle<00:01:26.880> -<00:01:27.330> yeah

it<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.200> check<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.800> depth<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
it will just check it for depth now you

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.940 
it will just check it for depth now you
always<00:01:33.210> want<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.540> plan<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.050> same<00:01:34.350> depth<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
always want to plan at the same depth is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
always want to plan at the same depth is
what<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.610> bag<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.480> that's<00:01:36.630> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
close to the truth and then finally we

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.699 
close to the truth and then finally we
just<00:03:26.909> got<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.450> PVC<00:03:27.930> pipe<00:03:28.469> because

we get a few rabbits here and this is
just<00:03:31.769> an<00:03:31.890> AG<00:03:32.099> pipe<00:03:32.489> we're<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:33.719> of<00:03:33.750> sliding<00:03:34.170> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
just an AG pipe we're kind of sliding it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.160 
just an AG pipe we're kind of sliding it
we'll<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:35.969> put<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.299> around<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.629> trunk<00:03:36.900> like

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
we'll just put it around the trunk like

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.369 
we'll just put it around the trunk like
so<00:03:40.700> looks<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.790> bit<00:03:41.819> ugly<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.329> start<00:03:42.629> with<00:03:42.870> but

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.340 

there<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.490> go<00:03:59.700> once<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.720> trees<00:04:00.990> up<00:04:01.170> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
there we go once the trees up and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.020 
there we go once the trees up and
established<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.100> box<00:04:02.460> got<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> little

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
established and that box got a little

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.760 
established and that box got a little
bit<00:04:03.150> harder<00:04:03.510> after<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.840> couple<00:04:04.020> years<00:04:04.350> they<00:04:04.590> can

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
bit harder after a couple years they can

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.530 
bit harder after a couple years they can
come<00:04:05.040> off<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.670> it'll<00:04:05.820> be<00:04:05.940> fried<00:04:06.240> from<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.550 
rabbits there you have it two trees in
one<00:04:08.640> hole<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.330> have<00:04:09.360> early<00:04:09.870> neighbors<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.380> this

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
one hole we have early neighbors on this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.500 
one hole we have early neighbors on this
side<00:04:10.800> late<00:04:11.310> neighbors<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.030> side
