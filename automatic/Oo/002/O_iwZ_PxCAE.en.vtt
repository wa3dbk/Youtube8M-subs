00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
winners they come from relatively close

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.180 
winners they come from relatively close
fields<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:12.809> might<00:00:13.170> appear<00:00:13.500> similar<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
fields and they might appear similar to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.939 
fields and they might appear similar to
the<00:00:14.309> untrained<00:00:14.790> eye<00:00:15.059> sort<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.139> goths<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the untrained eye sort of like goths and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
the untrained eye sort of like goths and
emos<00:00:17.130> they<00:00:17.760> might<00:00:17.970> appear<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> same<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.990> they

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
emos they might appear the same but they

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
emos they might appear the same but they
are<00:00:19.289> completely<00:00:19.710> different<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.850> solely<00:00:21.180> clean

are completely different or solely clean
the<00:00:21.960> two<00:00:22.109> fields<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.590> science<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
the two fields are science and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
the two fields are science and
technology<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.710> most<00:00:25.890> awesome<00:00:26.490> thing

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
technology well the most awesome thing

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
technology well the most awesome thing
of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> week<00:00:27.000> comes<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.869> fuel<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
science get this a group of scientists

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
science get this a group of scientists
from<00:00:31.260> Harvard<00:00:31.740> University<00:00:31.910> actually<00:00:32.910> created

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
from Harvard University actually created

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
from Harvard University actually created
a<00:00:33.750> real<00:00:34.550> human<00:00:35.550> living<00:00:36.590> breathing<00:00:37.879> one<00:00:38.879> what

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a real human living breathing one what

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.869 
a real human living breathing one what
yeah<00:00:40.140> along<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> thing<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.430> allows<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
yeah along the thing that allows you to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
yeah along the thing that allows you to
breathing<00:00:42.120> allows<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> inhale<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
breathing allows you to inhale and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.160 
breathing allows you to inhale and
exhale<00:00:44.030> but<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.660> really

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
exhale but the thing is it's really

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
exhale but the thing is it's really
small<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.030> microscopic<00:00:48.030> little

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
small and it's on a microscopic little

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.410 
small and it's on a microscopic little
chip<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.590> potato<00:00:50.010> chips<00:00:50.070> no<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:51.030> an

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
chip what like potato chips no on an

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.590 
chip what like potato chips no on an
electronic<00:00:52.079> chip<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.520> small<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
electronic chip and it's this small and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.010 
electronic chip and it's this small and
that's<00:00:54.780> crazy<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.190> witchcraft<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.420> tell<00:00:57.780> you

unlike<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.710> other<00:01:16.860> bloke<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.580> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
unlike that other bloke I actually have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
unlike that other bloke I actually have
something<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.740> long<00:01:19.860> tube<00:01:20.130> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
something up here now the long tube is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.830 
something up here now the long tube is
translucent<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> allows<00:01:21.270> us<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.540> observe<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
translucent so it allows us to observe a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.149 
translucent so it allows us to observe a
human<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.290> without<00:01:22.439> having<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> surgically

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
human and without having to surgically

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
human and without having to surgically
invade<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> body<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> cool<00:01:24.479> ability<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
invade a body not a cool ability of the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.240 
invade a body not a cool ability of the
long<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> chip<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> predict<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
long the chip is to predict the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.850 
long the chip is to predict the
absorption<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.939> airborne<00:01:27.659> nanoparticle<00:01:28.619> but

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
absorption of airborne nanoparticle but

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
absorption of airborne nanoparticle but
wait<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.780> allows<00:01:31.170> us<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
wait there's more it also allows us to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
wait there's more it also allows us to
make<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.890> inflammatory<00:01:32.310> response<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
make the inflammatory response it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.050 
make the inflammatory response it
triggered<00:01:33.360> by<00:01:33.479> microbial<00:01:34.110> pathogens<00:01:35.060> what

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
triggered by microbial pathogens what

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
triggered by microbial pathogens what
let's<00:01:36.240> say<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> study<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> human<00:01:37.290> lung

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
let's say that the study of human lung

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
let's say that the study of human lung
would<00:01:37.650> become<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.040> easy<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.460> drinking

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
would become as easy as drinking

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
would become as easy as drinking
lemonade<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.780> very<00:01:39.930> hard<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
lemonade and it's not very hard now is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.620 
lemonade and it's not very hard now is
it

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.330 

that's<00:01:47.630> creepy<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.590> means<00:01:48.799> actually<00:01:49.039> do

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
that's creepy what it means actually do

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.889 
that's creepy what it means actually do
they<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:50.090> long<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.570> they

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
they have a little long now that they

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.469 
they have a little long now that they
can<00:01:51.079> test<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.649> every<00:01:52.490> purpose<00:01:52.759> without

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
can test for every purpose without

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.779 
can test for every purpose without
having<00:01:53.929> to<00:01:54.049> surgically<00:01:54.530> test<00:01:54.920> along<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.609> don't

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
having to surgically test along I don't

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.779 
having to surgically test along I don't
know<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.119> other<00:01:56.270> human<00:01:57.020> or<00:01:57.289> animal<00:01:57.920> in<00:01:58.609> any
