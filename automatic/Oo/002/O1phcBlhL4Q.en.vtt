00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Claudia is always having problems with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.000
 health department look for the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 central region of massaranduba 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 nevertheless the housewife complained of the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.559
 delay in delivery of the city hospital 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.070
 is actually what I found a copy of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.020
 A shame is because it was only made 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.100
 inauguration to make mayor's name 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 because when the population needs 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.439
 there is no hospital in fact what the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 people get there and see a farce the unit 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 was inaugurated in 2008 but 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.500
 never worked due to lack of approval 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 of state health surveillance 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 a final survey was carried out in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 December last year but the opening 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 of the space was also denied with the delay 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.450
 the city ​​government canceled the bidding and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 select institute a from iran 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.250
 to administer the hospital 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 the reason would be the need to change 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 the edict is always have to leave the team 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.800
 to another city is because you do not have 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.649
 my husband was hospitalized he was 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 diabetic patient was hospitalized several times 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 but everything in the village itoupava and exams 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.700
 because you do not have it right now because you 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.280
 I think this plays there is a lack 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.979
 of shame because so much solved 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 both hospital that is null and young in a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 hospital much older and massaranduba and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 itoupava villa also has a 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 hospital and oldest of Massaranduba 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 and it works because here the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.270
 what is missing 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.850
 is it in the interest of any politician 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 which is the city that has 15 thousand 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 people working with five stations 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.299
 care but so far in cases of 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 urgency and emergency patients are 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.299
 transferred to other cities as 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 South jaragua 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 the next step of the prefecture the creation 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 of a bill that will change the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.020
 profile of the entity that can administer 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 the hospital 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 the changes requested by the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.229
 State health must be met 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.090
 in the next few weeks, which 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.619
 sick child if you want to be hospitalized 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 something has to carry water has to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.229
 run to jaragua and here no longer 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 works that neither is a doctor here either 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.259
 general practitioner of the item you are looking for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.259
 another that also does not have
