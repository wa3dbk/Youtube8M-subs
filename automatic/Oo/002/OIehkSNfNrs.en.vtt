00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hi everyone, from here. 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 Who never had that will? 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.389
 so to attack a candy 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.089
 means not just to a sweet start 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 to grow like in Japan is another when 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 I see like a box of whole bonbon 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.769
 It is not always possible to have the ice cream when 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 returned to the end and then we will 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 discover that there are foods that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.250
 help to take away the desire to eat sweet 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.769
 people join to form a recipe 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.050
 function that comes in the form of a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.210
 ready champion does not need anything else 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 and that's what I'm going to teach you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.530
 never been that functional to take the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.920
 willingness to eat sweet with ingredients 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 Simple let's go for that recipe 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.270
 I'm going to need half a cup of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.989
 clarified butter also known 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 with a half-cup sugar tag 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.910
 brown half a cup of wheat flour 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.829
 integral 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.409
 an egg half a cup of half raisins 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 Cup of almond flour if you 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.040
 not find the almond flour can 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000
 use a whole cup of the flour 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.250
 whole wheat 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 Okay, you're not going to stop making a recipe for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.920
 here are three new lines 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 little niggling bites last a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 teaspoon of yeast 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 so to start the recipe we go 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 melt this butter that they have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.850
 functional properties 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.400
 it helps in the acid balance of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.009
 stomach does not know those people come to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.210
 burning butter reflux friend 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.320
 clarified in revenue can help 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.070
 here the brown sugar to be melted 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.070
 together with the butter 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.930
 butter is allowed with the sugar and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.720
 I hung up, I'm going to let it rest. 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.060
 while mixing the other ingredients 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.940
 This battery was a little tricky 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.860
 because in fact everything will be done to 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.020
 so we're going to put a wolf 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.040
 placed soon then we will put 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.370
 this mixture of butter and sugar 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.370
 brown 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.690
 following the whole wheat flour 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:33.110
 the almond flour 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.019
 Let's mix a little bit when we already 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.380
 has this homogeneous paste 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:49.519
 we will then put a spoonful of 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:52.430
 baking powder tea and stir again 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:56.510
 finally our dry ingredients 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 which are hamas indica I cut the apple 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.239
 I took a lemon thong she did not want 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.299
 know who does not know the blue 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:12.440
 raisins 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:14.600
 we finished mixing then that is already 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.900
 then a point to be placed in the 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.380
 you will need a form 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 ready to go to the pudica cacs 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.480
 of standard size and we will 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.989
 to fill each of these with our 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.989
 mixture 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:59.130
 and now we will put for 15 minutes in the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:04:02.370
 oven at the average power passed around 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:10.440
 from 15 to 20 minutes my here gave 20 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:13.170
 minutes and we can get people out 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.840
 Too bad the smell does not get there either 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 Say you want to, you 'll know 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.160
 What I'm talking about 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.710
 this thing time and is important but 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.220
 you can take a gaucho test with 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.470
 finger time you put your finger and 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.340
 back clay means you are already in the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.800
 Score 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.820
 if that be the little mark founded the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.950
 Tamoyo power is this tip I'm going to eat 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.360
 my corner cake to take away the will of 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.000
 God I'm already dying of desire 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.190
 eating sweet corn starch with that around here with 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.810
 only okay to not compromise the balance 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.810
 kiss the next
