earrings with great rustic appeal
shaping<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.880> hammering<00:00:09.300> wire

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.840 

so<00:00:15.040> the<00:00:15.130> first<00:00:15.370> thing<00:00:15.580> we're<00:00:15.760> going<00:00:15.910> to<00:00:16.240> do<00:00:16.540> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660 
so the first thing we're going to do is
shape<00:00:18.850> for<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.380> small<00:00:20.380> round<00:00:20.800> loop<00:00:21.220> at<00:00:21.460> the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
shape for the small round loop at the

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.850 
shape for the small round loop at the
top<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:22.150> our<00:00:22.330> wire<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:23.020> I'm<00:00:23.230> going<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.590> use

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
top of our wire and I'm going to use

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.980 
top of our wire and I'm going to use
these<00:00:24.189> pliers<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:25.060> I'm<00:00:25.180> going<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.570> put<00:00:25.840> the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
these pliers and I'm going to put the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.670 
these pliers and I'm going to put the
wire<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.590> little<00:00:27.189> past<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.869> I'm<00:00:29.170> just<00:00:29.380> going<00:00:29.619> to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
wire a little past and I'm just going to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.530 
wire a little past and I'm just going to
wrap<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.340> just<00:00:30.550> keep<00:00:31.500> tightening<00:00:32.500> as<00:00:32.800> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
wrap and you just keep tightening as you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350 
wrap and you just keep tightening as you
twist<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:35.140> then<00:00:35.290> loosen<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:36.130> move<00:00:36.430> I<00:00:36.880> want<00:00:37.180> my

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
twist and then loosen to move I want my

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.960 
twist and then loosen to move I want my
loop<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:38.110> be<00:00:38.140> round<00:00:38.559> all<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.370> way<00:00:39.550> around

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
loop to be round all the way around

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.870 
loop to be round all the way around
because<00:00:40.270> there's<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.660> point<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.290> reach

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
because there's a point that you reach

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.340 
because there's a point that you reach
where<00:00:42.880> you<00:00:43.000> can't<00:00:43.300> make<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.660> round<00:00:43.870> anymore

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
where you can't make it round anymore

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.920 
where you can't make it round anymore
you<00:00:44.559> see<00:00:44.739> where<00:00:44.890> this<00:00:45.040> is<00:00:45.100> straight<00:00:45.760> here<00:00:46.149> so<00:00:46.900> I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
you see where this is straight here so I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.170 
you see where this is straight here so I
made<00:00:47.170> sure<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.470> made<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.830> round<00:00:47.980> past<00:00:48.520> that<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.120> I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
made sure I made it round past that so I

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.540 
made sure I made it round past that so I
can<00:00:49.450> cut<00:00:49.660> off<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:50.110> straight<00:00:50.620> bit<00:00:50.860> so<00:00:51.340> I'm

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
can cut off that straight bit so I'm

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.240 
can cut off that straight bit so I'm
going<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.910> use<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.330> fairly<00:00:53.110> large<00:00:53.350> oval<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.070> this

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
going to use a fairly large oval in this

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.910 
going to use a fairly large oval in this
set<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.730> 26<00:00:55.450> millimeter<00:00:55.960> by<00:00:56.230> 20<00:00:56.760> millimeter

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
set the 26 millimeter by 20 millimeter

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160 
set the 26 millimeter by 20 millimeter
and<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:00.310> to<00:01:00.520> place<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.360> top<00:01:01.660> of<00:01:01.960> my

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
and I'm going to place the top of my

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.120 
and I'm going to place the top of my
loop<00:01:03.360> right<00:01:04.360> up<00:01:04.540> here<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.079> just<00:01:05.860> wrap<00:01:06.930> around

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
loop right up here and just wrap around

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.480 
loop right up here and just wrap around
the<00:01:09.130> mandrel<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:11.590> like<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.250> loop

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
the mandrel and just like in the loop

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.590 
the mandrel and just like in the loop
I'm<00:01:13.360> going<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.810> go<00:01:13.960> past<00:01:14.700> where<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:15.759> want<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:16.270> be

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
I'm going to go past where I want to be

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm going to go past where I want to be
so<00:01:16.899> that<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.170> wire<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.409> rounded<00:01:18.370> nicely<00:01:18.909> cut

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
so that the wire is rounded nicely cut

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.660 
so that the wire is rounded nicely cut
the<00:01:19.540> wire<00:01:19.750> right<00:01:20.229> where<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.740> meets<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.190> loop

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
the wire right where it meets that loop

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.530 
the wire right where it meets that loop
and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.680> I'm<00:01:23.770> going<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.040> repeat<00:01:24.280> up<00:01:24.820> here<00:01:25.330> on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and then I'm going to repeat up here on

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.620 
and then I'm going to repeat up here on
the<00:01:25.720> loop<00:01:25.960> now<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.770> next<00:01:27.159> step<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:28.360> bring

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
the loop now the next step is to bring

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.980 
the loop now the next step is to bring
in<00:01:28.840> your<00:01:29.050> bench<00:01:29.260> block<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.210> you're<00:01:31.479> chasing

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
in your bench block and you're chasing

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.570 
in your bench block and you're chasing
hammer<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.560> then<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.159> matter<00:01:33.190> of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
hammer and then it's just a matter of

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.640 
hammer and then it's just a matter of
pounding<00:01:34.390> all<00:01:34.690> around<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.799> flatten<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.549> out

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040 

going<00:01:40.490> til<00:01:40.730> it's<00:01:40.910> flattened<00:01:41.450> out<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.810> you

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
going til it's flattened out and you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.080 
going til it's flattened out and you
have<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> nice<00:01:42.470> even<00:01:42.830> thickness<00:01:42.980> all<00:01:43.730> around

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
have a nice even thickness all around

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.270 
have a nice even thickness all around
and<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.660> like<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.230> can<00:01:45.410> use<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.890> rounded

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
and if you like you can use the rounded

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.250 
and if you like you can use the rounded
side<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.670> your<00:01:46.820> hammer<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.780> give<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.140> this

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
side of your hammer and give it this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.890 
side of your hammer and give it this
nice<00:01:48.560> hammered<00:01:49.280> finish<00:01:49.490> pounding<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:50.570> around

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
nice hammered finish pounding all around

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.020 
nice hammered finish pounding all around
and<00:01:51.290> you'll<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.830> do<00:01:51.950> both<00:01:52.190> sides<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.910> do

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and you'll have to do both sides to do

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.900 
and you'll have to do both sides to do
that<00:01:53.270> once<00:01:53.960> that's<00:01:54.290> done<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.190> can<00:01:55.220> take<00:01:55.460> your

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
that once that's done you can take your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.740 
that once that's done you can take your
file<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.690> go<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.770> file<00:01:58.670> off<00:01:59.030> those<00:01:59.360> ends

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
file and go in and file off those ends

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.970 
file and go in and file off those ends
and<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.890> may<00:02:01.010> have<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.400> use<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> pair<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.000> pliers

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
and you may have to use a pair of pliers

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.060 
and you may have to use a pair of pliers
to<00:02:03.980> twist<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.640> end<00:02:05.170> in<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.620> that<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.890> meets

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
to twist that end in so that it meets

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.160 
to twist that end in so that it meets
the<00:02:07.250> frame<00:02:07.580> neatly<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.810> you've

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
the frame neatly so now that you've

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.620 
the frame neatly so now that you've
hammered<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.860> your<00:02:10.040> heart's<00:02:10.340> content<00:02:10.630> have

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
hammered to your heart's content have

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.960 
hammered to your heart's content have
shaped<00:02:12.110> your<00:02:12.290> frames<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.160> way<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.700> them

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
shaped your frames the way you like them

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.720 
shaped your frames the way you like them
and<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:14.240> filed<00:02:14.570> those<00:02:14.840> edges<00:02:15.410> smooth<00:02:15.890> it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and have filed those edges smooth it's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.080 
and have filed those edges smooth it's
time<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.330> add<00:02:17.480> beads<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.709> now<00:02:18.890> for<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> beads

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
time to add beads so now for the beads

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.470 
time to add beads so now for the beads
we<00:02:20.750> need<00:02:21.080> our<00:02:21.410> fine<00:02:21.830> gauge<00:02:22.250> wire<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.360> we're

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
we need our fine gauge wire and we're

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.210 
we need our fine gauge wire and we're
going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> take<00:02:24.050> one<00:02:24.320> end<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.800> our<00:02:24.950> piece<00:02:25.190> of

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
going to take one end of our piece of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.790 
going to take one end of our piece of
fine<00:02:25.700> gauge<00:02:26.000> wire<00:02:26.500> again<00:02:27.500> we're<00:02:27.650> going<00:02:27.740> to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
fine gauge wire again we're going to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.490 
fine gauge wire again we're going to
wrap<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.310> around<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:29.209> end<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> frame<00:02:30.140> with

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
wrap it around the end of the frame with

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.640 
wrap it around the end of the frame with
the<00:02:30.650> split<00:02:31.390> three<00:02:32.390> or<00:02:32.510> four<00:02:32.720> times<00:02:32.900> nice<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
the split three or four times nice and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.550 
the split three or four times nice and
tight<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.130> then<00:02:34.880> trim<00:02:35.300> off<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.750> excess<00:02:36.170> wire

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
tight and then trim off the excess wire

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.490 
tight and then trim off the excess wire
and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.760> string<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> bead<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.350> hold<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and then string on a bead and hold the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.670 
and then string on a bead and hold the
bead<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.190> outside<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.970> frame<00:02:44.239> and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
bead to the outside of the frame and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.830 
bead to the outside of the frame and
then<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.769> way<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.519> wrap<00:02:47.150> wire<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
then the way I like to wrap wire on a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.790 
then the way I like to wrap wire on a
closed<00:02:48.850> frame<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.600> poke<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.260> loop<00:02:51.500> with<00:02:51.769> my

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
closed frame is I poke up a loop with my

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
closed frame is I poke up a loop with my
finger<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:54.260> way<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.280> much<00:02:55.519> less

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
finger and that way you have much less

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.620 
finger and that way you have much less
chance<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.900> getting<00:02:57.850> kinks<00:02:58.850> if<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.150> find<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
chance of getting kinks if you find you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.190 
chance of getting kinks if you find you
have<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.840> loop<00:03:00.230> cross<00:03:00.590> over<00:03:01.040> itself<00:03:01.810> stop<00:03:02.810> right

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
have a loop cross over itself stop right

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.290 
have a loop cross over itself stop right
away<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.680> uncross<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.489> loop<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
away and uncross that loop because the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.070 
away and uncross that loop because the
loop<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.170> kink<00:03:06.620> waiting<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.190> happen<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.900> then

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
loop is a kink waiting to happen so then

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.910 
loop is a kink waiting to happen so then
we're<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> wrap<00:03:10.160> around<00:03:11.590> two<00:03:12.590> full

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
we're going to wrap around two full

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.559 
we're going to wrap around two full
wraps<00:03:13.250> between<00:03:13.880> each<00:03:14.120> bead

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.809 

and<00:03:20.569> then<00:03:20.840> string<00:03:21.410> on<00:03:21.590> another<00:03:21.620> beat<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:22.610> once

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
and then string on another beat so once

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.589 
and then string on another beat so once
again<00:03:23.030> hold<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.959> bead<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.730> again<00:03:25.970> poke

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
again hold the bead and then again poke

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.110 
again hold the bead and then again poke
up<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:28.519> wire<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:30.069> then<00:03:31.069> wrap<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.760> just

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
up the wire and then wrap and just

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.240 
up the wire and then wrap and just
repeat<00:03:32.510> going<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.560> way<00:03:33.590> around<00:03:34.040> your

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
repeat going all the way around your

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.490 
repeat going all the way around your
frame<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.000> then<00:03:35.150> when<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.420> end<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.380> way

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
frame and then when you end and the way

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.280 
frame and then when you end and the way
you<00:03:36.560> began<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:37.550> three<00:03:37.910> or<00:03:38.120> four<00:03:38.390> nice<00:03:38.870> tight

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
you began with three or four nice tight

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.949 
you began with three or four nice tight
wraps<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.489> once<00:03:40.700> you've<00:03:40.970> finished<00:03:41.239> all<00:03:41.690> your

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
wraps so once you've finished all your

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.089 
wraps so once you've finished all your
wraps<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:43.220> just<00:03:43.459> need<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.940> add<00:03:44.180> your<00:03:44.510> ear<00:03:44.690> wire

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
wraps you just need to add your ear wire

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.309 
wraps you just need to add your ear wire
use<00:03:46.099> a<00:03:46.370> pair<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.790> chain<00:03:46.849> nose<00:03:47.090> pliers<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:48.140> twist

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
use a pair of chain nose pliers to twist

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.740 
use a pair of chain nose pliers to twist
it<00:03:48.560> open<00:03:49.540> insert<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.780> loop<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.200> your<00:03:51.260> frame

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
