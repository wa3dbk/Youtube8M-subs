this is a design is that that I decided

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
this is a design is that that I decided
to<00:01:57.659> choose<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.409> bathing<00:01:58.590> suit<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.549> all

just um these are all rhinestones
painstakingly<00:02:03.479> hen<00:02:03.840> glued<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.680> by<00:02:04.890> one

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
painstakingly hen glued on one by one

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
painstakingly hen glued on one by one
and<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.700> goes<00:02:05.820> from<00:02:05.939> larger<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> bottom

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and it goes from larger at the bottom

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.369 
and it goes from larger at the bottom
doing<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> slow<00:02:08.509> gradient<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.989> smaller

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
doing like a slow gradient to smaller

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.979 
doing like a slow gradient to smaller
rhinestones<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.810> top

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
rhinestones so that's what the the top

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.020 
rhinestones so that's what the the top
the<00:02:13.110> bikini<00:02:13.410> looks<00:02:13.620> like

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the bikini looks like

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.650 
the bikini looks like
and<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.990> bottom<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.240> didn't<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.600> chance

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
and the bottom so I didn't get a chance

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.350 
and the bottom so I didn't get a chance
to<00:02:17.990> do<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.650> front<00:02:18.980> side<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.000> will

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
to do it on the front side but I will

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.790 
to do it on the front side but I will
definitely<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.810> doing<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.170> next<00:02:21.560> time<00:02:21.650> I'm

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
definitely be doing that next time I'm

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.350 
definitely be doing that next time I'm
going<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> bring<00:02:22.160> these<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.430> holidays<00:02:22.819> with<00:02:23.030> me

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
going to bring these on holidays with me

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.170 
going to bring these on holidays with me
so<00:02:24.080> these<00:02:25.010> worked<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.490> really<00:02:25.730> well<00:02:25.850> through

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
so these worked out really well through

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580 
so these worked out really well through
just<00:02:26.360> what<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.569> bathing<00:02:26.720> suit<00:02:27.020> looks<00:02:27.260> like

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
just what the bathing suit looks like

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.070 
just what the bathing suit looks like
actually<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.160> me<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.790> when<00:02:29.630> you're<00:02:29.750> far<00:02:29.990> away

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
actually on me and when you're far away

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.110 
actually on me and when you're far away
you<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.650> can't<00:02:30.860> tell<00:02:31.040> that's<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.400> DIY<00:02:31.640> suit

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
you really can't tell that's a DIY suit

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.280 
you really can't tell that's a DIY suit
you<00:02:32.300> would<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:32.540> think<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.930> somebody

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
you would just think that somebody

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
you would just think that somebody
purchased<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.860> somewhere<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> only<00:02:35.300> used<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
purchased it somewhere so I only used a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.000 
purchased it somewhere so I only used a
couple<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.989> different<00:02:36.319> things<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
couple of different things for the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.910 
couple of different things for the
bathing<00:02:37.130> suit<00:02:38.230> first<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.440> all<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.830> was

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
bathing suit first of all when I was

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.280 
bathing suit first of all when I was
testing<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.819> wanted<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.840> originally

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
testing it I wanted to do originally

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.350 
testing it I wanted to do originally
wavy<00:02:43.130> design<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.580> kind<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.850> went<00:02:44.000> back<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
wavy design it kind of went back and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.330 
wavy design it kind of went back and
forth<00:02:44.900> or<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.800> an<00:02:45.920> S<00:02:46.130> shape<00:02:46.489> or<00:02:47.300> squiggles

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
forth or like an S shape or squiggles

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.680 
forth or like an S shape or squiggles
but<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.370> don't<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.209> easier<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
but I don't know it was just easier to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.090 
but I don't know it was just easier to
do<00:02:50.780> straight<00:02:51.050> lines<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.500> me<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:51.950> was<00:02:52.070> just

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
do straight lines for me and I was just

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.979 
do straight lines for me and I was just
getting<00:02:52.370> kind<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.000> tired<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.600> testing

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
getting kind of tired of all the testing

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.680 
getting kind of tired of all the testing
so<00:02:54.820> instead<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.880> winging<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.420> just

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
so instead of winging it and just

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.479 
so instead of winging it and just
starting<00:02:57.019> by<00:02:57.290> gluing<00:02:57.620> rhinestones<00:02:58.100> on<00:02:58.280> which

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
starting by gluing rhinestones on which

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.850 
starting by gluing rhinestones on which
you<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.790> totally<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.330> well<00:02:59.540> I<00:03:00.350> decide<00:03:00.830> to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
you can totally do as well I decide to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.770 
you can totally do as well I decide to
use<00:03:00.980> double-sided<00:03:01.580> tape<00:03:01.850> put<00:03:02.120> rhinestones<00:03:02.269> on

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
use double-sided tape put rhinestones on

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.590 
use double-sided tape put rhinestones on
did<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.080> couple<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.440> different<00:03:03.860> test<00:03:04.760> strips<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
did a couple of different test strips so

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.420 
did a couple of different test strips so
I<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.870> did<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> think<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.220> did<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
I just did that so I think I did the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.460 
I just did that so I think I did the
first<00:03:07.670> four<00:03:08.150> or<00:03:08.300> five<00:03:08.510> rows<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.319> make

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
first four or five rows just to make

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.160 
first four or five rows just to make
sure<00:03:09.500> spacing<00:03:10.130> looked<00:03:10.310> okay<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:12.050> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
sure spacing looked okay that the

gradient from large to small rhinestones

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
gradient from large to small rhinestones
look<00:03:14.750> good<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.350> after<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.680> did<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.340> took

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
look good and after I did that I took

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.789 
look good and after I did that I took
off<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:16.970> double-sided<00:03:17.870> tape<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.290> just

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
off the double-sided tape and just

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.610 
off the double-sided tape and just
started<00:03:19.160> pasting<00:03:19.549> them<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.720> students

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
started pasting them on so the students

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.949 
started pasting them on so the students
I<00:03:24.620> guess<00:03:25.130> supplies<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:26.060> ingredients<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.810> two

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
I guess supplies not ingredients the two

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.360 
I guess supplies not ingredients the two
supplies<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.470> use<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.829> purchased<00:03:28.220> both

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
supplies that I use I purchased both

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.080 
supplies that I use I purchased both
from<00:03:28.579> Michaels

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090

from Michaels
and<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:31.100> rhinestone<00:03:31.549> set<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.910> I

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and this is the rhinestone set that I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.970 
and this is the rhinestone set that I
got<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.860> goes<00:03:33.920> from

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
got so you can see that it goes from

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
got so you can see that it goes from
very<00:03:34.340> large<00:03:34.549> rhinestones<00:03:35.180> all<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.750> way

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
very large rhinestones all the way

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.199 
very large rhinestones all the way
around<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.350> very<00:03:36.590> teeny<00:03:36.890> tiny<00:03:37.220> ones<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:38.000> was

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
around to very teeny tiny ones this was

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.210 
around to very teeny tiny ones this was
about<00:03:38.450> six<00:03:38.810> dollars<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.590> then<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.920> craft

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
about six dollars and then the craft

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.190 
about six dollars and then the craft
glue<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.579> used<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.940> put<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.239> on<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.019> did

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
glue that I used to put it on and I did

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.539 
glue that I used to put it on and I did
a<00:03:42.230> lot<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.440> research<00:03:42.829> on<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.040> different<00:03:43.340> craft

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
a lot of research on the different craft

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.729 
a lot of research on the different craft
booths<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.239> one<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.780> seems<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.530> be<00:03:45.620> one

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
booths and this one is seems to be one

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.830 
booths and this one is seems to be one
of<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.920> best<00:03:46.070> ones<00:03:46.370> out<00:03:46.519> there<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.540> Yi

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
of the best ones out there it's a Yi

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.710 
of the best ones out there it's a Yi
6000<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.760> picked<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:49.850> up<00:03:50.000> from<00:03:50.150> Michaels<00:03:50.600> I

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
6000 I picked this up from Michaels I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.569 
6000 I picked this up from Michaels I
think<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.049> about<00:03:51.200> 6<00:03:51.500> or<00:03:51.590> 7<00:03:51.650> bucks<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.190> well<00:03:52.340> it

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
think for about 6 or 7 bucks as well it

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.789 
think for about 6 or 7 bucks as well it
says<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:53.420> clear<00:03:53.750> flexible<00:03:54.109> paintable

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
says it's clear flexible paintable

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.710 
says it's clear flexible paintable
waterproof<00:03:55.400> non<00:03:55.700> flammable<00:03:55.940> safe<00:03:56.570> for

waterproof non flammable safe for

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.150 
waterproof non flammable safe for
photographs<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.410> it's<00:03:57.590> supposed<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
photographs and it's supposed to have a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.280 
photographs and it's supposed to have a
hella<00:03:58.430> strong<00:03:58.670> bond<00:03:59.060> on<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.390> so<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.660> decide<00:04:00.170> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
hella strong bond on it so I decide to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.039 
hella strong bond on it so I decide to
test<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:00.739> out<00:04:01.180> all<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.239> end<00:04:02.570> up<00:04:02.630> doing<00:04:02.780> was

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
test this out all I end up doing was

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.190 
test this out all I end up doing was
squeezing<00:04:03.440> out<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:04.400> good<00:04:04.940> key<00:04:05.660> size<00:04:05.900> amount

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
squeezing out a good key size amount

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.840 
squeezing out a good key size amount
onto<00:04:06.500> aluminum<00:04:06.829> 4<00:04:07.250> because<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.459> didn't<00:04:07.640> want<00:04:07.790> to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
onto aluminum 4 because I didn't want to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.000 
onto aluminum 4 because I didn't want to
leave<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> cap<00:04:08.239> on<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.810> risk<00:04:09.290> drying<00:04:09.859> it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
leave the cap on this and risk drying it

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.250 
leave the cap on this and risk drying it
out<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.400> took<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:11.120> toothpick<00:04:11.630> dip<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.109> toothpick

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
into the little blob and I applied it

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.300 
into the little blob and I applied it
directly<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.320> front<00:04:15.890> of<00:04:16.010> my<00:04:16.039> bathing
