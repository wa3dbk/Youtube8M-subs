one the outer skin to the inner there's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
one the outer skin to the inner there's
where<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> energy<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.620> used<00:00:56.059> as<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
where all the energy is used as a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.200 
where all the energy is used as a
tougher<00:00:57.570> skin<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> range<00:00:58.590> ball

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
tougher skin this is a range ball

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
tougher skin this is a range ball
happens<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> precept<00:01:01.140> range<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
happens to be a precept range ball which

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.060 
happens to be a precept range ball which
we<00:01:02.129> use<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> two<00:01:02.609> downs<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.350> sometimes<00:01:04.350> other

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
we use it two downs at sometimes other

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.899 
we use it two downs at sometimes other
manufacturers<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.799> top-flight

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
manufacturers also have them top-flight

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.500 
manufacturers also have them top-flight
Titleist<00:01:09.049> pinnacle<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.510> so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
Titleist pinnacle we use them all so

Titleist pinnacle we use them all so
which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> better<00:01:13.830> range<00:01:14.130> ball<00:01:14.460> don't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
which is the better range ball don't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
which is the better range ball don't
know<00:01:15.420> they're<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.320> about<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.890> same<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know they're all about the same for the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
know they're all about the same for the
range<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> toughness<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> durability<00:01:18.689> I'll

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
range and toughness and durability I'll

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
range and toughness and durability I'll
probably<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.280> trouble<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.820> saying<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
probably get in trouble for saying that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.190 
probably get in trouble for saying that
but<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:22.970> anyway<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.570> hard

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
