00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.910 

we<00:03:40.640> come<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.000> on<00:03:41.150> some<00:03:41.420> hard<00:03:41.600> times<00:03:41.690> my<00:03:42.590> husband

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
we come up on some hard times my husband

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.060 
we come up on some hard times my husband
and<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.460> we<00:03:43.550> decided<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.600> we<00:03:44.840> need<00:03:44.990> to

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
and I and we decided that we need to

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.000 
and I and we decided that we need to
solve<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.020> one<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> one<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
solve so this is one of the one of the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.150 
solve so this is one of the one of the
things<00:03:49.250> we<00:03:49.430> determine<00:03:50.270> that<00:03:50.300> we<00:03:50.480> can<00:03:51.160> work

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
things we determine that we can work

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.740 
things we determine that we can work
