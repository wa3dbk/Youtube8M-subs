00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.620
 and this all stopped on December 21 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.360
 what is the date the roadway us 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:33.150
 I pass you elsewhere but what I 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.070
 want it's just stolen because I 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.199

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.360

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770
 bars 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.120
 you're just you're afraid 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.630
 It's not complicated 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.630
 my country 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880
 m 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.880
 m 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.880
 m 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.570
