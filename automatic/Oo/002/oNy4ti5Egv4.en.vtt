00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.010
嗨I am the chief designer of the user interface of "Desperate Dimension 3" 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.470
 I will show you here the great features that are under development. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.510
 He is called the "weapons workbench" 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.000
 You will be able to assemble here 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.160
 Transform and share your guns 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.570
 This is really cool, come on! 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.580
 We always hope that Isaac can look like a real engineer. 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.410
 He is very smart, very smart and good at building things. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.010
 Based on this we try to make a workbench 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.210
 Plasma cutters are always just a tool for mining 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 Originally used to cut boulder 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.150
 Isaac was remade in some way to become his main weapon. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 In the first generation of "Desperate Dimensions" 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.360
 You can add Nodes to your weapon. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.040
 And improve the weapon according to the upgrade tree. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.000
 For example, let the gun load ammunition faster 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 Or make firepower stronger 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.940
 In fact, we let Isaac build weapons as much as possible in "Desperate Dimension 2". 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.800
 Just like his first flashlight and surgical tools assembled into his first weapon. 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.200
 We looked at what was done in "Desperate Dimension 1" and "Desperate Dimension 2" 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.190
 There is also a great workbench 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.990
 It is natural for us to evolve them into a new version of "Desperate Dimension 3". 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 We have rebuilt the weapon platform from the foundation. 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.300
 Not only can you upgrade your existing weapons 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.300
 In fact, you can build a weapon from scratch. 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.380
 Choose a frame like a heavy box 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.520
 Then we choose his engine 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 Like the "Tesla Core" engine 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 Will make the gun produce electromagnetic 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.650
 Then we think... well 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.560
 We can choose the main adapter 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.080
 That is the type of the tip of the gun 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.510
 We can choose what kind of electromagnetic tip we want to use. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.010
 We have all these different options 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800
 Let's use this. 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.780
 Then the secondary engine 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 We can choose what to use underneath 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.430
 How about choosing a fire? 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.020
 Good 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.080
 I like this gun 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.630
 Build it 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 The front end is under the electron with a fire 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.160
 Do you want a one-handed or two-handed gun? 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.020
 Give you! 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.320
 Do you want a plasma cutting engine? 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.320
 Do you want a Tesla Coil engine? 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.780
 Do you want a Ripper Core engine? 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 Give you! 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.250
 Do you want the Ripper Core to be plasma-cut at the front and then at the bottom? 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.010
 jump! Give you 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.000
 Shotgun or burning front core? 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.610
 You can build all of them yourself at the new workbench. 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.130
 Endless possibilities 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.000
 Redesign 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.050
 We know that some hardcore fans want to build and fine tune every part of their guns. 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.270
 We provide the ability to do this and drill and build the weapon you want. 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.550
 Just like before 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.620
 As for the players who want to create a gun with a single button, we have such a system. 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.280
 The blueprint is a schematic that allows you to create a gun with a single button. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.670
 Browse list 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.780
 Find what you want 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.900
 Oh! You got it 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.090
 There are Jesus &amp; Mary Chain Gun, Hot Death...etc. 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.550
 So when you want a plasma cutter 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.490
 All you have to do is make sure you have enough resources to build it. 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.160
 It seems that I have enough 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.810
 So...oh! 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 Build it 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.630
 Then... um, let's put it here. 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.180
 It is building 啰

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.040
 Then you leave the workbench 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.990
 In theory, there is a ready gun 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.840
 There is one over there I want to kill him! 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.010
 If you design a cool weapon in cooperation mode 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.710
 You can easily share blueprints 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.360
 Make it easy for your partner to build the same weapon
