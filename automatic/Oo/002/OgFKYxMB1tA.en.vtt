00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.970
 a wonderful product that everyone 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.740
 they want to drink because it's a lemon tea 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 The company's thermogenic 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 products that help your body 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.490
 Neveral internal temperature because 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320
 activates the thermostats there is a nutrient 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.560
 which is called the nicotine pto 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 chrome a little tangled but that is a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.770
 chrome healthy because there are other chromos 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 that are harmful and that pollute and that 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.800
 the company designed this food with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 spectacular lemon tea flavor what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 you can use as the water of the day 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.860
 that with the rich you know very easy to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 drink 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 I recommend that if you want to regulate your 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 sugar levels you take two to three 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.010
 daily times but if you want to burn 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.260
 fat that is taken at least five 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 lemon thermos people's daily glasses 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.190
 at the time you want a good hour 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.289
 it will always be m 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.510
 before half an hour before meals 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.909
 because how sugar regulates you in the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.339
 blood then you get to eat with less 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.619
 hungry with less anxiety you should take 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 every day is going to help you eliminate 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 you're going to feel like you're going to go to the bathroom 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 there are people who have come down a lot 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.360
 no more weight for the mere detail start 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.360
 to go to the bathroom to eliminate because they have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 problems of removing liquids 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.090
 in itself it is delicious to lose weight of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 sizes taking thermogenic from the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.230

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.270
 constant when you start to take no 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.160
 from stopping even one day take all 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or a 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.360
 only day serves us to take from Monday to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.010
 Friday and start again on Monday and not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.810
 take neither Saturdays nor Sundays you have to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.580
 take it every day so that the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.530
 the thermogenic effect and a something that you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.810
 you must feel is that you feel a heat 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.550
 weird and it's a weird internal heat 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.160
 strange then to regulate 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.660
