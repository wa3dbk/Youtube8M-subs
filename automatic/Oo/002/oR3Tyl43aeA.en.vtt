 7000 participants 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.739

 pass and where is your luck 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 to specify above all is that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.409
 exceptionally I could not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 shoot the draw live all 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.869
 simply because I am 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 currently on the move so 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.960
 I use my laptop that is not 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.290
 very very powerful 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 so they do not support the software of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 screenshot so unfortunately I 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 will not be able to film you this live 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.729
 leave I have not cheated you will have 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.979
 small screenshots of each of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 comments from people who have been 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.009

 obviously I know there will be a lot 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 unhappy not to have seen their 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.410
 names in this list but you know 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.410
 that you were very very very numerous 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.959
 so there is a tiny chance that it 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.440
 fall on you but as we say the wheel 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.060
 turned 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.910
 maybe next time it will be 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.340
 your turn in any case I solicit 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.470
