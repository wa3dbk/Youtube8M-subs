00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
out of chocolate and adding that red

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.670 
out of chocolate and adding that red
food<00:03:08.670> coloring<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:09.330> does<00:03:09.510> set<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.840> off<00:03:09.959> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
food coloring really does set it off you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.890 
food coloring really does set it off you
can't<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.069> much<00:03:11.280> deeper<00:03:11.610> richer<00:03:11.940> red<00:03:12.629> color

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
can't get much deeper richer red color

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.199 
can't get much deeper richer red color
by<00:03:13.110> using<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.560> powdered<00:03:14.010> food<00:03:14.190> coloring<00:03:14.640> as

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
by using the powdered food coloring as

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.400 
by using the powdered food coloring as
opposed<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> liquid<00:03:16.200> food<00:03:16.349> coloring

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
opposed to the liquid food coloring

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.380 
opposed to the liquid food coloring
which<00:03:16.800> I've<00:03:16.980> used<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.970> I've<00:03:18.030> only<00:03:18.090> got<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
which I've used but I've only got the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.940 
which I've used but I've only got the
liquid<00:03:18.690> stuff<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.470> what<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.680> used

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
liquid stuff so that's just what I used

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.190 
liquid stuff so that's just what I used
and<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.150> honest<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.510> still<00:03:21.690> works<00:03:21.840> out<00:03:22.019> fine

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and to be honest it still works out fine

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
and to be honest it still works out fine
but<00:03:22.769> when<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> use<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.340> liquid<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
but when you use the liquid or the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
but when you use the liquid or the
powder<00:03:24.390> these<00:03:24.989> pancakes<00:03:25.319> are<00:03:25.680> gonna<00:03:25.830> taste
