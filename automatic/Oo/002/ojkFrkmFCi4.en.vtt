00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello everyone came to me faithful 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.969
 dragged Volga 31 402 engine to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.370
 maybe what's so funny I wonder why 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.190
 i have a build 402 engine and i don't 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.160
 I will show it again to shoot it all 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.609
 just what's interesting to me even myself 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.949
 interesting engine jammed and jammed 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.599
 like a little man is such a fun day like you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 told in this drink and close all 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 he doesn't know occitan drink but I sure 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.620
 I do not know how the autopsy will show 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 and I think it will be interesting to someone that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 dna and stuck can the valve fell out not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.260
 I know I won’t be guessing and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.800
 in the course of the play when they take up 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 problem, I'll show you what it was drink 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 is a cleaning valve cover removed 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.699
 valve everything in place means that and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.949
 another drink before parsing so rented 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.400
 head and then it's spam as well 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.400
 attract and easier for this first with him 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:15.049
 take off the radiator as it consists and on 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.360
 here he will unscrew his mount now and I 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 from finish pipes and pulled 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 maybe someone will be interested in how 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.610
 remove the radiator see the radiator here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.020
 unscrew the bolts here these did not touch 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.470
 also average on the tube here and unscrewed 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.380
 diffuser diffuser up to 4 nuts 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.299
 below here still well here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.100
 just like that just take it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.039
 pull out the diffuser rest 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.979
 fan however 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:55.500
 you shoot the diffuser you hang on the fan 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.500
 and so here you take 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.899
 well shorter than the planets now i'm just 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.960
 I will take and pull out so simply no 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.390
 hand not convenient to shoot exam 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 understand this is a spoke radiator and then 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.890
 not mastic boldly rocker look here 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 here you have to always disassemble 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.810
 Pay attention immediately to when only 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.920
 with them immediately kind here see these here 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.170
 pusher or somehow call 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.269
 yoke these places here they are dry bitch 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.130
 here the mass of you does not go very badly 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:40.269
 these are the masters 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:45.180
 it is good, and then it turns to me here in Th 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:49.319
 oil oil oil 3 dry that's dry too 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.590
 is about to find it dry's 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.769
 look at the bar and you can see here too 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.760
 dry bar and honey on the tip 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:05.290
 and here it is dry here it is these in Moscow 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.230
 oil and here are 2 dry well bars not yet 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.879
 managed to develop only one 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.760
 steel dryish edition wipe it out 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.069
 all places are these channels and everything will be 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.010
 right here to pay attention 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.360
 sure you do not take this into account 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.360
 don't look at these things 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.680
 then even after assembling the engine on the VAZ in 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.080
 these places would rod quickly 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.989
 even though you can wear 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.890
 work silently will be slightly so noisy 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.099
 slightly quite when yo butter at all 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.989
 lives and works without oil will 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.980
 little such fate 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.140
 small little 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.739
 can't even draw on them 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:55.239
 attention on the bar quickly son I took off 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:59.430
 saw the head moving goes with here 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:05.440
 notice in this after 3 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.420
 now spins this here it fell 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.549
 saddle 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:15.060
 valve seat here I like 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:18.280
 ask a new time how to replace all 2 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.840
 I write here they do not change everything but 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.250
 why you see here she settled here 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.650
 he 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.550
 the village was us 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 and what's the matter look these villages changed 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.669
 I will not give anything at all I will not give even to see that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.210
 understood 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.460
 or the workshop can be changed 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.710
 not to see that he is completely new 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.979
 account here is the result she fell out 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.460
 so all yes if you are well I do not risk 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:05:00.530
 I'm all 2 well, like home conditions, if 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.380
 you risk then be very careful well 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.800
 I do n’t know I’m risking so that not from 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.660
 it was not me they do not change me 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.870
 sat down 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.539
 well here it is shorter than a bit to fall out 2 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.060
 that's all it is like an engine he said 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.229
 make the captain completely natural 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.789
 will take off and he pull out completely 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.849
 disassemble change piston if wave 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.870
 grinding there head naturally another 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.090
 I will report 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.820
 not even taken much let the worker 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.090
 good will find a lot of expensive 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:40.250
 disassembly from this can he find a good 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:43.900
 such a head naturally replaced him 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.599
 It's all well, that's Andrew, in short 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.510
 fell out the valve seat so she and 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.220
 it stuck well I turn this 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.610
 small was idle go to 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.760
 talking from class became especially garden 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.020
 he got it 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.539
 smashed to pieces in the piston all 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.340
 sick body well yes how to collect 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.460
 engine 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.460
 Now neither left you just like to remove 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.039
 I have this video to collect I will not 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.050
 on this dwell on morach because 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:24.260
 all the same now believe the same 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.940
 not even after assembly of the same if 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.580
 to gather when I make as if 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.820
 show your desire as he will 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.770
 work but that's when they didn't mean 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.180
 dolls or do it 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:42.169
 Well, I wish you all good luck 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.319
 all the best and here's the risk 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.259
 risk yourself from the saddle you know here 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:53.210
 such a thing may be why everything but I 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:57.080
 don't change though i can get these here 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:00.259
 I don't need any better, I don't want a man 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.569
 to do better so that you can 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.490
 you are one hundred percent sure and if not 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.520
 sure that 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.159
 today is such an infection that's there 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.930
 it turns out 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:14.270
 the life of him went down the dossier of all good 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.690
 and let you have a link like this never 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.690
 will not happen
