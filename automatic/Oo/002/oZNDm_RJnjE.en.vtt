bored<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.899> 22<00:01:07.770> inches<00:01:07.979> wide<00:01:08.160> for<00:01:08.369> somebody

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bored at 22 inches wide for somebody

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
bored at 22 inches wide for somebody
like<00:01:08.700> Riggs<00:01:09.030> Napoleon<00:01:09.539> because<00:01:10.050> in<00:01:10.259> he

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
like Riggs Napoleon because in he

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
like Riggs Napoleon because in he
doesn't<00:01:10.830> weigh<00:01:10.950> anything<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.149> we<00:01:12.420> made

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
doesn't weigh anything and then we made

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.130 
doesn't weigh anything and then we made
it<00:01:12.690> up<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> 31<00:01:13.170> inch<00:01:13.440> for<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.180> 290<00:01:15.180> pound<00:01:15.360> guy<00:01:15.539> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it up to 31 inch for a 290 pound guy so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the numbers and bend the curve so this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
the numbers and bend the curve so this

buckling<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.090> closeout<00:01:39.810> kind

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
buckling I know you know closeout kind

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.399 
buckling I know you know closeout kind
of<00:01:40.320> side<00:01:40.500> situation<00:01:41.570> but<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
of side situation but you do have to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.640 
of side situation but you do have to
have<00:01:43.439> them<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> board<00:01:43.920> back<00:01:44.270> they<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.420> hot

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
have them in the board back they get hot

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.679 
have them in the board back they get hot
so<00:01:46.650> what<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.420> colored<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.570> know

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so what if you put a colored you know

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
so what if you put a colored you know
like<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> white<00:01:49.079> coat<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like a white coat over it would it just

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
like a white coat over it would it just
add<00:01:50.759> too<00:01:50.880> much<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:52.229> bit

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
add too much way or make it a little bit

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
add too much way or make it a little bit
away<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.939> whole<00:01:54.090> reason<00:01:54.150> people<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
away and the whole reason people want a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
away and the whole reason people want a
fireman<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.170> keeping<00:01:55.439> rigid<00:01:55.680> lighting<00:01:56.100> ways

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
fireman is keeping rigid lighting ways

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.460 
fireman is keeping rigid lighting ways

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.850 
your carbon you got it polished out do
ya<00:02:08.570> do<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.899> think<00:02:09.080> that's<00:02:09.440> faster<00:02:09.830> than

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
ya do you think that's faster than

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.370 
ya do you think that's faster than
leaving<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.550> brush<00:02:10.990> there's<00:02:11.990> all<00:02:12.200> different

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
leaving it brush there's all different

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.020 
leaving it brush there's all different
theories<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.460> stuff<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.760> there's<00:02:16.760> always

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
theories and stuff and there's always

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.570 
theories and stuff and there's always
new<00:02:17.180> stuff<00:02:17.480> coming<00:02:17.510> up<00:02:18.070> we<00:02:19.070> do<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.220> guys<00:02:19.550> that

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
new stuff coming up we do have guys that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.970 
new stuff coming up we do have guys that
will<00:02:20.030> tape<00:02:20.540> off<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.990> they'll<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> really

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
will tape off and they'll do a really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.650 
will tape off and they'll do a really
light<00:02:22.220> wet<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.640> dry<00:02:22.820> lengthwise<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:25.660> you

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
light wet and dry lengthwise and you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
light wet and dry lengthwise and you
know<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.840> don't<00:02:27.020> want<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:28.550> something<00:02:28.820> up

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
know I don't want to make something up

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.940 
know I don't want to make something up
I've<00:02:29.209> heard<00:02:29.480> read<00:02:29.900> everything<00:02:30.350> different<00:02:30.800> and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
I've heard read everything different and

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.750 
I've heard read everything different and
they're<00:02:31.040> different<00:02:31.310> theories<00:02:31.610> they're

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
they're different theories they're

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.330 
they're different theories they're
different<00:02:32.030> feedback<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:33.560> finished<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
different feedback we finished the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.860 
different feedback we finished the
boards<00:02:34.580> out<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.120> look<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.570> resale

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
boards out because a look at the resale

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.960 
boards out because a look at the resale
on<00:02:35.930> them<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:37.190> do<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.459> guys<00:02:37.610> come<00:02:37.640> in

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
on them and we do have guys come in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.390 
on them and we do have guys come in
before<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.300> race<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.780> basically<00:02:39.709> clean<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.280> up

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
before a race and basically clean it up

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920 
before a race and basically clean it up
and<00:02:40.489> get<00:02:40.610> all<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> dust<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.120> oils<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.570> stuff

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
and get all the dust and oils and stuff

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.900 
and get all the dust and oils and stuff
off<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.680> go<00:02:42.770> lengthwise<00:02:43.280> well<00:02:43.550> like

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
off up and just go lengthwise well like

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.510 
off up and just go lengthwise well like
wet<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.239> dry<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.070> end<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.280> day<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
wet and dry but at the end of the day it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.060 
wet and dry but at the end of the day it
really<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.880> come<00:02:47.090> down<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.420> paddler<00:02:48.070> we

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
really just come down to the paddler we

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.540 
really just come down to the paddler we
can<00:02:49.280> get<00:02:49.459> one<00:02:49.610> more<00:02:49.850> or<00:02:50.480> wanna<00:02:50.950> miss<00:02:51.950> stroke<00:02:52.280> or

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
can get one more or wanna miss stroke or

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.580 
can get one more or wanna miss stroke or
one<00:02:52.730> drop<00:02:53.209> how<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.660> makes<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.959> race<00:02:54.110> as<00:02:54.290> much<00:02:54.470> as

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
one drop how it makes a race as much as

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.590 
one drop how it makes a race as much as
anything<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> you're<00:02:56.030> keeping<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.330> tails

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
anything so you're keeping the tails

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.270 
anything so you're keeping the tails
wide<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:57.050> these<00:02:57.200> things<00:02:57.680> yeah

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
wide on these things yeah

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.720 
wide on these things yeah
absolutely<00:02:58.790> 12<00:02:59.510> 6<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.930> 14<00:03:00.440> bring<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.160> but

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
absolutely 12 6 and 14 bring it in but

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.340 
absolutely 12 6 and 14 bring it in but
to<00:03:01.880> give<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.150> stability<00:03:02.390> as<00:03:02.780> well<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:03.200> need

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
to give this stability as well we need

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.740 
to give this stability as well we need
to<00:03:03.470> go<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.489> will<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> put<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> 14<00:03:05.420> into

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
to go so will you put a 14 into

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.240 
to go so will you put a 14 into
production<00:03:06.049> also<00:03:06.320> or<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:07.130> with<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
production also or just going with the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.060 
production also or just going with the
12<00:03:07.519> 64<00:03:07.850> now<00:03:08.000> we're<00:03:08.540> off<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.989> you're<00:03:09.860> trying<00:03:09.980> to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
12 64 now we're off to you're trying to

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.190 
12 64 now we're off to you're trying to
narrow<00:03:10.250> down<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.330> right<00:03:11.570> one<00:03:12.049> it

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
narrow down to that to the right one it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.350 
narrow down to that to the right one it
takes<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.620> lot<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:12.890> time<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.640> get<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> right

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
takes a lot of time to get the right

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.210 
takes a lot of time to get the right
board<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.959> rush<00:03:15.260> into<00:03:15.470> something<00:03:15.709> as<00:03:15.980> foolish

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
board and rush into something as foolish

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.150 
board and rush into something as foolish
because<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.640> takes<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:16.880> much<00:03:17.150> money<00:03:17.950> our<00:03:18.950> goal

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
because it takes so much money our goal

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.820 
because it takes so much money our goal
is<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.549> 14-foot<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.170> magic<00:03:21.620> like

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
is to get a 14-foot that is magic like

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.390 
is to get a 14-foot that is magic like
that<00:03:21.860> 12-6<00:03:22.580> it's<00:03:22.730> working<00:03:23.030> right<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:24.310> takes<00:03:25.310> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
that 12-6 it's working right now takes a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.850 
that 12-6 it's working right now takes a
lot<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.610> boards<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> magic<00:03:26.420> board<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.709> got

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
lot of boards to the magic board you got

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.140 
lot of boards to the magic board you got
to<00:03:27.950> do<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.160> numbers<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.670> run<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.910> same

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
to do the numbers and run that same

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.090 
to do the numbers and run that same
board<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.570> every<00:03:29.780> condition<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.500> look<00:03:30.950> at

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
board in every condition and look at

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.070 
board in every condition and look at
your<00:03:31.190> GPS<00:03:31.640> look<00:03:32.000> at<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> stability<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.690> seeing

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
your GPS look at the stability of seeing

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.930 
your GPS look at the stability of seeing
what<00:03:33.170> works<00:03:33.290> best<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.519> exact

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
what works best so this is the exact

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.130 
what works best so this is the exact
board<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.450> are<00:03:35.600> putting<00:03:35.930> into

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
board that you are putting into

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.039 
board that you are putting into
production<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:37.640> off<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.030> same<00:03:38.330> exact<00:03:38.780> oh

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
production it's off the same exact oh

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.550 
production it's off the same exact oh
yeah<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:40.000> basically<00:03:41.000> yeah<00:03:41.390> how<00:03:42.170> much<00:03:42.470> does

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
yeah it's basically yeah how much does

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.369 
yeah it's basically yeah how much does
this<00:03:42.680> one<00:03:42.860> away<00:03:42.950> carbon

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
this one away carbon

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.640 
this one away carbon
we<00:03:46.379> got<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> 21,000<00:03:47.519> over<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:48.420> be<00:03:48.569> caring<00:03:48.989> oh

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
we got a 21,000 over to be caring oh

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.819 
we got a 21,000 over to be caring oh
wait<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.159> 27<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.629> numbers<00:03:51.930> with<00:03:52.110> GPS<00:03:52.530> were

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
wait to 27 and the numbers with GPS were

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.369 
wait to 27 and the numbers with GPS were
almost<00:03:53.159> identical<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.840> only<00:03:54.989> difference<00:03:55.170> of

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
almost identical the only difference of

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.920 
almost identical the only difference of
God<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.709> speed<00:03:55.920> one<00:03:56.099> when<00:03:56.400> stroke<00:03:56.700> quicker<00:03:57.390> but

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
God to speed one when stroke quicker but

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.539 
God to speed one when stroke quicker but
then<00:03:58.079> that's<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.560> same<00:03:58.739> max<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.250> same

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
then that's the same max the same

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.910 
then that's the same max the same
average<00:03:59.730> speed<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.379> that<00:04:01.379> helps<00:04:01.650> though<00:04:01.769> one

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
average speed and that helps though one

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280 
average speed and that helps though one
stroke<00:04:02.159> quicker<00:04:02.659> especially<00:04:03.659> if<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.140> miss

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
stroke quicker especially if you miss

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.180 
stroke quicker especially if you miss
over<00:04:04.610> yeah<00:04:05.629> but<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:07.379> glide<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.799> them<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.069> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
over yeah but the glide on them and the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.640 
over yeah but the glide on them and the
heavier<00:04:08.489> board<00:04:08.730> was<00:04:09.390> awesome<00:04:09.810> plus<00:04:10.409> if<00:04:10.560> you
