00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
ingredients for these one of these might

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
ingredients for these one of these might
be<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> hard<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.410> find<00:00:37.710> where<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
be kind of hard to find where you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
be kind of hard to find where you
wherever<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.000> live<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.750> salt<00:00:40.530> water<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
then the masa flour masa harina and this

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.869 
then the masa flour masa harina and this
is<00:00:45.120> made<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.780> soaking<00:00:46.770> dried<00:00:47.129> corn<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
is made by soaking dried corn in a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
is made by soaking dried corn in a
solution<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.420> lime<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
solution of lime water and that's not I

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
solution of lime water and that's not I
don't<00:00:50.129> mean<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> fruit<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> calcium

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
don't mean like the fruit it's a calcium

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
don't mean like the fruit it's a calcium
hydroxide<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.500> strong

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
hydroxide which is a really strong

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.369 
hydroxide which is a really strong
alkalizing<00:00:53.430> agent<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.390> fluffs<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
alkalizing agent and it fluffs off the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
alkalizing agent and it fluffs off the
outer<00:00:55.620> hull<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> corn<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
outer hull of the corn and then that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
outer hull of the corn and then that
interior<00:00:58.079> meaty<00:00:58.739> part<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.340> ground<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.239> make

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
interior meaty part is ground up to make

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.450 
interior meaty part is ground up to make
the<00:01:00.780> masa<00:01:01.050> dough<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> sometimes<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> can

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the masa dough and sometimes you can

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
the masa dough and sometimes you can
find<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.730> already<00:01:03.090> made<00:01:03.270> sort<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
find that already made sort of like a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260 
find that already made sort of like a
big<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.309> know<00:01:05.339> probably<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:05.970> pound

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
big you know probably like a two pound

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880 
big you know probably like a two pound
bag<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.840> sort<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> play<00:01:07.439> dough<00:01:07.500> looking

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bag of sort of a play dough looking

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
bag of sort of a play dough looking
substance<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> dried<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.600> then

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
substance when that is dried and then

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
substance when that is dried and then
sort<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.880> repolarized<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
sort of like repolarized then you're and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
sort of like repolarized then you're and
you<00:01:13.049> end<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you end up with this so it's basically a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
you end up with this so it's basically a
flour<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.290> already<00:01:16.680> been<00:01:16.920> cooked<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
flour that's already been cooked if that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
flour that's already been cooked if that
makes<00:01:17.729> sense<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.299> cooked<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
makes sense it's been cooked by the the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
makes sense it's been cooked by the the
lime<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:20.850> today

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
lime that's what we're gonna use today

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.600 
lime that's what we're gonna use today
if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> find<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.220> already<00:01:23.220> prepared

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
if you can find the already prepared

if you can find the already prepared
masa<00:01:23.939> dough<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.890> I've<00:01:25.890> got

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
masa dough you can use that I've got

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
masa dough you can use that I've got
about<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.670> cup<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.299> that's<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.840> some<00:01:27.960> salt<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
about a cup here that's just some salt I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
about a cup here that's just some salt I
like<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> weigh<00:01:28.740> masa<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.270> absorb

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like to weigh masa because it can absorb

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.080 
like to weigh masa because it can absorb
water<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> humidity<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> air<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
water from the humidity in the air and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
water from the humidity in the air and
stuff<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:34.110> affect<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.530> much

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stuff and that will affect how much

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
stuff and that will affect how much
water<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> add<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:36.900> 4

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
water you need to add so for about 4

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
water you need to add so for about 4
ounces<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.590> masa<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> 28<00:01:39.180> times<00:01:39.390> 4<00:01:39.720> grams

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
ounces of masa which is 28 times 4 grams
which<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:41.780> 112<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.259> don't<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:44.180> we're<00:01:45.180> gonna

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
which is 112 I don't know we're gonna

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.929 
which is 112 I don't know we're gonna
probably<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.020> about<00:01:46.200> 2/3<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> cup<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.310> warm

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
probably use about 2/3 of a cup of warm

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
probably use about 2/3 of a cup of warm
water<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.869> warm<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> touch

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
water and this is just warm to the touch

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
water and this is just warm to the touch
but<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> start<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but I like to start out with just a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
but I like to start out with just a
little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.549> like<00:01:53.549> maybe<00:01:53.790> half<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
little bit at first like maybe half a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
little bit at first like maybe half a
cup<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.720> start<00:01:55.259> mixing<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> you'll

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cup and start mixing it out and you'll

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.190 
cup and start mixing it out and you'll
get<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> hang<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> you'll<00:01:57.780> start<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
get the hang of this you'll start to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
get the hang of this you'll start to
just<00:01:58.380> sort<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.460> pie<00:01:59.670> crust

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
just sort of know it's like pie crust

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
just sort of know it's like pie crust
where<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> few<00:02:01.740> times

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
where you just have to do it a few times

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.999 
where you just have to do it a few times
and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.520> you'll<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.329> right

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
and then you'll know what the right

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.580 
and then you'll know what the right
consistency<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.750> but<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
consistency is but it's really easy to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
consistency is but it's really easy to
work<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.740> corn<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.700> naturally<00:02:09.209> gluten<00:02:09.479> free

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
work with corn is naturally gluten free

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.229 
work with corn is naturally gluten free
so<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> great<00:02:10.560> thing<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.069> people<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
so this is a great thing for people that

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.990 
so this is a great thing for people that
have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
have
sensitivities<00:02:13.570> if<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.260> actually<00:02:14.410> had<00:02:14.650> like

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
sensitivities if you actually had like

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.080 
sensitivities if you actually had like
full-on<00:02:15.100> celiacs<00:02:15.550> or<00:02:15.700> something<00:02:15.970> you'd

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
full-on celiacs or something you'd

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.370 
full-on celiacs or something you'd
probably<00:02:16.180> want<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.630> some<00:02:16.690> kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.170> like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
probably want to get some kind of like

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.940 
probably want to get some kind of like
special<00:02:18.370> approved<00:02:19.030> Massa<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.380> hasn't<00:02:20.590> ever

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
special approved Massa that hasn't ever

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.470 
special approved Massa that hasn't ever
touched<00:02:21.310> anything<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.090> has<00:02:22.180> ever<00:02:22.330> touched

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
touched anything that has ever touched

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.970 
touched anything that has ever touched
wheat<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:24.780> regular<00:02:25.780> gluten<00:02:26.440> sensitivity

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
wheat but for regular gluten sensitivity

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.030 
wheat but for regular gluten sensitivity
I<00:02:27.040> think<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.490> probably<00:02:27.580> fine<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
I think this is probably fine so then

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.199 
I think this is probably fine so then
just<00:02:30.190> kind<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:30.520> your<00:02:30.610> hands<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:30.970> there<00:02:31.060> so

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
just kind of get your hands in there so

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.150 
just kind of get your hands in there so
you<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.330> start<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> feel<00:02:32.020> how<00:02:32.800> it's<00:02:32.980> coming

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
you can start to feel how it's coming

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.190 
you can start to feel how it's coming
together<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.570> we're<00:02:34.690> looking<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
together and what we're looking for is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.330 
together and what we're looking for is
something<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.500> obviously<00:02:35.890> holds<00:02:36.220> together

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
something that obviously holds together

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
something that obviously holds together
into<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> ball<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.270> isn't<00:02:37.540> sticky<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.380> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
into a ball but isn't sticky if it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.350 
into a ball but isn't sticky if it
starts<00:02:38.830> if<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.340> sticks<00:02:39.670> when<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.060> start<00:02:40.270> to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
starts if it sticks when you start to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
starts if it sticks when you start to
press<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.080> means<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.470> little

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
press it out that means it's a little

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.290 
press it out that means it's a little
bit<00:02:41.800> too<00:02:41.980> late'<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.880> sticks<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.240> your

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
bit too late' and if it sticks to your

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
bit too late' and if it sticks to your
hands<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.720> lot<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.200> little<00:02:44.410> bit<00:02:44.500> too<00:02:44.620> wet<00:02:44.800> I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
hands a lot it's a little bit too wet I

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.110 
hands a lot it's a little bit too wet I
think<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.220> might<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.459> overdone<00:02:45.670> my<00:02:45.940> water

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
think I might have overdone my water

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970 
think I might have overdone my water
something<00:02:46.480> add<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.600> little<00:02:46.840> bit<00:02:46.959> more<00:02:47.140> but<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
something add a little bit more but the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.410 
something add a little bit more but the
great<00:02:48.160> thing<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.370> because<00:02:48.880> there's<00:02:49.090> no<00:02:49.209> gluten

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
great thing is because there's no gluten

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.490 
great thing is because there's no gluten
in<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.870> don't<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.200> worry<00:02:50.410> about

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
in this you don't have to worry about

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.140 
in this you don't have to worry about
overworking<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.940> pie

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
overworking it like you do with a pie

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.229 
overworking it like you do with a pie
crust<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.570> never<00:02:52.750> gonna<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:53.080> tough<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:55.150> you

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
crust it's never gonna get tough so you

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.930 
crust it's never gonna get tough so you
can<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.600> play<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.739> day<00:02:56.770> long<00:02:57.070> just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
can just play with it all day long just

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.760 
can just play with it all day long just
play<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:58.540> yourself<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.110> your<00:02:59.230> masa<00:02:59.470> dough

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
play with yourself and your masa dough

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.199 
play with yourself and your masa dough
all<00:03:00.370> day<00:03:01.200> okay

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
all day okay

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.449 
all day okay
so<00:03:04.209> yeah<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.360> holds<00:03:04.600> together<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.400> not

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
so yeah it holds together but it's not

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.590 
so yeah it holds together but it's not
sticking<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.450> my<00:03:07.570> hands<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.140> lot<00:03:09.100> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
sticking to my hands a lot of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.850 
sticking to my hands a lot of
traditional<00:03:10.600> Mexican<00:03:10.989> cooks<00:03:11.170> will<00:03:11.470> actually

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
traditional Mexican cooks will actually

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.670 
traditional Mexican cooks will actually
pack<00:03:12.010> them<00:03:12.190> out<00:03:12.280> by<00:03:12.370> hand<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.060> takes

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
pack them out by hand but that takes

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.530 
pack them out by hand but that takes
probably<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.950> good<00:03:15.190> decade<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.790> practice<00:03:16.239> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
probably a good decade of practice and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.680 
probably a good decade of practice and
I'm<00:03:16.840> not<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.709> old<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:19.000> kidding<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.360> totally

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.560 
here pay attention so it's starting to
bubble<00:05:24.010> up<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.310> little<00:05:24.460> bit<00:05:24.640> and<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.270> edges

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
bubble up a little bit and the edges

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.900 
bubble up a little bit and the edges
start<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.110> like<00:05:26.290> curl<00:05:26.710> up<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.670> these<00:05:27.790> are

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
start to like curl up and these are

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.280 
start to like curl up and these are
traditionally<00:05:28.390> done<00:05:28.540> on<00:05:28.720> more<00:05:29.110> like<00:05:29.260> a

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
traditionally done on more like a

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.160 
traditionally done on more like a
griddle<00:05:29.710> like<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.980> kamal<00:05:30.790> flap<00:05:31.480> thing<00:05:31.780> but<00:05:32.140> i

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
griddle like a kamal flap thing but i

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.530 
griddle like a kamal flap thing but i
don't<00:05:32.470> actually<00:05:32.860> have<00:05:33.100> one<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.820> those<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.330> i

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
don't actually have one of those so i

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.050 
don't actually have one of those so i
use<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.720> cast-iron<00:05:35.080> skillet<00:05:35.610> but<00:05:36.610> i<00:05:36.760> use<00:05:36.910> that

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
use a cast-iron skillet but i use that

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.250 
use a cast-iron skillet but i use that
for<00:05:37.210> everything<00:05:37.510> so<00:05:37.720> i<00:05:37.750> guess<00:05:37.930> that's<00:05:38.050> not

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
for everything so i guess that's not

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.240 
for everything so i guess that's not
