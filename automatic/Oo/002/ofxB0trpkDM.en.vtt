get almost below the level / elbow so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.590 
get almost below the level / elbow so
you<00:01:27.800> come<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:28.610> she<00:01:28.850> has<00:01:29.030> no<00:01:29.060> kid<00:01:29.479> on

you come in like this she has no kid on
you<00:01:29.780> okay<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.710> skill<00:01:30.979> works<00:01:31.250> both<00:01:31.640> on<00:01:31.910> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
you okay this skill works both on the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.609 
you okay this skill works both on the
bank<00:01:32.270> -<00:01:32.390> flat<00:01:32.600> track<00:01:32.869> we're<00:01:33.290> going<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.470> show

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
bank - flat track we're going to show

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.230 
bank - flat track we're going to show
you<00:01:33.680> first<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.250> bank<00:01:34.460> track<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.940> reason

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you first on the bank track the reason

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.730 
you first on the bank track the reason
it<00:01:35.330> works<00:01:35.510> so<00:01:35.660> well<00:01:35.690> on<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.050> Bank<00:01:36.260> track<00:01:36.530> is

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
it works so well on the Bank track is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.350 
it works so well on the Bank track is
because<00:01:37.100> when<00:01:37.550> you're<00:01:37.700> hitting<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> bank

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
because when you're hitting on the bank

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.480 
because when you're hitting on the bank
track<00:01:38.630> uphill<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> tendency<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.280> hit

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
track uphill you have a tendency to hit

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.460 
track uphill you have a tendency to hit
with<00:01:40.670> your<00:01:40.820> shoulder<00:01:41.330> first<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.020> that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
with your shoulder first and that

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.010 
with your shoulder first and that
creates<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.100> little<00:01:43.369> triangle<00:01:44.000> if<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.690> get

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
creates a little triangle if you get

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.499 
creates a little triangle if you get
under<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.530> triangle<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.580> below<00:01:46.850> her<00:01:47.090> elbow

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
under that triangle and below her elbow

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.650 
under that triangle and below her elbow
you<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> free<00:01:48.560> shot<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.910> I<00:01:50.180> like<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.509> call

this<00:01:50.750> little<00:01:50.990> triangle<00:01:51.470> triangle<00:01:51.770> dip<00:01:52.600> this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
this little triangle triangle dip this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.630 
this little triangle triangle dip this
skill<00:01:53.960> does<00:01:54.200> also<00:01:54.680> work<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> flat<00:01:55.490> track

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
skill does also work on the flat track

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
skill does also work on the flat track
and<00:01:55.880> we'll<00:01:55.970> show<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.330> next

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.870 

we're<00:02:05.860> going<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.070> show<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:06.460> skill<00:02:06.760> on

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.170 
the flat track it's actually a little
bit<00:02:08.770> harder<00:02:09.070> on<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.280> flat<00:02:09.460> track<00:02:09.670> because

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
bit harder on the flat track because

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.790 
bit harder on the flat track because

track any part of their body can come at

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.510 
track any part of their body can come at
you<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.290> need<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.650> ready<00:02:14.860> for<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.190> one

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
you so you need to be ready for it one

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.770 
you so you need to be ready for it one
you<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:15.820> want<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.120> give<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.330> away<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.540> the

you don't want to give it away to the
very<00:02:16.810> last<00:02:17.290> second<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.980> two<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.460> want<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
very last second and two you want to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.250 
very last second and two you want to
make<00:02:18.820> sure<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.150> give<00:02:19.330> them<00:02:19.570> as<00:02:19.720> much<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.080> your

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
illegal target zone as possible so at

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.540 
illegal target zone as possible so at
the<00:02:22.270> very<00:02:22.300> least<00:02:22.660> when<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.710> do<00:02:23.770> hit<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.340> they

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
the very least when they do hit you they

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.430 
the very least when they do hit you they
are<00:02:24.610> contacting<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.570> an<00:02:25.690> illegal<00:02:26.020> spot

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
are contacting you in an illegal spot

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.559 
are contacting you in an illegal spot
and<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.830> could<00:02:27.040> pool<00:02:27.250> penalty<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.000> them

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.500 

so<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.780> was<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.019> bean<00:02:36.230> dip<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.160> review

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
so that was the bean dip just to review

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.000 
so that was the bean dip just to review
when<00:02:38.510> you're<00:02:38.660> coming<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.140> straight<00:02:39.620> whether

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
when you're coming in straight whether

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.800 
when you're coming in straight whether
you're<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.250> blocker<00:02:40.489> jammer<00:02:41.060> wait<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> last

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
you're a blocker jammer wait to the last

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.009 
you're a blocker jammer wait to the last
minute<00:02:42.200> get<00:02:42.860> close<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> blocker<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:44.750> low

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
minute get close to the blocker get low

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.380 
minute get close to the blocker get low
drop<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.069> shoulder<00:02:46.489> give<00:02:46.910> them<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> most

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
drop your shoulder give them the most

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.140 
drop your shoulder give them the most
illegal<00:02:47.930> target<00:02:48.530> zone<00:02:48.709> possible<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.550> then

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
illegal target zone possible and then

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.850 
illegal target zone possible and then
right<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.680> would<00:02:51.920> be<00:02:52.010> nice

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
right so that would be nice

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.969 
right so that would be nice
