00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello i'm philippe and today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 I show you a video to know 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 how to put your disk 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.309
 hard outer paste 32 since the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 hard drives that came in the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 trade on ntfs format and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 unfortunately mac can not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.550
 save data to the hard disk 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.039
 so we will change that so here you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 see that I have my hard drive that is 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 for my external hard drive which is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.849
 mounted so I'm going to look in my 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 hard drive inside my mac in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.570
 the applications folder that is there you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.180
 go in utilities then you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.540
 search useful disk utility top 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.379
 10 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.469
 and there we would like and there you see your 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.750
 your external hard drive that's here 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.780
 so you select where the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 mark is displayed then you go 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 on partitioning here to both masters 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.289
 current 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 you put a partition then in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.210
 options where we'll check though that's 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 be selected record of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 main boot what will allow 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.890
 to be able to save as much on 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.710
 windows only on mac 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.790
 then the format you have to put it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:28.189
 ms-back not so but you have a title that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.189
 you want and then 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.130
 then we will enforce 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.469
 thank 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.750
 So now here is the bar 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:46.930
 charge and we'll wait for that to happen 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 end here it's already done so 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.210
 now your hard drives that's here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.170
 look at the information there is 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.670
 now in fat32 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.899
 now you can close and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.289
 will show you now that he is 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.459
 possible to put a file was 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.810

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.220
