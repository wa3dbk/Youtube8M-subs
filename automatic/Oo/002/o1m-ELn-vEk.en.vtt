00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.850
 good 2002 to a good new video not 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:05.920
 attack to the world of video games is 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.559
 also more ridiculous than ever before 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.509
 well it seems that it is seeing see iii in 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.879
 the district attorney of marin in 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.619
 california has been bundled with what 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.199
 yes it was a brand of ice cream and also with 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.640
 the center for domestic peace this 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.900
 man, he basically proposes to the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.849
 families get rid of all the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.039
 violent video games that contain and 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.539
 besides, also violent weapons do not 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.150
 we could say for being the typical 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.039
 plastic knife ak-47 plastic 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.599
 not that they are the handsome ones when we are 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.300
 small and also that we bought the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.559
 out there plastic weapons all this not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.270
 when we want 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.980
 rambo that we put ammunition and other 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.110
 good countries, it's easier 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.270
 get real weapons not though 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.120
 although here we settle for the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.559
 of toy not there then in the USA 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.910
 normally, it usually comes with the 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.469
 cereal box and all this is more 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.390
 simple to get a real one and that of 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.100
 toys of the peel good as this 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.170
 man proposes to change all these 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.320
 violent video games and what it serves 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.449
 win the most violent the other way 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.340
 down the side and a ticket to the raffle 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.929
 that will be held stock 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.479
 out there for the center of peace 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:13.270
 domestic all this this man besides 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.219
 loose the barbarity that violence 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 domestic as it is generated also by 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.789
 violent video games something that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 I really have enough is enough 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.679
 doubt the truth before something I do not know 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.329
 quite a bit of laughter I did not decide 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.090
 affirm that without any study and 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.560
 no fucking bitch behind good 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.390
 this man says that all that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.359
 they see the children then later in their family 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.069
 they end up imitating him in their homes 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.420
 still not a long period of time 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.329
 time as for the video game 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.909
 supposedly violent realists have 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.130
 done because this change does not 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.189
 I mean, they're not going to spend so much 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.320
 both as long as for a 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.479
 person that we call me that I know 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.900
 grand theft auto because I already have a 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.370
 family with children and is forcing them to 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 stealing cars and other things is not something 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.310
 totally asshole say it without 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.170
 no type of study nor base nor 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 nothing is possible for children to post and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 they lie what they see at home but I do not believe 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.830
 that focuses on what are the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.430
 videogames I guess it's that the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.910
 young people with the medium and see radio with 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.280
 all the bad host I put on I suppose 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.959
 that the children then end up imitating 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.550
 I suppose habits like that of 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.930
 example I know we are going to put a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.370
 good habit and a bad habit 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.049
 example, the father forces him to the child 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 Brush your teeth every day to 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.129
 one hour then the best kid 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.959
 When he is older, you can see that he knows that 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.700
 that's a good habit and your children 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.190
 it forces them to brush their teeth 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.870
 the same aunts at the same time and that's it 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 it's not a habit that can really 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.099
 copy something bad that you can copy 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.239
 also what can be what 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.730
 better I do not know a habit that sees a lot and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.409
 that you can then say to imitate it because 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.540
 I think I think it's good even if it's 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.180
 bad I do not think that playing at 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.450
 violent video games really me that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.769
 let's call it a call of duty by 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.870
 example I do not think it does to the child 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.150
 after more you start killing 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.310
 people I do not know is that something is something 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.349
 totally asshole because if we 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.420
 we can say that the child avoid what 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.310
 see at home and video games are part 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.260
 of what is going to be at home then it goes 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.180
 to do fucking crazies this does not have 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.129
 fucking sense in my point neither feet nor 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.290
 head or you are son something software is me 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.670
 saying that you are going to roll up chains in 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.190
 hands are going to put knives and going to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.230
 limit every day at home cut 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.909
 heads to their children is that they do not 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.500
 I understand is that I go out and fucking 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.150
 incomprehensible and until now they do not have 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.670
 does not have necessary entity points 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 you do not see that attacking video games 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.659
 have to generate money or something in the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 counties in cities and in addition to 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:46.140
 us because it's something very unusual 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.209
 Well, the truth is it's difficult, it 's difficult 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.400
 all this because of course ice cream ben 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.129
 and jerry we're also good about 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.780
 the brand that and what the east has done 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.730
 Good thing I see it hard to read though 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.010
 another video game would change for a bit of 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.019
 side if you already have it a little bit I've made a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.579
 cone is a little bit like a betrayer to do 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.390
 this if they channel it for something else 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.390
 we still would not think about it 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.830
 and it is amazing that all this is a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 little too funny 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.500
 surrealistic because sometimes I wear this 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.209
 kind of news fuck you can not 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.579
 see them but then I start reading 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.049
 I'm going to see to contrast information and 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.139
 I realized that yes it is true not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.150
 is that he is impressive good chÃ¡vez 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.260
 this has been all nothing new in the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.260
 next video until next time
