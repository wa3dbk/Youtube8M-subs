00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello with you Elena and good 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.680
 recipes 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.010
 Today I have a review of this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.990
 unusual kitchen appliance 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.940
 spiral cutting sleep taxis looks like this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.020
 the box is a cross between 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.420
 mechanical blender and grater 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.680
 Now I will show how it looks 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.289
 rarely do you need to hold this pen 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.100
 rotate 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.160
 here so there are four modes of cutting 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 products in small spirals and more 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.809
 large this thing is very convenient for 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 decoration of various salads including 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 and fruit salads in a set there is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:57.829
 such a container that clings 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 down steel cutting here and fall into it 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.239
 products when cutting nothing nowhere 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.430
 crumbles nowhere splashing and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.020
 kitchen stays clean cutting have played 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.570
 instruction in Russian 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.700
 that is, you can understand very easily 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.200
 thanks to this instruction i am now 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 I will show how it spirals cutting 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 use here revolves is here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 ringlet can be adjusted thickness 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.330
 cutting spirals here you can see that there is no 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.330
 no teeth at all 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.450
 here on this mode you can get 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.450
 endless spiral now i will make of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:45.550
 pepper such a spiral laying here 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.440
 pepper close the lid and fix 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.950
 Pepper with this pen need 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.880
 to push 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.330
 pen on pepper and now need 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.330
 scroll through 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:08.250
 so scroll and pepper is cut 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 still need to gently press on the handle 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:28.319
 Well, look what happened turned 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.819
 here is such a long endless streak 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.569
 very convenient to dry such things in 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.840
 dehydrator 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.769
 and in the dryer for vegetables and onion fruits so 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:44.409
 you can cut and this long spiral 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:47.650
 dry very comfortable here so long 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.200
 The thing is also possible to decorate salads 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.859
 braids all weave in general very 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.730
 great is obtained from one pepper 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:03:00.129
 such a long strip right rope 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.000
 It turned out here on another mode honestly 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.000
 I cut the apple 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.890
 It turned out such a spiral too 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.410
 so long 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.270
 and here I can regulate the regime 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.860
 the width of the spirals is this first mode 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.870
 which showed with pepper he 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.310
 designed specifically for pepper and for 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.440
 Luke 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.330
 here on the other modes can be cut 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.030
 other vegetables and fruits 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.220
 the next mode is chop a cucumber from 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:55.130
 cucumber turned out such figures on 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:56.480
 This mode is up to how the moon is now for children 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.570
 really liked all sorts of things 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.819
 chopped cutting spirals and they with 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.730
 they eat with pleasure and now they 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.530
 eat up pepper 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.380
 well, on the last smallest mode 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.819
 convenient to make spaghetti raw food from 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.890
 zucchini or zucchini 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.290
 sorry right now I have no zucchini and it would be 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.269
 necessarily made to spiral sharp 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.690
 by the way offered in the recipe instructions 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.900
 these raw foodists are here necessarily 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.800
 cook such spaghetti with sauce 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.050
 avocado raw foodist but now zucchini and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.630
 we have no zucchini for sale as soon as 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.880
 I will buy and cook I think you 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.830
 I will show the recipe too 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.650
 must be tasty and healthy besides 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.229
 here this spiral and cutting can be washed in 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.180
 dishwasher although I don't know why 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.700
 you need to rinse it 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.240
 develops it all can not see 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.039
 need to wash in the dishwasher 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.990
 I want to emphasize that this is a spiral and 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.750
 dramatically made of plastic which is not 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.810
 sit down 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.910
 bisphenol and if you don't know the mounted 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.390
 it is a very harmful substance which 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.530
 found in many types of plastic and 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.160
 it cannot be used for 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.930
 cooking in this spiral cutting 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.540
 plastic without causing that is he 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 safe for health reference to the site 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.950
 online store where you can buy this 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 helix and cutting and other helix risk 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.600
 knot 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.080
