00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.950
 small tutorial on how to see the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 information on playstation 4 everything 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.829
 we record with both the catches and the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.839
 let's give the game that we install where is 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.550
 where is it good because this is very 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.339
 easy we have these bars here not 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.009
 we have we have give it up that you can 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.380
 see was up we're going to go to the 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.700
 toolbar and so on and we have 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.250
 to go in settings 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.380
 we are going to here 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 we have a series of options that you can 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.510
 see a lot of options but we have to 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.180
 go to the next management and 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 storage of the system in station 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.890
 ok we are there and here we have 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.150
 all the information that I have been saving 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.059
 in our console in both applications 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.489
 captures data from the application and the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.200
 Free space is shown by color 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.070
 so 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.330
 with respect to the to the general bar that 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 we have 407 total giant then of those of 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.320
 the 407 65 are from applications 28 of 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 catches and data ropes the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.510
 application 55 stick very little equipment 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.080
 must face it also because reform of 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.940
 colors and good we go as we can see and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 erase caused equipment is very easy to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.830
 We give the X 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.040
 and we can see the different things 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.350
 that we have not for example in punishment 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.560
 occupies 33 gigas nba live 11 this 8 and something 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.509
 is that 9 and something from 10 gigas 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.550
 already puts 10 if it does not get to put the three 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.450
 in guarantees in 1547 we go we want not to 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.450
 like this game 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.240
 as if we give it here it will come out 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.780
 information are valid if we want to see the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.280
 information the version for example if 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 for example we have a game for in 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.380
 productive and we do not know in what version 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.810
 is that we will give to here and the version 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.810
 here we have it worth 10 8 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.140
 and that to erase that what he does is very 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.060
 easy we give the button command option 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.060
 and eliminate vale 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.239
 we select what we want to eliminate 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.670
 we want to eliminate only that we can 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.970
 eliminate the car at once and eliminate 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.080
 will give us an option if we want to accept 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.560
 or not and we if we are to eliminate 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.590
 they were already eliminated very fast 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.459
 again in size and we already have a little 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.459
 more capacity 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.580
 more little things more cuisine capture let's go yes 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.480
 we have recorded a video clip 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.790
 how is it erased then very easy 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.150
 we have a series of video clips of all 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.510
 the game and we get into nba live 14 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.580
 let's go to it we are going to erase the clicks 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.980
 that we want we can give to the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.650
 X and we see the information is valid but 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 you are going to delete it the button options voucher 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.989
 of the remote control the command options button 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.450
 we give him and we have several little things 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.670
 We can see the information and eliminate it 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.079
 we remove and we can select what 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.920
 that we want to eliminate for example esther 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.140
 and west east and east for example and what 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.530
 we eliminate everything already it's worth we go eliminate 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.530
 everyone 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.180
 we eliminate we say yes and accept 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.210
 since there is no capture has already been removed and 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.590
 if we give it back 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.020
 and we really want no catches of 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.100
 video screenshot clips there 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.440
 We can do the same button options 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.730
 delete we can select then already 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.990
 all and we want to eliminate all 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.770
 we have here the option here above the 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.310
 right selected everything removed and you 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.310
 We said yes 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.590
 and already in the structure full psn candles 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.150
 ok because if you delete all the videos 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.420
 but yesterday a screenshot to 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.660
 third as it is not deleted everything follows 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.660
 appearing 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.770
 in agreement 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.280
 and application data guard that is 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.700
 this 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.680
 Well, they are all small data that 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.320
 they keep the games and others like 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.970
 saved games and here the cooking 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.990
 that you do not have anything because they occupy very 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.840
 bit 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.600
 if we want for example of the options 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.030
 that we have the first option data 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.660
 saved in the expiration of the system 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.720
 if you manage the saved data and you can 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.280
 be copied in such worth 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.200
 yes we want to pass it to other consoles 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.240
 we can save too we can also 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.610
 save it online 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.980
 the saved games we can the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.110
 first option the console to pass it on 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.300
 usb after the console we can pass 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.730
 to Internet 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.290
 if we have playstation plus and then in 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:22.169
 also in usb demonstration that you 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.779
 if you want to change the hard drive 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.939
 it is advisable to do this so that 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.879
 keep the saved items but 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.770
 I'll have to start from scratch and nothing 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.180
 this is all in this video I hope that 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.289
 have liked to see you in the next 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.289
