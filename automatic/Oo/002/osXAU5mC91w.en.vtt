I just love how light it feels which is
another<00:02:09.390> big<00:02:09.599> deal<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.959> I'm<00:02:10.019> just<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
another big deal so I'm just a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
another big deal so I'm just a
moisturizer<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:11.190> feel<00:02:11.400> oily<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.000> greasy

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and so they say they're supposed to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410 
and so they say they're supposed to
provide<00:02:14.099> light<00:02:14.310> coverage<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.300> put

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
provide light coverage but then you put

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.460 
provide light coverage but then you put
it<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> feel<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.349> skin

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.970 
it on and you feel like your skin
sweating<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.280> dying<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.410> okay<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.440> first

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

they're up third time I mean that focus
very<00:02:24.480> well<00:02:24.660> because<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.890> don't<00:02:26.370> know<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> just

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
very well because I don't know it just

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.199 
very well because I don't know it just
won't

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
won't

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.839 
won't
but<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:28.110> moisturizer<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:29.489> tinted

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
but this moisturizer this tinted

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.580 
but this moisturizer this tinted
moisturizer<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> darkest<00:02:30.989> shade<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.440> in

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
moisturizer is the darkest shade it's in

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070 
moisturizer is the darkest shade it's in
mocha<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:33.000> Laura<00:02:33.180> Mercier<00:02:33.480> typically<00:02:33.930> does

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
mocha the Laura Mercier typically does

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600 
mocha the Laura Mercier typically does
really<00:02:34.290> well<00:02:34.500> with<00:02:34.560> covering<00:02:35.069> darker<00:02:35.370> skin

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
really well with covering darker skin

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.979 
really well with covering darker skin
but<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> darkest<00:02:36.569> shade<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.810> have

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
but this is the darkest shade they have

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.569 
but this is the darkest shade they have
as<00:02:37.140> far<00:02:37.319> as<00:02:37.379> their<00:02:37.709> tinted<00:02:38.010> moisturizer<00:02:38.400> which

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
as far as their tinted moisturizer which

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.309 
as far as their tinted moisturizer which
I<00:02:38.730> wish<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.209> gave<00:02:39.360> us<00:02:39.510> darker<00:02:39.840> ones<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.200> they

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
I wish they gave us darker ones but they

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.250 
I wish they gave us darker ones but they
don't<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:41.130> reference<00:02:41.519> I'm<00:02:41.610> NW<00:02:42.150> 45<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.810> max<00:02:42.989> so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
don't for reference I'm NW 45 and max so

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
don't for reference I'm NW 45 and max so
I<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.470> there<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:43.829> women<00:02:43.950> way<00:02:44.280> darker<00:02:44.489> than

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I know there are women way darker than

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.729 
I know there are women way darker than
me<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.120> they<00:02:45.540> won't<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.810> able<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.380> this

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
me and they won't be able to have this

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.039 
me and they won't be able to have this
sense<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.220> moisturizer<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> sucks<00:02:48.450> but

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
sense of moisturizer so that sucks but

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.880 
sense of moisturizer so that sucks but
as<00:02:49.170> far<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:50.060> formula<00:02:51.060> goes<00:02:51.269> like<00:02:52.230> most<00:02:52.620> let<00:02:52.829> me

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
as far as formula goes like most let me

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.750 
as far as formula goes like most let me
get<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.160> closer

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
get a little closer

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.720 
get a little closer
as<00:02:54.299> far<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.750> formula<00:02:55.319> goes<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.920> applies<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
as far as formula goes it applies like a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.850 
as far as formula goes it applies like a
typical<00:02:57.030> tinted<00:02:57.480> moisturizer<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.590> very

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
typical tinted moisturizer it's very

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.430 
typical tinted moisturizer it's very
creamy<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.340> smooth<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:01.079> looks<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
creamy and smooth and this looks like a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.930 
creamy and smooth and this looks like a
lot<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.680> I've<00:03:01.890> applied<00:03:02.129> but<00:03:02.459> when<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.640> keep

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
lot that I've applied but when I keep

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.729 
lot that I've applied but when I keep
rubbing<00:03:03.269> you're<00:03:03.390> gonna<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.110> second<00:03:04.530> how

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
rubbing you're gonna see in a second how

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.089 
rubbing you're gonna see in a second how
well<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.190> blends<00:03:05.459> into<00:03:05.670> my<00:03:05.819> skin<00:03:06.739> with<00:03:07.739> very

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
well it blends into my skin with very

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.840 
well it blends into my skin with very
very<00:03:08.819> little<00:03:09.599> effort<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.430> actually<00:03:11.819> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
very little effort it's actually a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.340 
very little effort it's actually a
little<00:03:12.090> Golder<00:03:12.630> for<00:03:12.870> me<00:03:12.959> than<00:03:13.109> I<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.319> like

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
little Golder for me than I would like

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.879 
little Golder for me than I would like
but<00:03:13.920> when<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> use<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:14.760> powder<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.799> evens<00:03:16.799> out

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
but when I use my powder it evens out

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.680 
but when I use my powder it evens out
perfectly<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.609> skin<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.090> as<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.450> see

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
perfectly on my skin so as you can see

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.339 
perfectly on my skin so as you can see
