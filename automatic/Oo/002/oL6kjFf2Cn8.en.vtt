00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
a Circle Line here it is and there are a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.900 
a Circle Line here it is and there are a
few<00:00:16.049> radio<00:00:16.320> lines<00:00:17.090> here<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.240> are<00:00:19.490> going<00:00:20.490> from

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
few radio lines here they are going from

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.849 
few radio lines here they are going from
one<00:00:21.240> side<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> city<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> other<00:00:22.529> side

the sign go this way
here<00:03:44.920> we<00:03:45.040> need<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.310> change<00:03:45.489> again<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.300> look<00:03:46.870> at

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
here we need to change again and look at

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.110 
here we need to change again and look at
the<00:03:47.050> sign

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the sign

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.449 
the sign
this<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.629> rare<00:03:48.870> case<00:03:49.140> when

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
this is a rare case when

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.070 
this is a rare case when
with<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.510> color

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.290 

you<00:03:57.680> don't<00:03:57.860> need

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.030 

and<00:04:03.600> that's<00:04:03.810> where<00:04:03.990> we<00:04:04.080> need<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.260> go<00:04:04.500> all<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
and that's where we need to go all of

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.800 
and that's where we need to go all of
this<00:04:05.250> sign

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.940 

when<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.930> mean<00:04:14.110> when<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.650> change<00:04:14.890> the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
when you mean when you change the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.340 
when you mean when you change the
station's<00:04:15.550> make<00:04:15.760> sure<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.180> see<00:04:16.449> your<00:04:16.480> station

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
station's make sure you see your station

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.240 
station's make sure you see your station
on<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.280> sign<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.720> are<00:04:20.019> followed<00:04:20.410> we're<00:04:21.100> not

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
on the sign and are followed we're not

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.910 
on the sign and are followed we're not
gonna<00:04:21.430> go<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.699> this<00:04:22.000> apartment

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
gonna go to this apartment

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.860 
gonna go to this apartment
from<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.160> sign

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
from the sign

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.399 
from the sign
so<00:04:27.020> we<00:04:27.260> follow

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.189 

this<00:04:30.919> sign<00:04:31.219> here<00:04:31.580> means<00:04:31.849> that<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.169> a

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
this sign here means that this is a

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.610 
this sign here means that this is a
crossing<00:04:33.619> between<00:04:33.739> divine

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
crossing between divine

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.920 
crossing between divine
follow<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.220> Sun<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.910> when<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.750> cross

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
follow the Sun and when you cross

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.680 
follow the Sun and when you cross
between<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.650> stations<00:04:38.220> basically<00:04:38.760> just

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
between the stations basically just

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.670 
between the stations basically just
follow<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.050> crowd

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
follow the crowd

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.990 
follow the crowd
really

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
really

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:05.130 
really
they<00:04:42.570> all<00:04:42.780> more<00:04:43.200> in<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.500> same<00:04:43.650> direction

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.690 

patience<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.400> here<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.030> a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:19.170 

across<00:05:11.270> brain<00:05:14.110> and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.080 

she's<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.930> one
