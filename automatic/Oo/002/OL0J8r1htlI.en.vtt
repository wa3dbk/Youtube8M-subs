we<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> look<00:00:48.579> down<00:00:48.820> here<00:00:50.040> using<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:52.110> Lila

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
we have a look down here using the Lila

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.939 
we have a look down here using the Lila
three<00:00:53.470> at<00:00:53.590> one<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:55.629> using<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.470> switch

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
three at one I'm using that to switch

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.460 
three at one I'm using that to switch
between<00:00:57.220> my<00:00:57.550> pocket<00:00:58.180> guitars<00:00:58.570> now<00:00:59.230> basically

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
between my pocket guitars now basically

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.390 
between my pocket guitars now basically
the<00:01:00.339> reason<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:01.300> this<00:01:01.540> is<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:01.960> useful<00:01:02.860> for<00:01:03.070> me

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
the reason that this is so useful for me

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.779 
the reason that this is so useful for me
is<00:01:03.910> that<00:01:04.089> I'm<00:01:04.269> using<00:01:04.900> both<00:01:05.460> magnetic<00:01:06.460> pickups

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
is that I'm using both magnetic pickups

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.210 
is that I'm using both magnetic pickups
and<00:01:07.000> piezo<00:01:07.479> pickups<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.080> setting<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> mounted

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
and piezo pickups and setting a mounted

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.130 
and piezo pickups and setting a mounted
stereo<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:09.970> little<00:01:10.600> switcher<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.110> a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
stereo and the little switcher is a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
stereo and the little switcher is a
stereo<00:01:11.560> switcher<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.640> other<00:01:12.759> great<00:01:13.030> thing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
stereo switcher the other great thing

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.480 
stereo switcher the other great thing
about<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.600> unit<00:01:13.960> if<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.080> look<00:01:14.289> down<00:01:14.440> here<00:01:14.500> is

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
about the unit if you look down here is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.990 
about the unit if you look down here is
that<00:01:15.789> it's<00:01:16.750> got<00:01:16.930> two<00:01:17.200> hours<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.160> you<00:01:18.670> can

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
that it's got two hours so you can

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.340 
that it's got two hours so you can
switch<00:01:19.810> between<00:01:20.430> humane<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:23.110> that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
switch between humane and and that that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.080 
switch between humane and and that that
includes<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.830> acoustic<00:01:24.310> amp<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
includes the acoustic amp and the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.779 
includes the acoustic amp and the
electric<00:01:25.509> camp<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.140> then<00:01:26.979> if<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.550> switch

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
electric camp and then if you switch

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.070 
electric camp and then if you switch
again<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:30.479> tuner<00:01:31.479> which<00:01:31.660> isn't<00:01:31.840> plugged

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
again here tuner which isn't plugged

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.840 
again here tuner which isn't plugged
into<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.440> moment<00:01:32.649> but<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.130> get<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.670> general

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
into the moment but you get the general

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.320 
into the moment but you get the general
idea

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
idea

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.530 
idea
so<00:01:35.170> using<00:01:35.740> this<00:01:35.950> 3:1<00:01:36.490> that's<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.940> great<00:01:37.150> effect

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
so using this 3:1 that's a great effect

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.469 
so using this 3:1 that's a great effect
it's<00:01:38.500> it's<00:01:38.860> becoming<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.310> very<00:01:39.340> common<00:01:39.909> thing

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
it's it's becoming a very common thing

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's it's becoming a very common thing
for<00:01:40.509> guitarists<00:01:41.200> use<00:01:41.229> piezo<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.979> mags<00:01:42.189> and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
for guitarists use piezo and mags and

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.910 
for guitarists use piezo and mags and
stereo<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:44.020> stereo<00:01:44.409> setups

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
stereo in stereo setups

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.789 
stereo in stereo setups
so<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.750> found<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.110> pedal<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.470> was<00:01:47.590> really

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
so when I found this pedal I was really

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.219 
so when I found this pedal I was really
I<00:01:48.040> was<00:01:48.130> extremely<00:01:48.939> excited<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.689> I<00:01:49.960> couldn't

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
I was extremely excited that I couldn't

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.600 
I was extremely excited that I couldn't
do<00:01:50.380> all<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.560> switching<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.130> needed<00:01:51.490> to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
do all the switching that I needed to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.160 
do all the switching that I needed to
because<00:01:51.909> before<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:52.450> was<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.570> nightmare

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
because before this it was a nightmare

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.249 
because before this it was a nightmare
then<00:01:54.009> I'm<00:01:54.340> using<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.970> Lila<00:01:55.479> Sunday<00:01:55.930> driver

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
then I'm using the Lila Sunday driver

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.690 
then I'm using the Lila Sunday driver
just<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> buffer<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.189> booster<00:01:57.520> really

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
just for a buffer and booster really

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.480 
just for a buffer and booster really
cleans<00:01:58.060> up<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.360> sound<00:01:58.630> very<00:01:58.960> nicely<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.799> then

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
cleans up the sound very nicely and then

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.280 
cleans up the sound very nicely and then
I<00:02:00.520> always<00:02:00.790> keep<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.240> peace<00:02:01.479> plate<00:02:01.780> over<00:02:01.990> here

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
I always keep the peace plate over here

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.620 
I always keep the peace plate over here
