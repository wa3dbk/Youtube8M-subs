this<00:01:11.820> cheat<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:12.810> why<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this cheat and I think that's why I have

this cheat and I think that's why I have
it<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.920> him<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.700> number<00:01:14.880> 5<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.080> was

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it as him as number 5 because this was

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.030 
it as him as number 5 because this was
back<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.689> repeat<00:01:19.229> the
