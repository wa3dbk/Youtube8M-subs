00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.880
 more to the channel in today's video as 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.920
 you saw here below in the title I bring you 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.940
 the game of beauty secrets the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 beauty secrets that what you do 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.340
 twice a year 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.010
 May and October I more or less believe and good 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.470
 is that you buy something that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.300
 discount they make the value of what would be 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.820
 20 percent of the purchase and the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.199
 next purchase you discount that value 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.550
 I 'll give you a little card with 20 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.220
 percent of the purchase you've made for 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.720
 discount on the next purchase despite 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.730
 have the English cut and I already tell you 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.020
 are usually twice a year and that's it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.160
 I have not even one hundred percent of 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.739
 Staff discount that they make to me 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.500
 for working for the English court as well 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.210
 that the truth is that they devastate me money 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 and there are products that came out very very 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.190
 well of price first of all I'm going to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.140
 teach this product from bobby braun 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.449
 I really wanted to have it is a 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.440
 shimmer break and I took the nectar tone 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.300
 because it's a shade like orange or so and 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.299
 good are the colors that I use the most 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 the colors in orange tones of corals 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.430
 then the truth is that this product 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.320
 in none I wanted to catch it in this tone 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.060
 precisely to combine it as 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.399
 illuminator when using colors or 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.780
 blushes of that type and to apply it 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.409
 on top of some matesi blusher I want 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.690
 Give a little light or light, not like that 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.850
 how good I caught this tone is the simÃ© 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.659
 brick in the nectar tone as I tell you 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.710
 I had to order it because it was not there 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.659
 so great because it takes me came 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.650
 just for the beauty writings and very 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.320
 all right 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.300
 t 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 this was the product that I bought so 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.840
 here are the staff discount not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 had no discount to apply well 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.830
 that I stayed at 39 with 95 but its 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.830
 Actual price is 47 euros 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.810
 It's very nice you know that I'm passionate 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.179
 the illuminators can be picked up by 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.759
 separated together and you can go building 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.740
 different tones and the truth is that I 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.259
 So it seems very cool and the truth is very 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.869
 versatile and I love me too 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.520
 I took these two lipsticks Maybelline's 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.479
 it's true that it worked really well for me because 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 was the second unit at 25% and what 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.599
 I deducted my discount and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.080
 staff and others I stayed both 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.209
 for six euros with 20 when in truth 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 It costs eleven euros each, that is, 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.709
 I had to leave for 22 euros and I 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.250
 went out for 6 with 20 I picked up two shades 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.310
 this is the 110 hibiscus haven is this 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 candy pink and union yang yang 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.849
 It is very beautiful and the truth is that the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.420
 lips are pretty nice to wear 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.420
 this would be one of them 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.790
 in the camera do not get into kandi but it's 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.460
 more candy than you see there there you see 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.520
 a little off and this is the 400 tone 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.980
 You're in coral that is also very 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.980
 very very nice this color I liked a lot 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.110
 there it is and good the truth is that 22 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.340
 euros that should have cost me 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.290
 6 with 20 what else can you ask for like this 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.970
 that these two products on the other hand in 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.850
 to also catch some little thing in the first 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.040
 place I took this palette is a palette of 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.260
 shadows of the fixed linear is called pink 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.440
 freeze and good I had enough desire to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 have it its price is 41 euros but it 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.340
 I stayed in 25 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.340
 is this palette here I reflect 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.680
 the spotlights are these four tones 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.910
 and the truth is that I love has 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.910
 very nice colors 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.870
 and this I have not put it well 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.290
 I do not know the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.390
 very much the attention and good not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.950
 had any quartet like this from Mac's 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.140
 that they are already made that such fate 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 loose shadows that went stacking and good 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.680
 This has a price of 41 euros and I tell you 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.360
 but it stayed on 25 after I fucked 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.160
 these two lipsticks I had to have 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.370
 left for 39 euros both because 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.230
 They cost 19 50 each but I stayed 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.480
 in 24 24 with 94 25 euros 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.110
 are these two on the one hand with the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.110
 patisserie for what is called for 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.310
 replenish it because mine has said up 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.950
 here it's over so good I got it 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.070
 on the one hand the putt and being and they are 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.330
 Lovely lipstick you already know a lip color 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.550
 very pretty 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.850
 makes like an aspect of the perfect lip 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.770
 it's a lovely color here on the other hand 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.140
 I caught the hero because you have good 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 it's still very nice it's from the mom you 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.480
 forgive me the country x the luster range 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.550
 gloss and the euro / yen is the matte range and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.740
 Well, it's a lipstick that I think has 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.000
 been very famous and came out collection and what 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.400
 they retired and well when they leave this 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.930
 collection do not hesitate to pick it up because 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.430
 then they are those typical things of the 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.470
 that you regret not having not 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.140
 caught so I'm going to make a swap 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.300
 there so that you see it is a very color 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.430
 nice that does not go unnoticed from 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.580
 then 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.080
 and there it is I do not think it's as blue as 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.800
 It comes out on camera but good colors to 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.800
 times in the camera 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.750
 very nice it would sound very nice and good 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.250
 I tell you that they came out at 25 the two 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.170
 so pretty good at the end of the charge 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.640
 they discount one site from the other and 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.740
 last and the last thing I bought with the 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.620
 money that with the last card that I 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.720
 it was I think I do not have the ticket because 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.950
 I bought this another day 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.830
 and in those days where you no longer 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.860
 accumulated you could only change and the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.770
 ticket I should not have it here I do not have 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.470
 tickets of everything up to which I believe 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.540
 but I do not have tickets for this 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.200
 well, it does not matter, I think it has a 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.200
 price of 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:01.360
 33 32 I do not know and well it came out I do not know 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.110
 for lying something too 23 24 I do not 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 agreement 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.280
 and well I'm talking about the illuminator 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.930
 Albatross has the same packaging 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.320
 that the blushes but I think it 's a 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.970
 obvious illuminator this this here and the 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.320
 truth that is very beautiful is not a 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.729
 very natural illuminator the truth that 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.629
 it has a brightness 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.629
 quite 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.040
 I do not know if to say it artificial but good to 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.360
 me the truth that I really like the 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.030
 illuminators I like the illuminators 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.060
 marked powerful and I do not care that no 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.800
 be like an illuminator the one that comes out of 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.620
 the skin in the light so I do not care 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.990
 because I love the illuminator and 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.000
 I do not care if it's not natural like that 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.140
 that's good because I liked it a lot 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.390
 I had wanted the 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.790
 albatross because good is like a basic 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.290

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.290
