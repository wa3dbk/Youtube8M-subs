quest with 43 prayer although I did get
 a<00:00:41.820> bit<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> boss<00:00:42.870> fight<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
 a bit with the boss fight at the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.770 
 a bit with the boss fight at the
end<00:00:43.530> west<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.280> 16<00:00:44.789> times<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
end west by 16 times when I just need to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
end west by 16 times when I just need to
hit<00:00:46.020> once<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.219> fire<00:00:47.430> strike<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
hit once and that was with fire strike I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
hit once and that was with fire strike I
believe<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.899> should<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.320> definitely<00:00:49.469> hit

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
believe so I should have definitely hit

I've only ever had to amaze random

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
I've only ever had to amaze random
events<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> old<00:01:10.710> school<00:01:11.010> runescape<00:01:11.180> 2007

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
events in the old school runescape 2007

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
events in the old school runescape 2007
servers<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.290> far<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.130> pretty<00:01:14.280> epic

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
servers so far so that was pretty epic

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
servers so far so that was pretty epic
and<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.509> epic<00:01:15.810> rewards<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and I got some epic rewards from that so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
and I got some epic rewards from that so
I<00:01:16.799> thought<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.220> worth<00:01:17.400> uploading<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I thought it was worth uploading and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.249 
I thought it was worth uploading and
showing<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.420> guys<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> did<00:01:19.170> actually

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
showing you guys because I did actually

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
showing you guys because I did actually
make<00:01:19.650> probably<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:20.939> 100k<00:01:21.450> or
