00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.860 
medals these are white candy melts that
I'm<00:02:01.150> actually<00:02:01.360> dying<00:02:02.220> silver<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.460> bronze

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
I'm actually dying silver and bronze

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.220

using<00:02:05.280> paste<00:02:06.280> food<00:02:06.550> color<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:08.050> does

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
using paste food color and it does

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.260 
using paste food color and it does
thicken<00:02:08.680> up<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.100> candy<00:02:09.640> melts<00:02:09.760> a<00:02:09.910> little<00:02:09.940> bit

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
thicken up the candy melts a little bit

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.270 
thicken up the candy melts a little bit
but<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.020> actually<00:02:11.200> worked<00:02:11.560> quite<00:02:11.770> nicely<00:02:11.800> so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
but it actually worked quite nicely so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.950 
but it actually worked quite nicely so
if<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.460> have<00:02:12.640> white<00:02:12.940> candy<00:02:13.330> melts<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.750> can

if you have white candy melts you can

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.320

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
dye them using paste food color you

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.730 
dye them using paste food color you
can't<00:02:16.600> use<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.990> liquid<00:02:17.320> food<00:02:17.500> color

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
otherwise it'll go all clumped up so I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
lengths of it you could probably use

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.510 
lengths of it you could probably use
shoestring<00:02:59.380> licorice<00:02:59.440> as<00:03:00.010> well<00:03:00.310> for<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:05.520> and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
shoestring licorice as well for this and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.770 
shoestring licorice as well for this and
then<00:03:07.209> I'm<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.510> using<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.290> skewer<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.750> poke<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
then I'm just using a skewer to poke a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.220 
then I'm just using a skewer to poke a
hole<00:03:10.930> into<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.070> metal<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:13.989> able<00:03:14.080> to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
hole into the metal just to be able to

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.970 
hole into the metal just to be able to
insert<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.830> lanyard<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:17.440> doesn't<00:03:17.680> have<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.890> go

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
insert the lanyard it doesn't have to go

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.290 
insert the lanyard it doesn't have to go
all<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.190> way<00:03:18.340> through<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.790> needs<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.180> go

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
all the way through it just needs to go

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.460 
all the way through it just needs to go
in<00:03:19.480> because<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> other<00:03:19.959> piece<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.200> going<00:03:20.410> to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
in because the other piece is going to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.350 
in because the other piece is going to
go<00:03:20.620> underneath<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.489> cupcake<00:03:21.940> just

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360
