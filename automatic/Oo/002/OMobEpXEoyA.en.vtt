00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 use it in a variety of ways every year, of course, even though it is too late 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.749
 map the screen with it she has a very special place 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.059
 the term Noordhoek used is not clear again 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.690
 is happy that I always learned and tablet has no keyboard and an open book 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 hour on the keyboard 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.420
 so why is the emergency bell 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 well i actually know another could that the hardware it contains is relative 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.170
 is powerful in it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.839
 he cost when the Germans very cheap this is not the playful 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:02.520
 clearly 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.010
 yes it is a bit busy but there is one that is 54 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.890
 does not immediately say anything via his retirement in the 54 rounds but 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 the individual and that model is actually derived from the core i3 core 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.000
 i5 and core i7 processor allowing extra energy efficient version 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 and that on such a comma completed two titles from japan with less cash and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620
 then i mention you can make a panty between the bazaar was good at kees 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.710
 wessels has the hummingbird but he still drives some kind of cars 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.840
 energy efficient otherwise 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.969
 it is not really a runner but it does have the intel hd graphics and 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.469
 it's the only thing it's a full happy feet there's nothing loose in all 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.140
 that time the child to chorus the arm processor 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.060
 ugly mobile operating system ios and android this has a full psv 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.100
 with windows 7 jacobs and the only thing he doesn't have is a keyboard but 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.570
 there is special incurring here if you are busy there then where you will automatically get it 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.520
 then part of the household collapsed 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.100
 go to go tap the keyboard a funny thing is that the vomar if you t like 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 you can do them if you if you press something then you will notice that he 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 briefly and a little bit of cultivation as if the vibration of your phone knows when 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 have the idea that you really have a sign that third parties are using their cell phones 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.290
 Nowadays we also don't have to miss out 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.889
 with until the attack is now successful 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.569
 and of course you just windows 7 on the chicane actually do everything with it 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.309
 you can wait for a normal price and can and you do not have an automatic can 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.349
 just don't point to the screen that are 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.319
 is going 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 two that he knows well it's not very super accurate that they are on a bit 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.010
 too bad with having a while with 600 sitting there should be a really good way 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.849
 again certain of the small screen elements how i can touch it 4 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.650
 he it is kind of a wdv device and the limited trading time comes true 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.659
 what they will never put on the market 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.069
 and yet computer market at Zulu Waregem asus has motto is a requirement that is 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.689
 for example just show with being with being two screens it goes 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.930
 So here they might go what he is going to do with the city center of Utrecht 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.359
 is really for sale 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.989
 but which price was chosen at which time 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.459
 the role of who it is now the whole story lopik purpose this works 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.659
 but I do not know so handy if you are really on the borders they still have to be 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.329
 used to watch but for those two disks are very handy yes that 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.779
 that is always a bit limited with, for example, the device for an hour 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.339
 de and sank into the application that is a unique book an application is on 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.160
 installed 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.529
 and then you can do it yourself 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.249
 read a book well and then we say no book two pages next to each other 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.269
 yes i must honestly say i like things 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.589
 it is great fun but i'm going to send it home from publisher 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.179
 the advantage of those things is what you want us to say 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.270
 now out windows 7 in October 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.280
 and j can run real applications on it 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.259
 He will again form a team that makes it now he is not in the tracks 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.189
 audible 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.059
 it's a bit of products that I don't quite know what we do what 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.529
 we have to say it is nice to see that it is possible 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.240
 hey maybe not a new date in that regard 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.600
 I look at what we can make product and yes I think it is 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.400
 striking that they actually bring to market 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.079
 then we will look at how successful it is 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.419
 and with that the end of this episode of hart tv could be the next 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.290
