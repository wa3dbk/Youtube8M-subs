Torres<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.740> team<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.369> very<00:00:17.699> good<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.180> won

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
Torres and this team was very good I won

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
Torres and this team was very good I won
the<00:00:18.869> majority<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.380> games<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.070> team<00:00:20.310> but

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the majority of games with this team but

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
the majority of games with this team but
it<00:00:20.850> probably<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.480> quite<00:00:21.750> expensive<00:00:22.130> somewhere

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it probably is quite expensive somewhere

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.300 
it probably is quite expensive somewhere
between<00:00:23.310> 80<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> hundred<00:00:24.510> K<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
between 80 to a hundred K so there are a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
between 80 to a hundred K so there are a
few<00:00:26.640> players<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.150> could<00:00:27.359> substitute<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
few players you could substitute in and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439 
few players you could substitute in and
out<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.859> make<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> price<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.060> would
