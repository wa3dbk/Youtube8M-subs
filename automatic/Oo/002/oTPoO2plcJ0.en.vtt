create<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.640> item<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> system<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
create this item in the system and then

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.120 
create this item in the system and then
we<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.280> sell<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> item<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.860> reorder<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
we will sell the item and reorder it and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.980 
we will sell the item and reorder it and
run<00:01:50.430> some<00:01:50.610> reports<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.420> we'll<00:01:51.630> show<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
run some reports so we'll show you the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
run some reports so we'll show you the
basics<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> inventory<00:01:53.670> control<00:01:54.030> system

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
basics of the inventory control system

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
basics of the inventory control system
so<00:01:54.869> first<00:01:55.080> I'm<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.189> manager

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
so first I'm going to go to the manager

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 
so first I'm going to go to the manager
section<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> software<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
section of the software which is

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
section of the software which is
password-protected<00:01:58.740> by<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.400> way<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.850> we'll

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
password-protected by the way and we'll

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
password-protected by the way and we'll
go<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> inventory<00:02:01.079> maintenance<00:02:01.680> already

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
go to the inventory maintenance already

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.450 
go to the inventory maintenance already
have<00:02:02.369> queued<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.119> coca-cola<00:02:03.509> item<00:02:04.140> here

essentially all you would do is scan the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.830 
essentially all you would do is scan the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
barcode in as the SKU item number type

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
barcode in as the SKU item number type
in<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.110> description<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> item<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.880> can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
track the cost of goods sold or you can

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.130 
track the cost of goods sold or you can
leave<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.459> blank<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
leave that blank it's up to you and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
leave that blank it's up to you and
the<00:02:16.230> price<00:02:16.440> you're<00:02:16.680> selling<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:18.150> if

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the price you're selling it at and if

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.760 
the price you're selling it at and if
you<00:02:18.450> want<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> whole<00:02:19.080> nine<00:02:19.260> yards

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
you want to go the whole nine yards

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.370 
you want to go the whole nine yards
you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.040> also<00:02:20.280> set<00:02:20.760> up<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:21.330> ordering<00:02:21.900> info

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you can also set up your ordering info

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.490 
you can also set up your ordering info
so<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.069> can<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.520> reorder<00:02:24.150> points<00:02:24.569> well<00:02:25.200> which

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so you can do reorder points well which

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.400 
so you can do reorder points well which
means<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.160> say<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.200> thirty<00:02:28.200> five

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
means that say you have thirty five

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.710 
means that say you have thirty five
items<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.950> stock<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.150> always<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.660> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
items in stock but you always want to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.870 
items in stock but you always want to
have<00:02:30.870> 40<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.319> stock<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.010> 40<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.580> your<00:02:32.730> reorder

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
have 40 in stock so 40 is your reorder

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.910 
have 40 in stock so 40 is your reorder
point<00:02:33.330> once<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> gets<00:02:34.140> below<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.740> number

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
point once it gets below that number

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.770 
point once it gets below that number
it's<00:02:35.520> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> show<00:02:35.940> up<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.300> reorder

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's going to show up on a reorder

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.380 
it's going to show up on a reorder
report<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> on<00:02:37.620> purchase<00:02:37.830> orders<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.209> that's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
report and on purchase orders so that's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.060 
report and on purchase orders so that's
automatic<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.440> don't<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.890> look

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
automatic so you don't have to look

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190 
automatic so you don't have to look
through<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.490> entire<00:02:41.790> list<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.450> inventory<00:02:42.989> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
through an entire list of inventory to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.309 
through an entire list of inventory to
see<00:02:43.380> what's<00:02:43.620> low<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.100> stock<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.810> also<00:02:45.959> can

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
see what's low in stock so we also can

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.199 
see what's low in stock so we also can
put<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> number<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.220> case<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.060> can

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
put in the number in case so we can

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.910 
put in the number in case so we can
order<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.750> quantities<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.680> than

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
order it in quantities other than

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.370 
order it in quantities other than
singles<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.330> put<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> case<00:02:51.720> cost<00:02:52.050> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
singles we can put a case cost and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.530 
singles we can put a case cost and
vendor<00:02:52.830> information<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.520> there<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.180> once<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
vendor information in there so once the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.390 
vendor information in there so once the
items<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.080> system<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.680> ready<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.130> sell

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
items in the system it's ready to sell

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
items in the system it's ready to sell
so<00:02:57.120> I'm<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> exit<00:02:57.510> from<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.019> screen
