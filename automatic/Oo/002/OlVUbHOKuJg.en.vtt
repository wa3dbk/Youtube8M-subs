 two things to the fifa ultimate team so 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.680
 burn a little under the nails 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.360
 because I spend a lot of time with it 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.809
 and these are all these tips 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.269
 So you know how to draw 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.170
 week, these teams were on players too 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.699
 I have tons of cross in there 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.089

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.409
 then came on Sunday these hundred thousand 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.999
 Coins text I had to go first then 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.949
 I deduct three people so that I can 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.550
 with enough coins to pay for it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 to be able to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.809
 then I pull that and then it is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.580
 best player in there klose 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.560

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.080
 rea and bell and because that can 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 I will not be then I asked him 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 but my can deliver 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.200
 because I think it's incredibly worth it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.370
 and he just refused 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 and now wanted to ask if that's the case 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.380
 is unbalanced whether you maybe 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.240
 about their support, so to speak, simply 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:51.540
 one of the players on my account 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:02:14.400
 So they could transfer over 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:17.090

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.090
