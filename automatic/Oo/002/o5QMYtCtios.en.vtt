00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.330
 most tablets sim card 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.799
 used only two thousand connection but 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 and with smart phone 7 and you need urgently 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 call iconbit nettab matrix 3g duo 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 this problem disappears this compact 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.420
 7 inch tablet if necessary 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 perfectly cope with the function of the smartphone for 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.869
 due to the fact that the back panel will cause 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 embossed drawing keep tablet in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.829
 his hands are very comfortable he does not slip out 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.510
 rocker on the left side 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
 volume control and home button 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.309
 there is a micro usb port on top 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 switch on and headset jack on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 front side is located 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 front camera on the back of the main 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 camera with flash and raw speakers 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 usually in tablets of a slot for sim cards 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.340
 are on the side panels but here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 to install shooting you need to remove the back 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.390
 panel and not all but only the top 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.609
 the compartment below it has two slots 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.350
 for standard-sized sim cards and one 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.350
 for micro sd memory cards 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 although this device can call 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.010
 it must still be a compact category 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.040
 the tablet is therefore installed here 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 7 inch ips resolution display 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.880
 1024 by 600 pixels characteristics in 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.439
 good principle but small density 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 pixels low contrast 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.040
 obviously will not please fans to read with 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.930
 tablet want to watch movies on it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.729
 possible even in hd quality 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 Yes, and the speakers are quite loud, but 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 there is no auto brightness control therefore 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 will have to adjust the question manually 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 Is there anything to the sensor that does not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 always takes the first time 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.200
 touching or slides it is noticeable for example 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.520
 when extending the panel water machines 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.170
 the tablet has a built-in camera on 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.390
 good quality she unfortunately not 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.430
 differed bright day photo 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 it turns out nothing but in the twilight 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.450
 rooms of noise on the photo of portraits of impressions 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.479
 so rely on artistic 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.439
 pictures with this will be something I should not 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.360
 in fact the camera module is here 5 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.979
 megapixels but thanks to the software 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.409
 half hour interpolation 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.289
 8 megapixel photos 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.000
 This applies to video shooting in hd 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.100
 but in the properties of the received records we 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.539
 We see the resolution full hd and although with you 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340
 the video does not differ much 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.510
 clarity and image is obtained 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 pretty grainy 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.450
 the tablet runs on the operating system 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
 android 4 1 religion add-ons 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.110

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.630

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.590
 download everything you need from the play market 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.430

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.890
 interfaces 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.840
 from wireless wifi 3g and bluetooth 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.760
 cable can also be used if desired 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.540
 apple jack for connecting flash drives but also 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 the most important thing 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 smotritsky mind be able to rank and not 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.620
 by skype through usually mobility more 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.209
 additionally supported two sim cards in 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.920
 mode 27 to stand 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.690
 Of course it is convenient to call using 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.820
 headset but if the situation is quite 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.890
 hopelessly this can this tablet say 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.049
 Is that because of the size or you will 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.359
 good to hear the interlocutor or he you 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.989
 microphone speaker is located and far away 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.060
 profitable 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.950
 then switching sim cards is very convenient 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.930
 you can manually assign one of the cards 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.819
 active and on each time choose from 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.819
 which card will be called 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.900
 the tablet is installed dual-core 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.700

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.600
 a frequency of 1 2 gigahertz 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.310
 graphics accelerator powervr sgx531 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.930
 shoes quickly this model can not be called 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.450
 she fully justifies the title 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.720
 budget even navigating the menu sometimes 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.440
 slows down 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.150
 synthetic graphics tests we have 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.280
 for some reason they did not start but not 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.710
 worry real racing 3 and others 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:44.030
 modern games on the tablet go and this 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:46.340
 says one thing but what no complaints 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.720
 so and so the battery hours five or six 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.030
 maximum active work to you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:56.600
 provided that is quite at the level as 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.370
 tablet as a whole iconbit nettab matrix 3g 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.910

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.470
 device 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.540
 compact in size 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.310
 tablet and at the same time allowing you to call 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.560
 poor performance and camera 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.459
 testify not in favor important but not 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.920
 bad ergonomics 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.910
 capacious battery and affordable price will help 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.910
