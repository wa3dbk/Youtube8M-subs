00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
way around and you should also try and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.569 
way around and you should also try and
keep<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.599> zombie<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> end<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.160> each<00:00:32.309> round

preferably a walker because the crawlers

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
preferably a walker because the crawlers
tend<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> bleed<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.300> ok<00:00:36.780> step<00:00:37.050> 1<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.380> find

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
member needs to stand on the symbol at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
member needs to stand on the symbol at
the<00:00:45.149> same<00:00:45.660> time<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.200> activate<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.920> first

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the same time to activate this first

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
the same time to activate this first
step<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.270> yes<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.809> easter<00:00:49.200> egg<00:00:49.320> does<00:00:49.590> require

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
see here once it's activated it will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.599 
see here once it's activated it will
glow<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.829> some<00:00:59.039> dialogue<00:00:59.399> going

glow and you'll get some dialogue going
as<00:00:59.789> well<00:00:59.940> step<00:01:00.270> 2<00:01:00.510> find<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.289> same<00:01:01.649> symbols<00:01:02.250> but

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
as well step 2 find the same symbols but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
as well step 2 find the same symbols but
this<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> elevators<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this time not on the elevators there are

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.490 
this time not on the elevators there are
four<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.250> around<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> map<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.500> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
four of these around the map and you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.679 
four of these around the map and you
need<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.250> step<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
need to basically step on them in a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
need to basically step on them in a
certain<00:01:10.229> order<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.979> time<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.939> once

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
certain order this time not all at once

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.649 
certain order this time not all at once
so<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.320> changes<00:01:13.950> each<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.970> random<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
so it changes each time it is random you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
so it changes each time it is random you
just<00:01:16.049> need<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.560> trial<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> error<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.759> get

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
just need to do trial and error to get

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
just need to do trial and error to get
it<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:19.799> glow<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> once

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it right and then it will glow and once

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
it right and then it will glow and once
again<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.630> dialog<00:01:22.080> happening

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
again you get some dialog happening

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.359 
again you get some dialog happening
there<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> step<00:01:25.140> 2<00:01:25.470> once<00:01:26.040> you've<00:01:26.189> done

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
there so that is step 2 once you've done

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
there so that is step 2 once you've done
step<00:01:26.790> 2<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.689> need<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> sniper<00:01:28.530> rifle<00:01:28.799> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
step 2 you need to get a sniper rifle so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.789 
step 2 you need to get a sniper rifle so
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> sniper<00:01:30.630> rifle<00:01:30.960> off<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> wall

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you can get a sniper rifle off the wall

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
you can get a sniper rifle off the wall
down<00:01:32.100> towards<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> box<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
down towards where the box is where that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.679 
down towards where the box is where that
teddy<00:01:33.840> bear<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> SVU<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:36.659> a

will<00:01:48.149> teleport<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.820> Lions<00:01:51.329> pause<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
will teleport to the Lions pause in the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.499 
will teleport to the Lions pause in the
starting<00:01:53.040> area<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.850> once<00:01:54.180> you've<00:01:54.329> done

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
starting area here so once you've done

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.139 
starting area here so once you've done
that<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.290> step<00:01:55.530> three<00:01:55.860> done<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:57.000> at

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that and it's step three done now at

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
that and it's step three done now at
this<00:01:57.329> point<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> easter<00:01:58.259> egg<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.560> split

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this point the easter egg will split

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.969 
this point the easter egg will split
into<00:01:59.630> Richtofen<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.780> part<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> easter<00:02:01.860> egg

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
into Richtofen as part of the easter egg

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
into Richtofen as part of the easter egg
which<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
which is the one that we are doing and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.370 
which is the one that we are doing and
for<00:02:04.590> step<00:02:04.979> four<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.180> need<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.780> get

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
for step four what you need to do get

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.619 
for step four what you need to do get
the<00:02:07.530> slicker<00:02:07.799> fire<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> slicker<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the slicker fire and slicker by the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.040 
the slicker fire and slicker by the
balls<00:02:10.619> underneath<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.849> Lions<00:02:12.270> paws<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.840> just

balls underneath the Lions paws so just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.670 
balls underneath the Lions paws so just
keep<00:02:13.200> shooting

keep shooting

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
keep shooting
at<00:02:13.739> them<00:02:13.920> until<00:02:14.129> they<00:02:14.670> start<00:02:14.700> spinning<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.659> do

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
at them until they start spinning it do

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
at them until they start spinning it do
one<00:02:16.079> at<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.549> this<00:02:17.700> point<00:02:18.060> once<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
one at a time and at this point once you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
one at a time and at this point once you
start<00:02:18.689> doing<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.409> maxis<00:02:19.859> part<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.250> the

place trample stems down on these aiming
them<00:03:39.720> at<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.319> spire<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.459> they<00:03:41.579> will

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
them at the spire so that they will

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.729 
them at the spire so that they will
fling<00:03:42.030> zombies<00:03:42.509> towards<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.049> spire<00:03:43.349> for<00:03:43.650> the

you hear me placing a trample steam and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.349 
you hear me placing a trample steam and
then<00:03:49.319> we'll<00:03:49.500> show<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.680> us<00:03:50.040> flinging<00:03:51.000> some

then we'll show you us flinging some
zombies<00:03:51.750> with<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.530> trample<00:03:52.919> steams<00:03:53.129> towards

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
zombies with the trample steams towards

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.729 
zombies with the trample steams towards
the<00:03:53.639> spire<00:03:53.909> now<00:03:54.599> it<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.959> be<00:03:54.989> hard<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.470> get<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
the spire now it can be hard to get the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.009 
the spire now it can be hard to get the
aim<00:03:55.919> right<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.609> having<00:03:57.150> said<00:03:57.449> that<00:03:57.509> I'm<00:03:57.810> not<00:03:57.870> a

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
aim right but having said that I'm not a

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.629 
aim right but having said that I'm not a
hundred<00:03:58.259> percent<00:03:58.409> sure<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.189> need<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.459> be

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
hundred percent sure you need to be

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.780 
hundred percent sure you need to be
killing<00:04:00.150> zombies<00:04:01.549> necessarily<00:04:02.549> with<00:04:02.759> the

killing zombies necessarily with the
trample<00:04:03.269> stems<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.989> step<00:04:04.199> because<00:04:04.409> if

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
trample stems for this step because if

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.789 
trample stems for this step because if
you<00:04:05.489> watch<00:04:05.790> carefully<00:04:06.359> in<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.199> second<00:04:07.650> here

you watch carefully in a second here

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.059 
you watch carefully in a second here
you'll<00:04:08.009> see<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:08.579> get<00:04:08.729> our<00:04:08.879> final<00:04:10.069> zombie

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
you'll see that we get our final zombie

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.789 
you'll see that we get our final zombie
kill<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:12.239> by<00:04:12.419> shooting<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.019> zombie<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.560> it

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
pillars at the bottom of the spire now

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.430 
pillars at the bottom of the spire now
each<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.800> these<00:04:49.100> pillars<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:50.110> designated<00:04:51.110> with

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
each of these pillars is designated with

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.520 
each of these pillars is designated with
a<00:04:51.470> specific<00:04:51.970> direction<00:04:52.970> ie<00:04:53.240> north<00:04:53.690> east<00:04:54.080> south

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
a specific direction ie north east south

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.860 
a specific direction ie north east south
and<00:04:54.800> west<00:04:54.889> you<00:04:55.490> can<00:04:55.729> work<00:04:56.150> out<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.570> north

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and west you can work out the north

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.050 
and west you can work out the north
pillar<00:04:57.229> because<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.830> always<00:04:58.070> has<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.490> mahjong

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
pillar because it always has a mahjong

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.540 
pillar because it always has a mahjong
tiles<00:04:59.360> sitting<00:04:59.870> on<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.229> rail<00:05:00.440> in<00:05:01.039> front<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
tiles sitting on the rail in front of it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.670 
tiles sitting on the rail in front of it
now<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.509> is<00:05:02.599> what<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.840> mahjong<00:05:03.229> tiles<00:05:03.470> look

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
now this is what the mahjong tiles look

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.529 
now this is what the mahjong tiles look
like<00:05:03.889> these<00:05:04.099> mahjong<00:05:04.580> tiles<00:05:04.820> are<00:05:05.030> found<00:05:05.270> in

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
like these mahjong tiles are found in

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.120 
like these mahjong tiles are found in
random<00:05:05.930> locations<00:05:05.960> throughout<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.949> map

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
random locations throughout the map

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.010 
random locations throughout the map
you'll<00:05:07.340> need<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.699> find<00:05:07.970> them<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.330> work<00:05:08.509> out<00:05:08.720> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
you'll need to find them to work out the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.730 
you'll need to find them to work out the
specific<00:05:09.590> order<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.310> galvanic<00:05:10.639> all<00:05:11.000> the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
specific order to galvanic all the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.830 
specific order to galvanic all the
pillars<00:05:12.740> in<00:05:12.919> so<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.550> need<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.150> recognize<00:05:14.630> what

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
pillars in so you need to recognize what

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.330 
pillars in so you need to recognize what
these<00:05:15.050> symbols<00:05:15.289> look<00:05:15.620> like<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.070> what<00:05:16.190> they

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
these symbols look like and what they

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.879 
these symbols look like and what they
mean<00:05:16.580> here<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.150> have<00:05:17.180> east<00:05:17.630> north<00:05:18.110> south<00:05:18.620> and

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
mean here we have east north south and

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.310 
mean here we have east north south and
west<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.669> four<00:05:19.880> winds<00:05:20.150> indicate<00:05:21.110> the

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
west the four winds indicate the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.850 
west the four winds indicate the
direction<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:22.300> all<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.570> pillar<00:05:24.199> that<00:05:24.710> you

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
direction of all the pillar that you

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.800 
direction of all the pillar that you
need<00:05:25.039> to<00:05:25.160> hit<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:25.699> next<00:05:25.940> we<00:05:26.120> need<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.449> know<00:05:26.570> the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
need to hit so next we need to know the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.839 
need to hit so next we need to know the
sequence<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.530> hit<00:05:27.710> them<00:05:27.889> in<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.280> these<00:05:28.490> are

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
sequence to hit them in and these are

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.029 
sequence to hit them in and these are
indicated<00:05:29.449> by<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.720> mahjong<00:05:30.229> tiles<00:05:30.470> with<00:05:30.800> the

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
indicated by the mahjong tiles with the

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.430 
indicated by the mahjong tiles with the
tally<00:05:31.490> marks<00:05:31.849> these<00:05:31.970> of<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.240> bamboos<00:05:32.750> the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
tally marks these of the bamboos the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.950 
tally marks these of the bamboos the
first<00:05:33.740> one<00:05:33.979> keep<00:05:34.250> in<00:05:34.400> mind<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.909> bird<00:05:35.300> pitcher

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
first one keep in mind is a bird pitcher

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.899 
first one keep in mind is a bird pitcher
the<00:05:36.169> rest<00:05:36.380> are<00:05:36.620> just<00:05:36.650> simple<00:05:37.280> two<00:05:37.550> three<00:05:37.849> and

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
the rest are just simple two three and

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.240 
the rest are just simple two three and
four<00:05:38.120> tally<00:05:38.449> marks<00:05:38.870> so<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.770> need<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.130> go

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
four tally marks so you need to go

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.649 
four tally marks so you need to go
throughout<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.610> map<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:41.000> find<00:05:41.300> these<00:05:41.449> these

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
throughout the map and find these these

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.659 
throughout the map and find these these
will<00:05:41.840> be<00:05:41.930> in<00:05:42.020> random<00:05:42.349> locations<00:05:42.919> each<00:05:43.220> time

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
will be in random locations each time

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.719 
will be in random locations each time
and<00:05:43.970> they<00:05:44.510> will<00:05:44.720> basically<00:05:45.470> have<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.130> certain

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
and they will basically have a certain

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.640 
and they will basically have a certain
color<00:05:47.000> that<00:05:47.419> corresponds<00:05:48.199> with<00:05:48.229> the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
color that corresponds with the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.980 
color that corresponds with the
direction<00:05:49.310> color<00:05:49.820> so<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.479> that<00:05:50.720> say

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
direction color so you know that say

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.320

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
blue we had north so we hit that fourth

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.580 
blue we had north so we hit that fourth
or<00:06:21.680> last<00:06:22.099> in<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.550> sequence<00:06:23.030> then<00:06:24.020> down<00:06:24.289> here

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
remember we had the red number one so

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.110 
remember we had the red number one so
the<00:06:47.900> South<00:06:48.169> pillar<00:06:48.500> is<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.680> one<00:06:48.919> we<00:06:49.069> hit<00:06:49.250> first

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
the South pillar is the one we hit first

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.689 
the South pillar is the one we hit first
okay<00:06:51.050> this<00:06:51.229> was<00:06:51.379> the<00:06:51.530> last<00:06:51.710> of<00:06:52.039> the<00:06:52.129> six<00:06:52.370> tiles

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
okay this was the last of the six tiles

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.309 
okay this was the last of the six tiles
that<00:06:52.939> we<00:06:53.090> needed<00:06:53.300> to<00:06:53.419> work<00:06:53.659> out<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.020> order

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
that we needed to work out the order

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.230 
that we needed to work out the order
this<00:06:54.469> was<00:06:54.680> Green<00:06:54.979> three<00:06:55.639> so<00:06:55.909> we<00:06:56.060> knew<00:06:56.210> that

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
this was Green three so we knew that

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.770 
this was Green three so we knew that
South<00:06:56.659> was<00:06:56.900> first<00:06:57.199> as<00:06:57.439> I<00:06:57.560> said<00:06:57.770> before<00:06:58.419> West<00:06:59.419> is

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
South was first as I said before West is

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.619 
South was first as I said before West is
the<00:07:00.139> third<00:07:00.469> and<00:07:00.860> North<00:07:01.490> is<00:07:01.729> the<00:07:01.939> fourth<00:07:02.270> which

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:02.629 
the third and North is the fourth which

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.200 
the third and North is the fourth which
left<00:07:02.990> of<00:07:03.349> course<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:04.219> East<00:07:04.460> one<00:07:04.789> as<00:07:05.060> the

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
left of course the East one as the

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.959 
left of course the East one as the
second<00:07:05.629> one<00:07:05.750> that<00:07:05.780> we<00:07:06.050> hit<00:07:06.259> I<00:07:06.669> hope<00:07:07.669> that's<00:07:07.879> not

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969 
second one that we hit I hope that's not

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.999 
second one that we hit I hope that's not
too<00:07:08.270> confusing<00:07:08.750> for<00:07:08.900> you<00:07:09.139> guys<00:07:09.319> but<00:07:09.560> basically

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
just as I said needs to match up the

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.110 
just as I said needs to match up the
direction<00:07:12.319> with<00:07:13.009> the<00:07:13.219> number<00:07:13.610> and<00:07:13.639> the<00:07:13.940> number

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120
