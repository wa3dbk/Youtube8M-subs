00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.249
Auctioneer: We have a black, bantam coaching
hen………

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:08.630
Kelly Mc: There might be nothing that speaks
to free market capitalism like Mechelle Watson’s

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.920
booming business in Wilson’s Mills, North
Carolina.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.620
Mechelle Watson - Auction - My son and I were
brainstorming one day and my son looked at

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.860
me and said, “Mama, let’s open a chicken
auction.”

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.770
Kelly Mc: Mechelle owns and operates the Wicked
Chicken Auction.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.260
It’s one place, you can buy, sell, maybe
trade and certainly hang out among the birds,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.120
the rabbit, the goat and the Regulars who
stock their flocks with Wicked Chicken buys.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.230
Ricky Belcher - There’s always variety uphere.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.370
There’s a little bit of everything.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.600
There’s always a bunch of stuff.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600
A good auctioneer.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.940
Good people and I enjoy it.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.640
We just come up here and have a good time.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.059
Buy a few chickens and go on back home.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.519
Mechelle Watson - You get so many different
people in here.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.519
I mean everything.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.140
The hobby farmers, serious farmers, you get
the serious breeders that you’ll see a state

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.499
fair showing and here we are.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.809
Kelly Mc: Cindy O’Neal’s at The Wicked
Chicken for a couple of hens.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.000
Kelly Mc: How much money do you need to bring
to the auction?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
Cindy O’Neal: Well, right now in my pocket
I’ve only got fifteen bucks.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.050
So, that’s my limit today.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.860
Kelly Mc: And how far will fifteen dollars
go at the average auction?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.350
Cindy O’Neal: Not very far.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.350
{laughs}

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.810
Kelly Mc: The Wicked Chicken’s Sunday afternoon
auctions seem to bring every one of every

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.320
age from every place imaginable.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.540
Steve Novakovich visits a twice a year.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090
Kelly Mc: What am I getting into?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.280
Steve Novakovich : Well, a lot.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.560
It’s quick.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.660
It’s fast; just a lot of birds.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.610
Kelly Mc: The auction rules are simple.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.460
Get there early and scout the birds you might
want to buy.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.530
You’ll find an occasional rabbit or goat
that will be auctioned as well.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.030
Some buyers take written notes and wait for
the lot they wish to bid on but experienced

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.990
buyers, like Asheboro’s Ricky Belcher, they
know what they want when they see it.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.050
Ricky Belcher: If they’re old, I don’t
need them.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.050
Nobody wants to eat them.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.500
Kelly Mc: How can you tell an old chicken
from a young one other than size?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.890
Ricky Belcher: Just look it.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.010
You can see it.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.960
You know, an old rooster, he’s old.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.590
He’s got big spurs and big cone.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.590
You can look at them and see.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.540
Kelly Mc: Is it right that somebody would
try to push an old rooster off on an auction

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.620
or should you not do that?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.410
Ricky: There’s some people, if you’re
going to breed them and keep them, to raise

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.030
from, you need an older rooster.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.030
He’s better.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.980
Kelly Mc: More mature and settled.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.980
Ricky: That’s right.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.980
Like me.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.109
Kelly Mc: This is pretty cool.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.370
Robert Jones: You never know what’s in the
next box.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.450
You can find some of everything - young, worn
out - just pick out what you want and go get

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.450
it.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.189
Kelly Mc: Mechelle says when she opens that
gate every Sunday afternoon at 1pm, the buyers

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.889
are lined up to check out the merchandise.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.690
Kelly Mc: They’ve got the notes.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.719
They’ve got their money.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.219
Mechelle Watson: This is serious business
now.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.209
They’re serious about their poultry and
what they want to buy or sell or.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.580
Yeah, this is a serious industry.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.170
People really like knowing they raised it
in their very own back yard.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.189
Kelly Mc: Direct from the chicken to your
plate.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.529
Mechelle Watson: That’s right.

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.529
That’s right.

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:01.870
Cut the Middle Man out.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.209
Auctioneer: “Five dollar bill…….”

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.519
Kelly Mc: The auction team can sell a crate
of birds every 45 seconds all afternoon

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.540
Auctioneer “You bought it.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.540
50-cents.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.540
You’re number 876.”

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.719
Blake Phillips - It gets pretty hectic.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.629
I’m usually on the front holding animals
up and stuff.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.989
We go through about 100 to 115 boxes an hour.

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.519
So, we move pretty good.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.290
Mechelle: When my auctioneer gets cranked
up, you’re going to understand that.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.450
Auctioneer: “We have two hens.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.760
There’s one black Americana hen and……

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.120
Will Jenkins/Auctioneer: I try to read the
crowd a little bit the best I can but I try

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
to keep it moving.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.769
If they want in, they’ll put their hand
in the air but there’s no time to waste

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.060
that’s all I’ve got to say.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.079
Kelly Mc: The Wicked Chicken needs the speed
because it can sell four HUNDRED crates of

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.819
poultry and other birds in a single afternoon
auction.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.029
Will Jenkins - Sell or Trade - We have people
come from all over, just everybody - big families

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.139
come out - fun place to go on Sundays, Man.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.549
Buy, sell, trade - you name it.

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.440
Kelly Mc: It’s reached a point where The
Wicked Chicken Auction will spread its wings

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.209
into the weeknight to accommodate a growing
market for backyard chicken and poultry.
