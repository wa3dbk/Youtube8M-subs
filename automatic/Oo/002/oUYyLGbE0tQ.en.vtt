protector<00:01:27.509> by<00:01:28.080> sliding<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.890> can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
protector by sliding here you can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
protector by sliding here you can
usually<00:01:29.329> close<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> open<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.420> it's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
usually close it and open it and so it's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
usually close it and open it and so it's
totally<00:01:33.780> resistant<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> socks<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.790> vibrations

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
totally resistant to socks or vibrations

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.280 
totally resistant to socks or vibrations
or<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.680> easily<00:01:37.799> sit<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.290> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
or even it can easily sit here and it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.030 
or even it can easily sit here and it
won't<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:42.060> totally<00:01:42.329> resistant<00:01:43.049> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
won't do think it's totally resistant so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.160 
won't do think it's totally resistant so
I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:44.850> good<00:01:44.939> case<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.630> resists

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
I think it's a very good case it resists

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.760 
I think it's a very good case it resists
on<00:01:46.380> everything<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:48.200> I've<00:01:49.200> dropped<00:01:49.470> their
