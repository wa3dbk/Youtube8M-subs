00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.020
 good sir here he says to the lord what 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.290
 I know by the Chinese says in a drawer of 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.390
 8 but he had a problem that was a 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.210
 problem that did not bring me 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.679
 feeders ok here we made the case I'm not going 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.550
 to teach others for after 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:23.019
 show them how to discover I could solve 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.030
 the problem ok brought me these feeders 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 that are Spanish is not double 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.570
 he did not say anything to me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.910
 this piece has been for out the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.329
 problem that there was was this 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.420
 the drawers this you put it here you will 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.660
 they put a piece here creates it between the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 problem was that it does not enter between 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.800
 here but do not enter here do not go with the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.490
 tube was not allowed to pass here enters 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.860
 but there not 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.430
 it's done we were finding out we were 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.430
 looking 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.920
 and I told him not to worry about me 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.380
 was going to solve the problem did not call in 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.909
 I told him for a while that he had solved her 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.700
 problem 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.890
 we invented what is this piece 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.130
 here they see it in front and they think it 's 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 straight is not straight 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.470
 and inclined to go in the other 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 in the other 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.330
 tells you those hours for the reason for 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.330
 that I entered and put it not see 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.009
 here is going to be 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.490
 look at the atrocious fence and stayed there 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.610
 complete 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.260
 to avoid 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.050
 clothes shoes will look bad 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.090
 or chop the tube x reason why things 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.090
 we invented that is the lord 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.350
 has his other drawer is the only one that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.159
 missing in this long 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 I wanted to show him thinking and having 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.689
 interest in things 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.899
 you can do a lot and a lot 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.929
 We made many many arrangements 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.209
 just have patience in things 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.109
 it's a detail that he did not realize 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.180
 that motive and customers are always 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.670
 it comes to them to solve their problems 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.530
 even if it's not their fault 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 for not bringing the feeder 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 but Mr. Bedoya was resolved 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 by removing the piece if it is 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.890
 I liked that I was very happy with 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.990
 this piece tomorrow you will see the next video 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 when the gentleman comes to look for it 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.680
 the chinese lord 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.739

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.510
 I'm also going to put some videos of 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.470
 lugo runs over there because they charge 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 and I made a video to run 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.750
 and speaking that tells me in my new 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.550
 no longer workshop is not yet 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.420
