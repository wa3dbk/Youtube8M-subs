that's<00:02:49.750> kind<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.320> huge<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:50.950> previously

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that's kind of huge because previously

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.060 
that's kind of huge because previously
you<00:02:51.700> had<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.940> use<00:02:52.090> your<00:02:52.239> HDTVs<00:02:52.900> probably<00:02:53.860> not

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
you had to use your HDTVs probably not

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
you had to use your HDTVs probably not
great<00:02:54.310> analog<00:02:54.850> video<00:02:55.000> inputs<00:02:55.510> or<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:56.440> my<00:02:56.560> case

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
great analog video inputs or in my case

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.259 
great analog video inputs or in my case
I<00:02:56.980> used<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.280> little<00:02:57.489> box<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.820> converted

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
I used a little box that converted

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.420 
I used a little box that converted
analog<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.959> hdmi<00:02:59.440> but<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.980> still<00:03:00.160> had<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> use

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
analog to hdmi but you still had to use

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.250 
analog to hdmi but you still had to use
analog<00:03:00.760> connection<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.660> does<00:03:01.840> all<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.050> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
analog connection this does all of it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830 
analog connection this does all of it
inside<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.819> can<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.150> use<00:03:04.269> an<00:03:04.450> hdmi<00:03:04.810> cable

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
inside so you can just use an hdmi cable

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.800 
inside so you can just use an hdmi cable
and<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:06.489> makes<00:03:06.730> games<00:03:06.940> look<00:03:07.060> super<00:03:07.390> crisp<00:03:07.660> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and it makes games look super crisp and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.699 
and it makes games look super crisp and
you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.019> even<00:03:08.110> switch<00:03:08.380> between<00:03:08.560> different
