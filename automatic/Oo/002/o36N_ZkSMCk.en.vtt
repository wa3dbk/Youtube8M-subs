little things like that and it fits in
just<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.060> made<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> box<00:02:22.599> out<00:02:22.840> of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
just like so I made the box out of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.559 
just like so I made the box out of
cherry<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.590> used<00:02:24.040> finger<00:02:24.640> joints<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.239> hold<00:02:25.420> it

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
cherry and used finger joints to hold it

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.460 
through the jig I'll take the edge to
one<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.910> my<00:04:18.090> boards<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.110> butt

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
one of my boards and I'm going to butt

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.009 
one of my boards and I'm going to butt
it<00:04:19.620> up<00:04:19.739> right<00:04:20.190> next<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> pit<00:04:21.510> I'm<00:04:21.810> just

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
it up right next to that pit I'm just

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.720 
it up right next to that pit I'm just
going<00:04:22.170> to<00:04:22.200> hold<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.770> there<00:04:23.010> tightly<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
going to hold this on there tightly and

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.880 
going to hold this on there tightly and
run<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.660> through<00:04:27.200> now<00:04:28.200> I'll<00:04:28.380> move<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.680> over

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
run it through now I'll move it over

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:48.960 
run it through now I'll move it over
that<00:04:29.250> pin<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:29.910> keep<00:04:30.600> going<00:04:30.810> all<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.140> way

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.400 

when<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.060> get<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.450> end<00:04:50.660> then<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.110> want<00:04:51.380> to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
when you get to the end then you want to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.830 
when you get to the end then you want to
grab<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:52.220> board<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.850> is<00:04:52.970> going<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.330> join<00:04:53.570> up

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
grab the board that is going to join up

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.680 
grab the board that is going to join up
with<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.380> one<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.919> you'll<00:04:55.760> put<00:04:56.450> it<00:04:56.600> up

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
with that one and you'll put it up

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.110 
with that one and you'll put it up
against<00:04:57.110> this<00:04:57.290> one<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.740> run<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.010> through<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
against this one and run it through the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.150 
against this one and run it through the
way<00:04:59.270> I've<00:04:59.480> worked<00:04:59.750> out<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.930> mind<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.950> just

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
way I've worked out the mind is it just

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.129 
way I've worked out the mind is it just
butts<00:05:01.370> up<00:05:01.580> against<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.120> pin<00:05:02.510> depending<00:05:03.020> on

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
butts up against that pin depending on

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.020 
butts up against that pin depending on
how<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.380> have<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.650> set<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.400> may<00:05:04.610> need<00:05:04.850> to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
how you have it set you may need to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.060 
how you have it set you may need to
press<00:05:05.450> it<00:05:05.630> right<00:05:05.840> up<00:05:06.050> against<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.560> board<00:05:06.860> if

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
press it right up against the board if

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:23.680 
press it right up against the board if
it<00:05:07.250> overhangs<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:08.060> little<00:05:08.330> bit

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.930 

and<00:05:24.690> these<00:05:25.139> should<00:05:25.410> make<00:05:25.949> together<00:05:26.220> about

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
and these should make together about

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.999 
and these should make together about
like<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.289> know<00:05:28.410> of<00:05:28.620> course<00:05:28.680> you

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
like that and you know of course you

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.860 
like that and you know of course you
wouldn't<00:05:29.280> run<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> few<00:05:29.759> tests<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.449> you<00:05:30.750> know

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
wouldn't run a few tests and you know

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.059 
wouldn't run a few tests and you know
tweak<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.319> a<00:05:31.349> little<00:05:31.379> bit<00:05:31.680> before<00:05:31.830> you

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
tweak it a little bit before you

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.119 
tweak it a little bit before you
actually<00:05:32.550> run<00:05:32.849> it<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.210> mine's<00:05:34.020> not<00:05:34.440> too<00:05:34.800> bad

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
actually run it and mine's not too bad

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.760 
actually run it and mine's not too bad
I'm<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.400> little<00:05:35.639> butt<00:05:35.789> off<00:05:35.819> here<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:36.720> but<00:05:37.080> it's

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
I'm a little butt off here and but it's

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.740 
I'm a little butt off here and but it's
good<00:05:37.889> enough<00:05:38.039> for<00:05:38.159> me<00:05:38.310> it's<00:05:39.240> all<00:05:39.419> holding

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
good enough for me it's all holding

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.180 
good enough for me it's all holding
together<00:05:39.900> pretty<00:05:40.379> well<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.590> haven't<00:05:40.830> glued<00:05:40.979> it

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
together pretty well I haven't glued it

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.249 
together pretty well I haven't glued it
up<00:05:41.340> yet<00:05:41.580> because<00:05:41.849> now<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.330> got<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:42.870> work<00:05:42.990> out<00:05:43.110> all

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
up yet because now I got to work out all

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.230 
up yet because now I got to work out all
the<00:05:43.409> insides<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.069> all<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.340> fiddly<00:05:44.940> little

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
the insides and all the fiddly little

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.969 
the insides and all the fiddly little
bits<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.780> really<00:05:46.169> what<00:05:46.319> that<00:05:46.349> means<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.800> just

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
bits and really what that means is just

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.830 
bits and really what that means is just
cutting<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.310> whole<00:05:47.490> bunch<00:05:47.669> of<00:05:47.819> grooves<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.509> the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
cutting a whole bunch of grooves in the

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.300 
cutting a whole bunch of grooves in the
box<00:05:49.080> where<00:05:49.620> I<00:05:49.650> can<00:05:49.889> put<00:05:50.099> dividers<00:05:50.759> in<00:05:53.690> and<00:05:55.310> all

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
box where I can put dividers in and all

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.399 
box where I can put dividers in and all
of<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.520> day<00:05:56.699> tows<00:05:56.909> for<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.599> dividers<00:05:58.169> are

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
of the day tows for the dividers are

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.640 
of the day tows for the dividers are
thinner<00:05:59.039> than<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.490> used<00:05:59.970> for<00:06:00.449> the<00:06:00.870> joints<00:06:01.500> and

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
thinner than I used for the joints and

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.830 
thinner than I used for the joints and
they're<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.550> real<00:06:02.759> shallow<00:06:03.120> just<00:06:03.449> enough<00:06:03.690> to

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
they're just real shallow just enough to

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.260 
they're just real shallow just enough to
align<00:06:04.110> those<00:06:04.560> dividers<00:06:07.159> on<00:06:08.159> one<00:06:08.789> of<00:06:08.880> those<00:06:09.000> in

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
align those dividers on one of those in

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.850 
align those dividers on one of those in
pieces<00:06:09.750> I'm<00:06:09.930> going<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.169> cut<00:06:10.470> out<00:06:10.620> this

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
pieces I'm going to cut out this

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.490 
pieces I'm going to cut out this
rectangle<00:06:11.580> on<00:06:11.639> my<00:06:11.759> bandsaw<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.259> I<00:06:13.289> can

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
rectangle on my bandsaw so that I can

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.100 
rectangle on my bandsaw so that I can
get<00:06:13.650> nice<00:06:13.919> square<00:06:14.490> edges<00:06:14.729> on<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.360> ends<00:06:15.810> this

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
get nice square edges on the ends this

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:27.310 
get nice square edges on the ends this
is<00:06:16.289> going<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.590> be<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:17.069> drawer

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
with that same dado stack in my saw I'm

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.740 
with that same dado stack in my saw I'm
going<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.560> cut<00:06:31.949> rabbits<00:06:32.520> along<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:33.030> edges<00:06:33.600> of

I've got the box turned upside down and

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.129 
I've got the box turned upside down and
I've<00:06:46.760> cut<00:06:46.970> out<00:06:47.090> a<00:06:47.120> sheet<00:06:47.449> of<00:06:47.630> eighth<00:06:47.870> inch

I've cut out a sheet of eighth inch

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.000 
I've cut out a sheet of eighth inch
plywood<00:06:48.530> used<00:06:49.100> for<00:06:49.310> the<00:06:49.430> bottom<00:06:49.850> so<00:06:50.479> as<00:06:51.010> long

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
plywood used for the bottom so as long

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.730 
plywood used for the bottom so as long
as<00:06:52.190> this<00:06:52.340> fits<00:06:52.760> and<00:06:53.210> it<00:06:53.449> does<00:06:53.780> I<00:06:54.169> can<00:06:54.530> go<00:06:54.620> ahead

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
as this fits and it does I can go ahead
