00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 announced info video then I want 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 also start directly with the voices for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 the respective films were available for selection 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 the film the mystery of the towers and the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 coming horrorfilm of which I the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.759
 title but not yet betrayed 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.350
 Who wants to know more about this survey 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 should just do it again the info 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.250
 Watch video from about a week ago 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
 the whole thing is pretty pathetic 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 failed has come relatively many 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.849
 comments if you think so 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 knownness are almost 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 All comments little it thematically 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 Although there were many applications, it did 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 good as you wrote which one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 he wants to see both films for now 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.559
 Furthermore, there were significant 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 comments such as paraffin 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.840
 exclamation mark or even that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.969
 mystery of the towers is cool from which one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 then could not see exactly if the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.010
 respective author of the comment his 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 commentary as a vote 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.980
 if we have anyone here 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.840
 have omitted something or something 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 please leave us something similar 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 have a polite comment as well 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 we agree with skype 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.850
 have not been sent 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 otherwise too much work has been done 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
 that would be readable 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 but now we finally arrive too 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.290
 point three people voted in favor 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 that the current movie is the secret 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 first of all with many details 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 should be decorated and that we 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 also much will be turned on and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 nice to put a lot of energy in there 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.840
 and one has voted that the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.799
 horrorfilm quasi the current movie 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 should replace 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.820
 it was already announced that the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 very much someone failed 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.790
 but if I sound that way now 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.770
 it just pathetic 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.119
 That's why I want to ask you for that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 the coming surveys more 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.380
 Subject-related comments sent 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.210
 now become the topic that you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 probably much more interested 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.479
 So a boring schwafel the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.820
 applications 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.490
 yes I'll just read the names 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.020
 People do not care if they are 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.430
 for the build or directly for that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.229
 actor have applied 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.759
 like i said if i have someone 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.979
 forgot it writes in the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.290
 Comments 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.920
 I realized the following application 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.099
 like meyer lpc 987 super toxic boom yoko 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.860

 hamster at lpg profi faction wobbles 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.120
 linus groups exo nc marmelade 300 yes 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.710
 if someday it will be wrong 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 then I'm sorry 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.130
 but I can not do that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.760
 take care 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.130
 of course I can not just now 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.450
 whoever participates and who does not and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.520
 That's why we have to, of course 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.320
 to test how the actors want it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 sound and generally in the video 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.220
 work well then what that actually synonymous 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.260
 Again, I hope you have too 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.300
 like this video you are satisfied 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 and yes, who does not join me yet 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.020
 Skype then should me of course 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.800
 Add it all goes a lot 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.000
 easy to compete test et cetera pp 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.720
 and then I would say pure people 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.720
 Until next time
