00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
oh there you go see that got them all my

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.460 
oh there you go see that got them all my
information<00:01:55.670> look<00:01:55.820> at<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.110> how<00:01:57.110> cool<00:01:57.380> is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
information look at that how cool is

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.700 
information look at that how cool is
that<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.100> think<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.270> app<00:02:00.020> has<00:02:00.290> actually

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
that right I think this app has actually

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.420 
that right I think this app has actually
a<00:02:00.740> bug<00:02:00.980> in<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:05.230> know<00:02:06.230> so<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:07.130> got<00:02:07.160> all

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
a bug in it so you know so we got all

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.740 
a bug in it so you know so we got all
this<00:02:07.580> information<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.390> put<00:02:08.600> on<00:02:08.810> my<00:02:09.040> my<00:02:10.040> um<00:02:10.280> my<00:02:10.750> QR

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
this information I put on my my um my QR

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.720 
this information I put on my my um my QR
code<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.230> has<00:02:12.380> all<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.280> know<00:02:13.370> personal

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
code it has all my you know personal

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.970 
code it has all my you know personal
contact<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.570> all<00:02:14.780> my<00:02:14.930> website<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.709> can<00:02:15.830> put
