key<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.340> operation<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> one

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
key in this operation because it's one

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
key in this operation because it's one
of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> landmarks<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.100> fast<00:01:29.909> travel<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of the landmarks you can fast travel to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.200 
of the landmarks you can fast travel to
and<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.960> couldn't<00:01:31.200> fast<00:01:31.409> travel<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:33.030> not

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and if you couldn't fast travel it's not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.700 
and if you couldn't fast travel it's not

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
because when you're full and you can't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360 
because when you're full and you can't
carry<00:02:12.780> anymore<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.800> want<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.220> your

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
carry anymore you want to go on your

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.860 
carry anymore you want to go on your
horse<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.670> fast<00:02:14.910> travel<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.600> can't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
horse a fast travel because you can't

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.160 
horse a fast travel because you can't
when<00:02:16.050> you're<00:02:16.610> don't<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.730> enough<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:19.020> have

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
when you're don't have enough or have

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.710 
when you're don't have enough or have
too<00:02:19.320> much<00:02:19.410> weight<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> make<00:02:21.690> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
too much weight on you so I make a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.810 
too much weight on you so I make a
mistake<00:02:21.900> right<00:02:22.320> here<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> don't<00:02:22.620> take<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.370> bone

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
mistake right here I don't take the bone

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.180 
mistake right here I don't take the bone
meal<00:02:24.060> first<00:02:24.330> which<00:02:24.780> makes<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.620> lot<00:02:25.740> harder<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
meal first which makes a lot harder so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490 
meal first which makes a lot harder so
just<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.610> bone<00:02:26.790> meal<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.140> then<00:02:28.140> hit<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
just take the bone meal and then hit it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.940 
just take the bone meal and then hit it
and<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.130> also<00:02:29.510> hit<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> skeleton

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and you can also hit a on the skeleton

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.370 
and you can also hit a on the skeleton
and<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.670> V<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> B<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.540> stacks<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and be a V a B and it stacks up we like

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.220 
and be a V a B and it stacks up we like
four<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.800> five<00:02:35.150> six<00:02:36.150> seven<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> take<00:02:37.110> them

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
four or five six seven and you take them

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.590 
four or five six seven and you take them
like<00:02:37.410> thirty<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:37.980> once<00:02:38.330> which<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.450> actually

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
like thirty at once which I actually

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
like thirty at once which I actually
prefer<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.280> seems<00:02:41.489> a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
prefer that way because it just seems a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.070 
prefer that way because it just seems a
little<00:02:41.610> faster<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.630> you're<00:02:42.720> gonna<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:42.959> back

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
little faster so you're gonna get back

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.060 
little faster so you're gonna get back
on<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.290> horse<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.070> back<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.640> white<00:02:45.540> run

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
on your horse and go back to white run

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.800
