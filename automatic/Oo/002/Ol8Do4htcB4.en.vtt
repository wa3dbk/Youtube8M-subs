 something 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.469
 a theme 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469
 since the beginning of the triduum that is 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.739
 we are already fed up 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.939
 behind the 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.939
 if they tell us the truth 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.349
 do not 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.349
 lionel messi 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 good question 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.729
 It has also been good enough 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.480
 funny 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.800
 sell an interesting experience 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.389
 I'm sorry to have three is one of the 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.039
 of the sites 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.139
 that he remembered is from agents of many years of watching him on TV 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.319
 Iberia is very excited to play some in three hits 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 and that it was possible if they want to do it 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.539
 not experienced at the moment 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.520
 Well, he was born and grew 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.789
 quite curious because we had never recorded just beginning of 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.949
 behaviors like kitchens 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.979
 controls are poblanos 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.199
 we recorded a college 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.979
 peron names and logos more for 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.210
 something similar that was with cameras makes you feel very curious has people 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.110
 for the environment 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.229
 I notice more afternoons for TV 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.860
 I think very conscious until then you see yourself and sometimes you feel ridiculous 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.370
 with the respect but 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.770
 it goes out then it says 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.559
 the truth is that this morning he spoke 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:27.569
 When is 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.379
 we know that this time under the concept of radio 3 he composed it 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.469
 Realistically, he remembered the first live concert 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.860
 back the TV that I stayed to see it because I love and afternoons 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.069
 where you have to wait 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.659
 i 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.629
 and they have given it to me and it has to go I hsprd present emphasized a little strange that 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.509
 sixteen years later like this 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.839
 twelve years later 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.419
 3 We are the ones who 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.789
 we have endorsement concert and it has been 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.960
 Well, a little strange because I never 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.300
 I played TV 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300
 and it's weird is not a concert of groups of the cup conceto caries 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.830
 lizards of the 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.800
 pm 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.210
 and the good audience that's like 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.800
 cooler is spence another way but it has its roll and its voice when it 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.650
 let's see in 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.270
 josé m nate leyva normally trees 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.110
 by staying behind Libya he thinks he's pretty good 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.110
 and a little more 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.110
 I left the whole dressing room and everything went very well 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.580
 Victor not worked too 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.869

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.969
