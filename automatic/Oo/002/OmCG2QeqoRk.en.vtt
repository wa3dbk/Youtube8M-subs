00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you're just trying to know sort of just

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.340 
you're just trying to know sort of just
go<00:01:25.290> over<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.799> see<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:30.350> defenses

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
go over you know how to see if defenses

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.399 
go over you know how to see if defenses
in<00:01:31.560> Manning's<00:01:31.950> own<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.400> say<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.450> concentrate

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
in Manning's own I say just concentrate

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.649 
in Manning's own I say just concentrate
on<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.890> side<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> ball<00:01:35.670> concentrate<00:01:36.420> on

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
on one side of the ball concentrate on

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
on one side of the ball concentrate on
one<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.130> ball<00:01:38.340> where<00:01:38.640> there's<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
one side of the ball where there's a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.050 
one side of the ball where there's a
curl<00:01:39.390> flat<00:01:39.960> concept<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.369> we're<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.790> even

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
curl flat concept so we're not even

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
curl flat concept so we're not even
going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.659> about<00:01:42.990> Hernandez<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
going to think about Hernandez in this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.999 
going to think about Hernandez in this
particular<00:01:44.840> session<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
particular session we're going to just

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
particular session we're going to just
concentrate<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.729> Gronkowski<00:01:48.570> shiancoe<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
concentrate on Gronkowski shiancoe and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
concentrate on Gronkowski shiancoe and
Lloyd<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> especially<00:01:50.790> Lloyd<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> shiancoe

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
Lloyd and especially Lloyd and shiancoe

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.190 
Lloyd and especially Lloyd and shiancoe
who<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.530> running<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> curl<00:01:53.189> flat<00:01:53.490> concept

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
who are running the curl flat concept

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.010 
who are running the curl flat concept
against<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> cover<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.950> D<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> let's<00:01:57.899> see

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
against this cover for D so let's see

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.550 
against this cover for D so let's see
what<00:01:58.200> happens<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.430> snap<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> ball

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.680 

so<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.520> noticed<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:10.880> flat<00:02:11.880> was<00:02:12.120> wide<00:02:12.360> open

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
so as you noticed the flat was wide open

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
so as you noticed the flat was wide open
but<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.410> lot<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.800> times<00:02:14.690> Thomas<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.580> guy<00:02:17.849> right

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but a lot of times Thomas this guy right

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
but a lot of times Thomas this guy right
here<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.630> supposed<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.200> into<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.440> buzz

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
here that's supposed to go into a buzz

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.490 
here that's supposed to go into a buzz
owned<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.310> lot<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.940> times<00:02:21.300> he'll<00:02:21.569> come<00:02:21.840> over<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
owned a lot of times he'll come over and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820 
owned a lot of times he'll come over and
check<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.940> flat<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.569> leave<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.200> curl<00:02:25.530> open

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
check the flat and leave the curl open

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.270 
check the flat and leave the curl open
so<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.670> important<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:28.650> know<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:29.040> patient

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
so it's important to you know be patient

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.820 
so it's important to you know be patient
and<00:02:30.060> read<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.690> when<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.019> know<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.620> zone

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
and read that when you know it's a zone

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.470 
and read that when you know it's a zone
so<00:02:32.010> let's<00:02:32.220> let's<00:02:32.430> try<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.760> again<00:02:35.269> see<00:02:36.269> how<00:02:36.420> he

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
so let's let's try it again see how he

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.059 
so let's let's try it again see how he
went<00:02:36.840> over<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> flat<00:02:39.890> let's<00:02:40.890> run

went over to the to the flat let's run

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.309 
went over to the to the flat let's run
it<00:02:41.100> one<00:02:41.340> more<00:02:41.489> time

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.739 

alright<00:02:49.189> let's<00:02:49.370> take<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.579> look<00:02:49.849> at<00:02:49.939> it<00:02:49.999> instant

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:50.749 
alright let's take a look at it instant

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.599 
alright let's take a look at it instant

the<00:03:19.519> curl<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.590> know<00:03:21.739> what<00:03:21.889> you're<00:03:22.069> saying

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
the curl so I know what you're saying

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.220 
the curl so I know what you're saying
because<00:03:22.519> I've<00:03:22.879> said<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.419> to<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.750> know<00:03:23.900> why

can't we just put a spotlight on Lloyd

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.309 
can't we just put a spotlight on Lloyd
and<00:03:27.769> therefore<00:03:28.760> Thomas<00:03:29.480> should<00:03:29.689> just<00:03:29.930> come

shiancoe on the flat because ideally if
it's<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.250> third<00:03:37.639> and<00:03:37.909> ten<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.359> really<00:03:38.629> don't

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it's like third and ten you really don't

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.629 
it's like third and ten you really don't
care<00:03:38.989> about<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.260> flat<00:03:39.620> give<00:03:40.069> up<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.400> flat

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
care about the flat give up the flat

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:15.039 
flat so let's let's let's try it again

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.839 
flat so let's let's let's try it again
this<00:04:16.039> time<00:04:16.400> we're<00:04:16.729> going<00:04:16.849> to<00:04:16.909> just<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.539> know

you learned about curl flat concept and
how<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:39.450> works<00:05:39.660> again<00:05:39.990> soon<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.669> make

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
how it works again soon you can make

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.830 
how it works again soon you can make
