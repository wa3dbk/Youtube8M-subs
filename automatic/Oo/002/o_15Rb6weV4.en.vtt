said you can physically see them looking

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
said you can physically see them looking
through<00:01:28.140> where's<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> coming<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> man

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
through where's that coming from the man

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
through where's that coming from the man
behind<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.020> technology<00:01:31.320> explains<00:01:32.220> yeah<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
behind the technology explains yeah the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.429 
behind the technology explains yeah the
TV<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.390> playing<00:01:33.659> through<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> DVD<00:01:34.229> player

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
TV is playing through the DVD player

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
TV is playing through the DVD player
we're<00:01:35.100> taking<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.460> signal<00:01:35.880> we're

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
we're taking that signal we're

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
we're taking that signal we're
converting<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.689> running<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> soon<00:01:37.350> encoder<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
converting it running a soon encoder and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
converting it running a soon encoder and
driving<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> devices<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.540> attached

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
driving the devices which are attached

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
driving the devices which are attached
to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> windows<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> window<00:01:41.520> becomes<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to the windows so the window becomes the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
to the windows so the window becomes the
speaker<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> whole<00:01:42.659> thing<00:01:42.990> speaker<00:01:43.649> yeah<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
speaker this whole thing speaker yeah so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.490 
speaker this whole thing speaker yeah so
the<00:01:44.280> whole<00:01:44.430> area<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.840> routing<00:01:46.229> about

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the whole area know is out routing about

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
the whole area know is out routing about
30<00:01:46.770> watts<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.130> power<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:47.970> you're<00:01:48.090> seeing

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
30 watts of power so what you're seeing
