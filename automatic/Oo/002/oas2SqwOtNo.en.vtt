maybe five strokes per side and be back
in<00:00:51.120> business<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> 1600<00:00:54.629> grit

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
micron diamond paste which will refine

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.740 
micron diamond paste which will refine
the<00:01:06.600> edge<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:07.979> wicked<00:01:08.280> sharp

and away motion

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
and away motion
like<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:20.780> doesn't<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.049> long<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.469> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
like this doesn't take very long for the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.929 
like this doesn't take very long for the
polish<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> start<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> come<00:01:24.119> back

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
polish to really start to come back

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.260 
polish to really start to come back
especially<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> leather<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> just

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
especially with the leather and just

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.399 
especially with the leather and just
inspecting<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.049> already<00:01:31.289> looking

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
inspecting and it's already looking

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.370 
inspecting and it's already looking
really<00:01:31.979> good

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.499 

and<00:01:37.380> seeing<00:01:38.219> them<00:01:38.399> blade<00:01:38.670> off<00:01:38.850> again<00:01:39.179> before<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and seeing them blade off again before I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.870 
and seeing them blade off again before I
switch<00:01:39.810> grits

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:02:00.459

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.779 

at<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.009> point<00:02:01.280> then<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> should<00:02:01.759> be

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
at this point then it should be

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.510 
at this point then it should be
incredibly<00:02:02.390> sharp<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.950> test<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.340> with

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
incredibly sharp and I can test it with

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.429 
incredibly sharp and I can test it with
just<00:02:04.700> my<00:02:04.819> finger<00:02:05.210> nail<00:02:05.359> here<00:02:05.659> another<00:02:06.200> great

just my finger nail here another great
way<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.590> test<00:02:06.859> it<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.069> without<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.670> mechanical

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.869 
way to test it is without the mechanical
pencil<00:02:08.569> or<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.049> ballpoint<00:02:09.410> pen<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.489> can<00:02:10.549> just

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
pencil or a ballpoint pen you can just

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.720 
pencil or a ballpoint pen you can just
set<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.799> plastic<00:02:12.799> against<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.220> edge<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
set the plastic against the edge if it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.270 
set the plastic against the edge if it
bites<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.180> at<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.450> pretty<00:02:14.629> sharp<00:02:14.900> angle<00:02:15.379> then

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
bites in at a pretty sharp angle then

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.280 
bites in at a pretty sharp angle then
you<00:02:16.430> know<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.239> sharp<00:02:17.569> another

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you know that it's really sharp another

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.130 
you know that it's really sharp another
cool<00:02:18.560> thing<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.739> can<00:02:18.830> do<00:02:19.069> with<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> pen<00:02:19.489> or<00:02:20.140> or

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
cool thing you can do with the pen or or

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.690 
cool thing you can do with the pen or or
mechanical<00:02:21.739> pencil<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.129> is<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
mechanical pencil like this is just to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.180 
mechanical pencil like this is just to
run<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.150> all<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> way<00:02:24.349> down<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.769> edge<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.099> if

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
run it all the way down the edge and if

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.039 
run it all the way down the edge and if
you<00:02:25.280> feel<00:02:25.459> any<00:02:25.700> little<00:02:25.940> bumps<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.750> know<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
you feel any little bumps you know that

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.780 
you feel any little bumps you know that
the<00:02:27.140> blades<00:02:27.349> got<00:02:27.560> some<00:02:27.769> small<00:02:28.040> nick<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.549> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the blades got some small nick in it and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.920 
the blades got some small nick in it and
you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.030> come<00:02:29.239> back<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:29.810> work

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
you can come back and do a little work

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.470 
you can come back and do a little work
on<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.319> section<00:02:30.709> but<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:32.060> thing<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.390> in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
on that section but this thing is in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.839 
on that section but this thing is in
great<00:02:32.510> shape<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.370> think<00:02:34.370> we're<00:02:34.489> just<00:02:34.519> about

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
great shape I think we're just about

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.110 
great shape I think we're just about
done<00:02:34.910> with<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.950> pop<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.640> out<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> clamp

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
done with it so pop it out of the clamp

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.580 
done with it so pop it out of the clamp
here

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 

and<00:02:43.709> grab<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> piece<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.670> paper<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.330> we

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
and grab a piece of paper and see how we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:55.880 
and grab a piece of paper and see how we
did<00:02:51.290> yeah<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.920> 17<00:02:53.250> degrees<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.890> 3.5

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
did yeah so at 17 degrees with a 3.5

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.020 
did yeah so at 17 degrees with a 3.5
micron<00:02:56.310> polish<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.910> mean<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.360> crazy<00:02:57.900> sharp

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
micron polish I mean it was crazy sharp

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.660 
micron polish I mean it was crazy sharp
and<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.720> nice<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.670> extra

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and the nice thing is with that extra

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.860 
and the nice thing is with that extra
bit<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.819> refining<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.450> edge<00:03:03.599> you're

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
bit of refining of the edge you're

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.940 
bit of refining of the edge you're
removing<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.290> lot<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> those<00:03:04.560> little<00:03:04.769> micro

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
removing a lot of those little micro

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
removing a lot of those little micro
teeth<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.000> why<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.390> able<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.599> go

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
teeth which is why it's able to go

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.170 
teeth which is why it's able to go
through<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> paper<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.470> easily<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.069> an<00:03:08.849> added

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
through the paper so easily and an added

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
through the paper so easily and an added
benefit<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.560> edge<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> more

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
benefit of that is that the edge is more

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.460 
benefit of that is that the edge is more
durable<00:03:11.280> it'll<00:03:12.120> hold<00:03:12.330> up<00:03:12.510> longer<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> use<00:03:13.110> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
durable it'll hold up longer to use so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.610 
durable it'll hold up longer to use so
this<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:15.060> me<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> perfect<00:03:15.510> kind<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.200> amount

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
this is to me the perfect kind of amount

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.800 
this is to me the perfect kind of amount
of<00:03:16.709> finish<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> knife<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
of finish on the knife like this it's a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.840 
of finish on the knife like this it's a
good<00:03:18.959> good<00:03:19.500> hard<00:03:19.739> steel<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.430> take<00:03:20.640> that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
good good hard steel so it can take that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.380 
good good hard steel so it can take that
17<00:03:21.299> degree<00:03:21.540> angle<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.080> then<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> polish<00:03:23.459> is

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
17 degree angle and then the polish is

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.970 
17 degree angle and then the polish is
just<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> right<00:03:24.959> amount<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.440> leaves<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.830> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
just the right amount it leaves just a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.009 
just the right amount it leaves just a
little<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.580> tooth<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.510> edge<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
little bit of tooth in the edge so that

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.870 
little bit of tooth in the edge so that
it<00:03:28.410> grabs<00:03:28.620> onto<00:03:28.860> things<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.280> plastic<00:03:29.730> when

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it grabs onto things like plastic when

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.759 
it grabs onto things like plastic when
you're<00:03:29.970> cutting<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.930> it's<00:03:31.110> also<00:03:31.260> done<00:03:31.530> enough

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
you're cutting but it's also done enough

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.440 
you're cutting but it's also done enough
polish<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.670> efficient<00:03:33.120> moving

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
polish that it's very efficient moving

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.509 
polish that it's very efficient moving
through<00:03:33.630> material<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.380> it'll<00:03:35.069> be<00:03:35.190> more

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
through material and it'll be more

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.059 
through material and it'll be more
durable<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.299> again<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.560> Spyderco

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
durable so again this is the Spyderco

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.140 
durable so again this is the Spyderco
delica<00:03:38.690> sharpen<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> wicked<00:03:40.049> edge
