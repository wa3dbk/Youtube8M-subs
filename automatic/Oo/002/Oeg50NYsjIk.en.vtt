00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.820
 hello to all your cuckoo all must 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.780
 to 6 for a video 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.780
 everything so I 'm going 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.480
 sial 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.070
 to tell the truth, as a model of the very small 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.710
 small tax care or 0 1 is a follower 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 at the coloring a little special and I 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.830
 you book this coloring since a 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.360
 moment but you know when you are 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.730
 in a period of doubt you have 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.920
 not too much if you do a good thing 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.690
 or not so I watched this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.110
 coloring and finally I told myself 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.730
 good I'm going to do it so I 'm going 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 reuse this product line 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 I will use when I dyed my 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.969
 hair in black because I arrived 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.520
 in canada I had pretty much this style of 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.000
 colors and then had too much root 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.440
 and did not want to deal with them 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.940
 colorations and all with too much 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.050
 coloring and all so eventually 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.390
 I had the complexion the hair in black 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.100
 with this same range 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.619
 and this time I do the opposite I 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.509
 falls back into the day haka where I purple 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.810
 it will depend on how the rafters 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.380
 go out after that so I'm going to get ready 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.490
 to coloring and once I have 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 did my preparation 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:26.180
 we go there so here is so I separated my 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.930
 three-part head like this is 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.760
 behind the middle and as you may have 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:39.049
 to see it in front of me I made manias ok 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.090
 so I prepared the men bees and 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.810
 grandpa of the helium that will serve me 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.049
 to make my locks so time 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.900
 the course in the pot in the package of 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:57.170
 coloring you have your hand you 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.610
 have your develop your business and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:09.420
 to oxygenate it and you have your 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 developers here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 so I open as we could see 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 before I made this for vanilla 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.830
 it's easier for me to do my 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.830
 wicks and I forgot 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.489
 what is there 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 okay 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.400
 good as you could see it's I 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.270
 could not film the color sequence 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.430
 it was pretty tedious I even know 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.190
 not if it's okay so take as 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.030
 you can see I put something in 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.620
 plastic to emit heat and 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.670
 make sure that the color 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.770
 take I could but gig because my 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.420
 gloves are full of products 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.060
 so I will try to rinse and 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.600
 I really hope that the coloring 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.600
 learned 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.700
 so as you can see I put the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.560
 aluminum to prevent that the wicks that 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:54.440
 I have colored touches to the locks that 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.000
 I did not color and it was my 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.860
 really good luck because I am 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.290
 really in doubt about the result so 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:09.980
 on the left so I'm back the next day 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.690
 with my pseudo coloring so like 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.390
 you can see we see that slab 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.330
 there are some reflections if I 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.430
 close together we can see some wicks 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:26.660
 colorful parts your best masias 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:29.240
 taken as here as somewhere there 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.060
 but it's only reflections so super 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.740
 disappointed I did not want to beatty my hair 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.930
 because it makes too much light 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.180
 the hair so I have some reflections 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.650
 hot super disappointed against against I 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:48.440
 believe that it took well but I am 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.830
 not sure so already the color I have 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.450
 taking 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.390
 I was disappointed because I wanted 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.900
 something red and it's not 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:02.270
 the case so I have that reflection in the 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:05.510
 light but otherwise I'm disappointed disappointed 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.600
 disappointed disappointed his limits I want to 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:13.240
 buy back the box and put back on 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.240
 the hair so yeah good total total 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.240

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:27.860

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:31.840
