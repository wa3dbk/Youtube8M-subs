00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
my regular caterpillar engine and that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
my regular caterpillar engine and that
happens<00:00:21.810> every<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.470> need<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
happens every now and then just need to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
happens every now and then just need to
do<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:24.289> because<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.859> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
do that because because of the way it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.460 
do that because because of the way it
works<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:27.630> motor<00:00:27.840> doesn't<00:00:28.050> charge<00:00:28.289> are

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
works that motor doesn't charge are

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
works that motor doesn't charge are
properly<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.400> yeah<00:00:29.820> turning<00:00:30.210> off<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
properly but yeah turning off for a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.910 
properly but yeah turning off for a
little<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.960> every<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> then<00:00:32.239> fix<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.920> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
little bit every now and then fix it so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.260 
little bit every now and then fix it so
it<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.640> move<00:00:35.910> along<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.610> turn<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> off

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it can move along and I can turn it off

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.220 
it can move along and I can turn it off
and<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.239> drop<00:00:42.719> TNT<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and it can drop TNT so the way this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.810 
and it can drop TNT so the way this
works<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> load<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> deployers

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
works is it's got a load of deployers

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.670 
works is it's got a load of deployers
and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:48.960> toggle<00:00:49.289> latches

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and then just a little toggle latches

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.950 
and then just a little toggle latches
set<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.789> set<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> off

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.799 

so<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.040> just<00:00:59.070> reek<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> wreak<00:01:00.480> havoc

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so I can just reek a bit on wreak havoc

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:17.180 
so I can just reek a bit on wreak havoc
on<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.170> environment<00:01:03.320> boom<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.420> yeah<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
on the environment boom and yeah so I

on the environment boom and yeah so I
don't<00:01:17.820> even<00:01:18.090> need<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> turn<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
don't even need to turn off the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.830 
don't even need to turn off the
caterpillar<00:01:19.770> engine<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.399> just<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> havoc

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840
