00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
it looks very nice very clean I think in

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.440 
it looks very nice very clean I think in
very<00:03:57.890> professional-looking<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.670> my<00:03:59.940> opinion

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
very professional-looking in my opinion

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.229 
very professional-looking in my opinion
I<00:04:00.660> mean<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.530> colors<00:04:01.980> work<00:04:02.340> together<00:04:02.610> in<00:04:03.150> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
I mean the colors work together in a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.470 
I mean the colors work together in a
professional<00:04:03.810> way<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.980> guess<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.820> can't<00:04:06.239> freeze

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
professional way I guess I can't freeze

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.440 
professional way I guess I can't freeze
corrected<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.430> anyways<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.120> also<00:04:09.269> be

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
corrected it anyways this can also be

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.110 
corrected it anyways this can also be
done<00:04:09.570> if<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> say<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> pull<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:11.880> layer

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
done if you know I say I pull this layer

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.270 
done if you know I say I pull this layer
and<00:04:12.299> put<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.660> top<00:04:12.959> yeah<00:04:13.410> that's<00:04:13.709> not<00:04:13.860> normal

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
and put it on top yeah that's not normal

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.750 
and put it on top yeah that's not normal
but<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.760> multiply<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:16.169> still<00:04:16.530> looks<00:04:16.769> good<00:04:17.010> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
but it I multiply it still looks good so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.490 
but it I multiply it still looks good so

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
difference there is between right here

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.029 
difference there is between right here
like<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.669> didn't<00:04:52.029> cook<00:04:52.409> color<00:04:53.409> that<00:04:53.680> part<00:04:53.979> of

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
like I didn't cook color that part of

like I didn't cook color that part of
the<00:04:54.129> ear<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.550> didn't<00:04:54.819> get<00:04:54.969> on<00:04:55.060> top<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.479> the

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
the ear and I didn't get on top of the

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.499 
the ear and I didn't get on top of the
arm<00:04:55.719> compared<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:57.069> you<00:04:57.370> know<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.729> hand<00:04:57.999> it

arm compared to you know the hand it

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.600 
arm compared to you know the hand it
does<00:04:58.840> make<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.139> dramatic<00:04:59.319> difference<00:04:59.620> and
