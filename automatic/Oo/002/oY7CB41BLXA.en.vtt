00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 So the people here are going to show me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.570
 a video for you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.049
 explaining the settings of the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.420
 game that gives to change what it does not give is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.210
 depending on the use of each one you can 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.189
 put it in the way that you think is best 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 so here are people after 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 You enter the 8 or he is on this screen 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 with everybody knows they play there me 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 weird off line 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 then here or in the lower left corner 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 this neighbor gear we will click 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.629
 in her 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 here my account is with facebook 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.120
 could be with the game account also 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 mini clip more games see not have by 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.660
 what 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.860
 more information and only speaks credits 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.129
 of the program, right? 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 We need to see tutorial here. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 it will show how that playing but 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.460
 I believe most of you know options 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 play that language 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 if someone wants to speak a preferred right 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 another English Spanish language and prefers 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.610
 I like charlie with 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.610
 live sound of this crucible everything else 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.610
 important sensitivity of the club I 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.729
 I prefer to leave the sensitivity of the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.130
 taxi and hence if you put in a quick 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 you just slide your finger on the screen that the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 taco had already become very fast abnormal I think 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.400
 very fast 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.920
 so I'd rather leave 30 than that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.049
 taco religion for the game the cleanest 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 possible you slide your finger 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 I think it's best for when the ball 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.649
 is in a very large queue of people 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 take it very slowly 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.439
 if you have fast you can not aim 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.780
 exactly where you want to break our 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.380
 I think the vibration gets in the way of you playing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.329
 a touch to look at this one or 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.159
 both for aiming and also for 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.740
 For me it was not good as it is the touch 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.989
 to generally aim for people to go to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.620
 people have to hold their finger on the screen and 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.650
 slip and back doing here 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.349
 I will when associative ring for me 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.349
 will go as soon as you explain with your finger 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.090
 some point mine is already going there only the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.519
 What happens, I got really bad at 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.019
 because I often turned around 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.159
 well placed on the altar where I wanted 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.250
 right 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.370
 at the time I was going to use the force to give 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.709
 the shot did not like on the screen change the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.750
 bat position and then 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.610
 sometimes you may even end up losing 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.470
 game time losing game because of 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.470
 I still do not like it very much 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:53.700
 to Disable Tab Lines in Offline Mode 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 so I sometimes give an active network 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.920
 they here I train so my craze 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.170
 I just prefer to stay with nobody to 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.200
 guide then I try to leave them always 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.989
 activate soon I'll enter the mode 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.040
 offline for us train some 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.810
 types of play which gives to make the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.329
 location of power base the mayor 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.940
 left and right 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:23.310
 her orientation vertically also 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:31.139
 I prefer it than horizontally 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:37.019
 annoying game alerts 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:40.019
 if you think it is bad not know 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.180
 which you can disable here 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.870
 There was a time that I already had that was not 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.609
 really liking and maybe sanchez to tv 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.220
 here we can dictate the order of 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.970
 mands chat so here for example this 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.879
 are the options that the next one can use to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.349
 We want people to tell us 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.470
 he does not show up there sometimes sometimes 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.650
 Name you do not like everyone is difficult 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.650
 If you find you can move up or 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:14.370
 down and see which you prefer 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:17.820
 use as a friend and I leave for everything 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.280
 world that could leave no one 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.260
 allow the challenge to everyone or 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.150
 only friends, I also think 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.760
 that never someone who is not a friend 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.540
 challenge but I leave it that way 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.330
 automatic rotation of the screen and I already did 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.190
 this happens sometimes you reach the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.960
 cell or the right cell to act or 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.940
 there are people who can sometimes prefer 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.170
 I just do not like it because what? 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.750
 I use a lot happens for mobile working 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.450
 to watch shows that I'm going to play 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.270
 if you leave the screen rotation turned on 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.130
 and will come to opt in our home until 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.950
 and can not see where you are 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.330
 Do you want to attack me then? 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.890
 served very well 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.100
 disabled if you want then these are 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:12.090
 the game settings here 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:20.210
 So what happens is that more than we 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:20.210
 here is my week's league competition 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.290

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:32.550
