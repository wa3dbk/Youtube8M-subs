 this midibus is going to ride on the less 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.720
 busy lines in the east of the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840

 traveling with that qliner and that is anyway 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.450
 especially commuters actually the working day 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.130
 starts the moment they get on the bus 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 steps that we had over the other 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.310

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.970
 cameras 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.060

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.680
 from front rijnmond fabrics and also less 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.480
 energy consumed that is also good 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.220
 for the environment and for humans 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.660
