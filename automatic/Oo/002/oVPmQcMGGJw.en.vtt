00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's even to the point where I think

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's even to the point where I think

I I had that realization at some point
like<00:03:16.520> this<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> lot<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:19.040> process<00:03:19.550> that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
like this is a lot like the process that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.940 
like this is a lot like the process that
other<00:03:20.090> climbers<00:03:20.450> go<00:03:20.750> through<00:03:21.050> on<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.410> mountain

on<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.990> lot<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.650> climb<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.280> gym<00:03:28.520> most

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
on a lot of climb in the gym most

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.960 
on a lot of climb in the gym most
climbers<00:03:29.840> can<00:03:30.260> relate<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.740> on<00:03:30.890> some<00:03:31.130> level<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
climbers can relate to on some level the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.610 
climbers can relate to on some level the
scale<00:03:32.270> of<00:03:32.450> these<00:03:32.570> things<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.170> different

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
scale of these things is so different

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.770 
scale of these things is so different
but<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.910> core<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.210> them<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.660> this

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
but the at the core of them is this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.720 
but the at the core of them is this
experience<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.800> if<00:03:37.340> you've<00:03:37.490> tried

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
experience that if you've tried

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.820 
experience that if you've tried
something<00:03:38.030> more<00:03:38.360> than<00:03:38.510> once<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.960> know<00:03:39.800> that

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
something more than once you know that

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.880 
something more than once you know that
frustration<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.850> know<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.120> process<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.960> I

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
frustration you know the process and I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.000 
frustration you know the process and I
think<00:03:43.340> that's<00:03:43.490> really<00:03:43.760> cool<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.500> dawn<00:03:45.740> wall

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
think that's really cool the dawn wall

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.590 
think that's really cool the dawn wall
was<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.490> route<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:46.880> was<00:03:47.060> looking<00:03:47.210> at<00:03:47.360> for

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
was the route that I was looking at for

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.160 
was the route that I was looking at for
years<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.210> I<00:03:50.210> had<00:03:50.480> kind<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.750> pieced<00:03:51.020> together

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
years and I had kind of pieced together

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.720 
years and I had kind of pieced together
the<00:03:51.530> whole<00:03:51.680> thing<00:03:51.890> except<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.400> one

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
the whole thing except for this one

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.600 
the whole thing except for this one
obvious<00:03:53.210> blank<00:03:53.510> section<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.280> there's<00:03:55.280> I

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
obvious blank section and there's I

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.490 
obvious blank section and there's I
looked<00:03:55.910> at<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:56.330> saw<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:56.840> potential

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
looked at it and saw this potential

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.560 
looked at it and saw this potential
ridiculous-looking<00:03:58.250> dinah<00:03:58.820> but<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.180> kind<00:03:59.540> of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
ridiculous-looking dinah but I kind of

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.150 
ridiculous-looking dinah but I kind of
wrote<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.870> off<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.260> looked<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:00.710> another

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
wrote it off and I looked for another

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.940 
wrote it off and I looked for another
month<00:04:01.700> trying<00:04:02.210> to<00:04:02.270> swing<00:04:02.540> around<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.320> find

month trying to swing around and find
ways<00:04:04.160> around<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:04.820> ventually<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.270> just<00:04:05.510> got

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
ways around it and ventually I just got

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.270 
ways around it and ventually I just got
the<00:04:05.810> one<00:04:05.990> I<00:04:06.050> was<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.260> that's<00:04:06.560> how<00:04:06.950> it's<00:04:07.160> gonna

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
the one I was like that's how it's gonna

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.410 
the one I was like that's how it's gonna
have<00:04:07.490> to<00:04:07.580> go<00:04:07.730> you're<00:04:07.880> gonna<00:04:07.970> have<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> do<00:04:08.300> this

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
have to go you're gonna have to do this

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.229 
have to go you're gonna have to do this
absurd<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:09.050> know

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.990 

so<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.049> actual<00:04:16.820> dimensions<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
so I have the actual dimensions of the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.180 
so I have the actual dimensions of the
dinah<00:04:18.269> worked<00:04:18.570> out<00:04:18.780> but<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.049> put<00:04:19.380> t<00:04:19.829> not<00:04:20.010> holes

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
dinah worked out but I put t not holes

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.700 
dinah worked out but I put t not holes
every<00:04:20.430> six<00:04:21.019> incrementally<00:04:22.019> every<00:04:22.260> six<00:04:22.560> inches

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
every six incrementally every six inches

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
every six incrementally every six inches
closer<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.610> could<00:04:23.790> move<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.090> hole<00:04:24.240> closer

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
closer so I could move the hole closer

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.480 
closer so I could move the hole closer
and<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.380> start<00:04:25.680> with<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.830> smaller<00:04:26.160> Dino

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
and you know start with a smaller Dino

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.129 
and you know start with a smaller Dino
and<00:04:26.730> then<00:04:26.850> work<00:04:27.000> my<00:04:27.030> way<00:04:27.210> up<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.750> actual

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
and then work my way up to the actual

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.700 
and then work my way up to the actual
distance<00:04:28.639> he<00:04:29.639> kind<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:29.910> ventures<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.389> am<00:04:30.720> NT

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
distance he kind of ventures I am NT

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.379 
distance he kind of ventures I am NT
take<00:04:31.980> hard<00:04:32.280> free<00:04:32.520> climbing<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.180> think

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
take hard free climbing and I think

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.600 
take hard free climbing and I think
training<00:04:34.110> up<00:04:34.200> my<00:04:34.320> booty<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.770> probably<00:04:35.490> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
training up my booty is probably the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820 
training up my booty is probably the
most<00:04:35.760> effective<00:04:36.290> efficient<00:04:37.290> way<00:04:37.440> for<00:04:37.470> me<00:04:37.710> to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
most effective efficient way for me to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:05:53.730 
most effective efficient way for me to
get<00:04:37.919> better<00:04:38.100> at<00:04:38.310> that

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.730 

but<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.280> project<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.940> that<00:05:55.120> big<00:05:55.479> is<00:05:55.900> total

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
but a project of that big is total

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.850 
but a project of that big is total
emotional

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
emotional

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.130 
emotional

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
so I've given up at least twice and then

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.900 
so I've given up at least twice and then
something<00:06:00.530> starts<00:06:00.830> eating<00:06:01.190> at<00:06:01.310> me<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.670> feel
