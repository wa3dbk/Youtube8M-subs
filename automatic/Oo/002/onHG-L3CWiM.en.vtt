00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
envision it and the way that I work it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.139 
envision it and the way that I work it
out<00:01:18.170> what<00:01:18.350> kind<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.619> strategy<00:01:19.159> can<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:19.399> have<00:01:19.820> and

that<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.330> yes<00:02:14.750> it's<00:02:15.020> very<00:02:15.530> loose<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.130> it's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that so yes it's very loose and it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
that so yes it's very loose and it's
very<00:02:16.459> playful<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.840> need<00:02:18.470> something<00:02:18.920> more

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
very playful but I need something more

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.340 
very playful but I need something more
than<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.690> discovered<00:02:21.319> for

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
than that and I have discovered for

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.089 
than that and I have discovered for
myself<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.970> when<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.390> wanted<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.170> loosen<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.830> I

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
myself that when I wanted to loosen up I

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.750 
myself that when I wanted to loosen up I
actually<00:02:26.030> needed<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:26.959> get<00:02:27.140> really

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
actually needed to get really

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.270 
actually needed to get really
with<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.689> I<00:02:28.720> learned<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.920> shapes

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
with it so that I learned the shapes

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.460 
with it so that I learned the shapes
that<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.640> was<00:02:30.909> seeing<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.330> memorized<00:02:32.140> them

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
that I was seeing I memorized them

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.610 
that I was seeing I memorized them
visually<00:02:33.099> as<00:02:33.280> well<00:02:33.340> as<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.879> trained<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:34.510> hand<00:02:34.959> to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
visually as well as I trained my hand to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.490 
visually as well as I trained my hand to
make<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.099> shapes<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.730> after<00:02:37.060> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
make the shapes that I'm after and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.960 
make the shapes that I'm after and
thinking<00:02:38.500> about<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.040> colors<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.610> I'm<00:02:39.730> going

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
thinking about the colors that I'm going

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.360 
thinking about the colors that I'm going
to<00:02:40.060> use<00:02:40.269> beforehand<00:02:41.200> having<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.040> strategy

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
to use beforehand having a strategy

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.460 
to use beforehand having a strategy
whether<00:02:43.329> it's<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.810> I'm<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.260> my

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
whether it's that I'm going to make my

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.080 
whether it's that I'm going to make my
changes<00:02:44.890> according<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> color<00:02:45.790> or<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
changes according to the color or the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.020 
changes according to the color or the
value<00:02:46.659> or<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.810> intensity<00:02:47.610> again<00:02:48.610> what's<00:02:48.940> my

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
value or the intensity again what's my

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.979 
value or the intensity again what's my
game<00:02:49.329> plan<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.819> with<00:02:52.629> that

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
game plan on this going in with that

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.420 
game plan on this going in with that
decision<00:02:53.829> before<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.489> start<00:02:55.269> before<00:02:55.599> I<00:02:56.370> hit<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
decision before I start before I hit the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
decision before I start before I hit the
paint<00:02:57.819> with<00:02:58.030> hit-the<00:02:58.750> hit-the<00:02:59.170> paper<00:02:59.439> with

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
paint with hit-the hit-the paper with

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.460 
paint with hit-the hit-the paper with
color<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.299> have<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.569> what<00:03:01.750> I'm<00:03:01.900> doing<00:03:02.319> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
color I have to know what I'm doing and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
color I have to know what I'm doing and
when<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.829> go<00:03:03.099> in<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.700> kind<00:03:03.970> of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
when I go in with that kind of

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.360 
when I go in with that kind of
confidence<00:03:04.420> oh<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.560> that's<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.129> best

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
confidence oh that's the that's the best

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.339 
confidence oh that's the that's the best
way<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.579> loosen<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.200> then

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
way to loosen up is to do it and then

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.319 
way to loosen up is to do it and then
you<00:03:08.470> end<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.799> with<00:03:08.859> some<00:03:09.220> kind<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.519> result<00:03:09.909> that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
you end up with some kind of result that

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.449 
you end up with some kind of result that
you're<00:03:10.510> happy<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.870> instead<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:11.950> some

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
you're happy with instead of just some

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.780 
you're happy with instead of just some
kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.909> color<00:03:13.239> riot<00:03:13.659> or<00:03:14.159> massive<00:03:15.159> paint<00:03:15.519> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
kind of color riot or massive paint and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.160 
kind of color riot or massive paint and
even<00:03:16.299> though<00:03:16.420> you've<00:03:16.569> had<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:16.959> great

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
even though you've had a really great

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.890 
even though you've had a really great
time<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.829> you've<00:03:17.950> got<00:03:18.159> loose<00:03:18.569> what's<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.780> end

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
time and you've got loose what's the end

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.960 
time and you've got loose what's the end
result<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.530> how<00:03:21.190> do<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.370> take<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.639> from<00:03:21.760> there

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
result and how do you take it from there

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.379 
result and how do you take it from there
so<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> think<00:03:22.440> my<00:03:23.519> best<00:03:24.519> advice<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.940> somebody

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
so I think my best advice to somebody

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.009 
so I think my best advice to somebody
who<00:03:25.989> wants<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.829> loosen<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:28.150> think<00:03:28.569> and

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
who wants to loosen up is to think and

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.220 
who wants to loosen up is to think and
plan<00:03:29.500> before<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.310> paint<00:03:30.670> even<00:03:31.629> if<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.930> just

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
plan before you paint even if you just

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.140 
plan before you paint even if you just
take<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.500> few<00:03:32.829> minutes<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.519> think<00:03:33.699> about<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
take a few minutes to think about the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.759 
take a few minutes to think about the
shapes<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.660> you're<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.169> to<00:03:35.230> make<00:03:35.440> and

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
shapes that you're going to make and

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.580 
shapes that you're going to make and
your<00:03:36.220> color<00:03:36.519> choices<00:03:37.199> before<00:03:38.199> you<00:03:38.410> get

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
your color choices before you get

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.229 
your color choices before you get
yourself<00:03:39.040> into<00:03:39.340> trouble<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.910> then<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.090> say

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
yourself into trouble and then you say

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.610 
yourself into trouble and then you say
well<00:03:40.449> what<00:03:40.660> am<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.199> do<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.560> start

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
well what am I going to do and you start

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.240 
well what am I going to do and you start
rummaging<00:03:42.370> through<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.669> paints<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.419> and

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
rummaging through your paints and and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.099 
rummaging through your paints and and
making<00:03:45.250> up<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.730> not<00:03:45.940> having<00:03:45.970> any<00:03:46.480> decisions

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
making up for not having any decisions

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.189 
making up for not having any decisions
so<00:03:47.470> yeah<00:03:47.889> go<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.400> think<00:03:49.090> first<00:03:49.359> before<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.109> go

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
so yeah go in think first before you go

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.699 
so yeah go in think first before you go
in<00:03:50.349> I'm<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.760> home<00:03:52.090> right<00:03:52.359> now<00:03:52.389> I'm<00:03:53.019> having<00:03:53.440> just

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
in I'm at home right now I'm having just

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.009 
in I'm at home right now I'm having just
a<00:03:53.829> blast<00:03:54.129> working<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:54.910> some<00:03:55.239> birds<00:03:55.569> it's

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
a blast working on some birds it's

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.409 
a blast working on some birds it's
something<00:03:56.530> actually<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.419> started

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
something actually that I started

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.050 
something actually that I started
working<00:03:58.599> on<00:03:58.930> as<00:03:59.139> child<00:03:59.620> my<00:04:00.160> very<00:04:00.699> first

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
working on as child my very first

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.199 
working on as child my very first
painting<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.019> ever<00:04:02.260> did<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.549> a<00:04:03.730> class

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
painting that I ever did in a in a class

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.089 
painting that I ever did in a in a class
I<00:04:04.510> think<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.810> was<00:04:04.959> probably<00:04:05.440> about<00:04:05.680> six<00:04:05.949> years

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
I think it was probably about six years

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.849 
I think it was probably about six years
old<00:04:06.370> was<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> little<00:04:07.299> bird<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.049> I've<00:04:08.290> returned

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
old was a little bird so I've returned

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.979 
old was a little bird so I've returned
back<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.790> now<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.239> course<00:04:10.419> I'm<00:04:10.629> style

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
back to that now of course I'm style

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.509 
back to that now of course I'm style
izing<00:04:11.560> them<00:04:11.709> I'm<00:04:11.949> working<00:04:12.340> with<00:04:12.489> my

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
izing them I'm working with my

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.520 
izing them I'm working with my
strategies<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.480> negative<00:04:13.870> painting<00:04:14.349> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
strategies of negative painting and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.890 
strategies of negative painting and
building<00:04:15.190> them<00:04:15.310> up<00:04:15.459> I'm<00:04:15.699> having<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.419> much<00:04:16.570> fun

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
building them up I'm having so much fun

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.830 
building them up I'm having so much fun
studying<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.340> again<00:04:19.090> drawing<00:04:19.599> them

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
studying that and and again drawing them

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.339 
studying that and and again drawing them
out<00:04:19.930> meticulously<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.159> then<00:04:22.199> painting<00:04:23.199> them

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
out meticulously and then painting them

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.649 
out meticulously and then painting them
in<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.830> very<00:04:24.190> typical<00:04:24.460> positive<00:04:25.360> fashion

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
in a very typical positive fashion

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.529 
in a very typical positive fashion
before<00:04:26.349> I<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.949> make<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.280> shift<00:04:27.639> over<00:04:27.909> so<00:04:28.510> I

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
before I can make that shift over so I

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.240 
before I can make that shift over so I
have<00:04:29.050> been<00:04:29.199> working<00:04:29.560> through<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.800> series<00:04:30.220> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
have been working through a series of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.250 
have been working through a series of
that<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:31.270> other<00:04:31.389> thing<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.750> I'm<00:04:32.020> doing

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
that the other thing that I'm doing

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.040 
that the other thing that I'm doing
right<00:04:32.590> now<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:33.159> I'm<00:04:33.880> working<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.419> mylar<00:04:35.020> sheets

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
right now is I'm working on mylar sheets

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.950 
right now is I'm working on mylar sheets
of<00:04:35.500> mylar<00:04:35.889> with<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.250> acrylic<00:04:36.570> lots<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.750> really

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
of mylar with the acrylic lots of really

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440 
of mylar with the acrylic lots of really
cool<00:04:38.219> textures<00:04:39.219> that<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.820> create<00:04:40.090> with

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
cool textures that I can create with

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.020 
cool textures that I can create with
that<00:04:40.479> and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
that and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.030 
that and
building<00:04:41.480> up<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.780> layers<00:04:41.810> it's<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.440> super

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
building up the layers it's a super

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.120 
building up the layers it's a super
smooth<00:04:43.460> kind<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.480> surface<00:04:45.410> so<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.920> paint

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
smooth kind of surface so the paint

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.300 
smooth kind of surface so the paint
really<00:04:46.310> flows<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.090> can<00:04:47.180> make<00:04:47.330> lots<00:04:47.570> of

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
really flows and it can make lots of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.890 
really flows and it can make lots of
interesting<00:04:49.310> textures<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.300> I've<00:04:50.720> been

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
interesting textures with it I've been

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.280 
interesting textures with it I've been
doing<00:04:51.140> some<00:04:51.320> portrait<00:04:51.980> work<00:04:52.160> which<00:04:52.670> is<00:04:52.970> really

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.260 
doing some portrait work which is really
fun<00:04:54.290> challenging<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.430> me<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:56.000> that's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
direction I haven't worked with oils and

direction I haven't worked with oils and
since<00:05:09.920> I<00:05:10.100> was<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.340> teenager<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.540> yeah<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.770> is
