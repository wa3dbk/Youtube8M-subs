when<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.860> run<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.190> at<00:02:54.280> two<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.670> don't<00:02:55.030> know<00:02:55.090> maybe

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
when I run it at two I don't know maybe

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.820 
when I run it at two I don't know maybe
I'm<00:02:55.330> just<00:02:55.480> lucky<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.989> then<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.590> three

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
I'm just lucky and then we have three

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.220 
I'm just lucky and then we have three
trade<00:02:57.250> ins<00:02:57.430> three<00:02:57.790> cards<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.120> consonance<00:02:58.230> to

dragon<00:03:00.069> shrine<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.459> three<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.760> cloggy<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.239> my

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
dragon shrine and three is cloggy in my

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.910 
dragon shrine and three is cloggy in my
opinion<00:03:01.630> plus<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.110> deck<00:03:02.319> doesn't<00:03:02.530> really

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
opinion plus this deck doesn't really

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.170 
opinion plus this deck doesn't really
need<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.280> all<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.519> much<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.819> it's<00:03:03.970> great

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
need it all that much but it's great

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.479 
need it all that much but it's great

because you run to sole charge so that

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.250 
because you run to sole charge so that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
banishing quite a bit so you want to put

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.130 
banishing quite a bit so you want to put
some<00:03:21.940> dragons<00:03:22.269> back<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.600> your<00:03:22.690> grave<00:03:22.840> using

not three because artifacts and yeah not
one<00:03:29.290> because<00:03:29.709> why<00:03:30.040> we're<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.340> one<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.730> does

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
one because why we're in one that does

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.009 
one because why we're in one that does
make<00:03:30.970> sense<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.359> then<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.569> can<00:03:31.690> side<00:03:31.840> them

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
make sense and then you can side them

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.420 
make sense and then you can side them
out<00:03:32.109> for<00:03:32.260> other<00:03:32.350> stuff<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.799> haven't<00:03:33.280> done<00:03:33.370> a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
out for other stuff I haven't done a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.069 
out for other stuff I haven't done a
side<00:03:33.670> deck<00:03:33.880> for<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.150> yet<00:03:34.420> which<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:34.989> I

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
side deck for this yet which because I

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.180 
side deck for this yet which because I
haven't<00:03:35.230> even<00:03:35.380> decided<00:03:35.620> I'm<00:03:35.859> going<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.069> take

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
haven't even decided I'm going to take

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.620 
haven't even decided I'm going to take
it<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.400> turn<00:03:36.579> him<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.760> or<00:03:36.850> not<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.120> then<00:03:37.510> we

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
it to turn him it or not and then we

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.780 
it to turn him it or not and then we
have<00:03:37.780> one<00:03:38.049> dark<00:03:38.560> hole<00:03:38.799> because<00:03:39.190> as<00:03:39.430> your<00:03:39.700> eyes

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
have one dark hole because as your eyes

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.759 
have one dark hole because as your eyes
plus<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> dark<00:03:40.329> hole<00:03:40.540> equals<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.109> clear<00:03:41.560> field

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
plus the dark hole equals a clear field

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.370 
plus the dark hole equals a clear field
for<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.340> then<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.060> gotta<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.930> wiretap

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
for you and then you gotta to wiretap

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.809 
for you and then you gotta to wiretap
because<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.889> deck<00:03:45.040> will<00:03:45.220> lose<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> back<00:03:45.639> row

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
because this deck will lose the back row

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.330 
because this deck will lose the back row
again<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.180> know<00:03:46.269> kind<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.660> reason<00:03:46.930> for<00:03:47.340> MST

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
again you know kind of a reason for MST

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.800 
again you know kind of a reason for MST
now<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.579> run<00:03:48.730> into<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.940> deck<00:03:49.120> that's<00:03:49.150> got<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.540> ton

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
now you run into a deck that's got a ton

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.000 
now you run into a deck that's got a ton
of<00:03:49.840> back<00:03:50.139> row<00:03:50.319> it's<00:03:50.440> going<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.709> kind<00:03:50.829> of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
of back row it's going to be kind of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.160 
of back row it's going to be kind of
hard<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.459> get<00:03:52.239> over<00:03:52.299> it<00:03:52.660> because<00:03:52.780> you're<00:03:53.079> going

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
hard to get over it because you're going

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.199 
hard to get over it because you're going
to<00:03:53.260> waste<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.530> lot<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.680> resources<00:03:54.010> before<00:03:54.609> they

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
to waste a lot of resources before they

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.900 
to waste a lot of resources before they
even<00:03:55.450> get<00:03:55.690> their<00:03:55.900> stuff<00:03:56.139> on<00:03:56.319> board<00:03:56.670> yeah<00:03:57.670> and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
even get their stuff on board yeah and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.670 
even get their stuff on board yeah and
then<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.600> physics<00:03:59.079> we<00:03:59.319> were<00:03:59.440> blessed

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
then we have a physics we were blessed

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.710 
then we have a physics we were blessed
and<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.639> Phoenix<00:04:00.910> would<00:04:01.000> wind<00:04:01.180> blast<00:04:01.359> because

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
and a Phoenix would wind blast because

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.420 
and a Phoenix would wind blast because
they're<00:04:02.109> both<00:04:02.260> very<00:04:02.470> good<00:04:02.680> cards<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.100> decided

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
they're both very good cards I decided

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.550 
they're both very good cards I decided
to<00:04:03.579> go<00:04:03.819> for<00:04:03.970> two<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.209> these<00:04:04.329> rather<00:04:04.600> than<00:04:04.810> one

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
to go for two of these rather than one

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.530
