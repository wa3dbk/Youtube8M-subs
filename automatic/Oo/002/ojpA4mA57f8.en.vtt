noting<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.640> would<00:01:57.910> be<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> good<00:01:58.180> idea<00:01:58.330> if

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
noting that you would be a good idea if

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.440 
noting that you would be a good idea if
you<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.740> Magento<00:02:00.220> cron<00:02:00.670> setup

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
you have to have the Magento cron setup

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.060 
you have to have the Magento cron setup
in<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.690> background<00:02:02.110> no<00:02:02.200> motion<00:02:02.650> not<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:03.010> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
in the background no motion not going to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.650 
in the background no motion not going to
show<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.280> how<00:02:03.730> to<00:02:03.790> do<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.480> video

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
show you how to do that in this video

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.110 
show you how to do that in this video
but<00:02:05.140> underneath<00:02:05.980> this<00:02:06.280> video<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.670> YouTube

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
but underneath this video on YouTube

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.910 
but underneath this video on YouTube
we've<00:02:07.600> included<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.259> link<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.739> tutorial

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
we've included a link to the tutorial

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.859 
we've included a link to the tutorial
which<00:02:09.369> will<00:02:09.399> show<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.789> how<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.599> and

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
which will show you how to do that and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.739 
which will show you how to do that and
then<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.590> generate<00:02:12.219> the<00:02:12.579> sitemap<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.239> really

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.749 
then to generate the sitemap is really

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.980 
then to generate the sitemap is really
straightforward<00:02:14.019> now<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.799> begin<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.519> was

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
straightforward now to begin with I was

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620 
straightforward now to begin with I was
you<00:02:16.320> try<00:02:16.650> doing<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.980> manually<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.210> Crom

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you try doing it manually but the Crom

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.530 
you try doing it manually but the Crom
job<00:02:18.930> will<00:02:19.200> do<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.770> automatically<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
job will do this automatically in the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
job will do this automatically in the
background<00:02:21.990> for<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> two<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.100> run<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
background for you and two to run the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.400 
background for you and two to run the
cron<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.910> their<00:02:24.030> sort<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.390> run<00:02:24.630> will<00:02:25.020> generate

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
cron for their sort of run will generate

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.980 
cron for their sort of run will generate
the<00:02:25.950> sitemap<00:02:26.370> post<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.760> should<00:02:26.970> say<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.900> you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the sitemap post I should say is if you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.360 
the sitemap post I should say is if you
click<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> link<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> right<00:02:29.070> hand<00:02:29.280> side

click on the link on the right hand side
and<00:02:29.760> click<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:30.120> generate<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.590> will<00:02:31.830> take

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
and click on generate now this will take

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.670 
and click on generate now this will take
a<00:02:32.310> few<00:02:32.730> moments<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.390> run<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
a few moments to run and then once it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
a few moments to run and then once it
has<00:02:34.890> been<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.280> run<00:02:35.490> you'll<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.090> there's<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
like this lots of HTML or XML on your

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.530 
like this lots of HTML or XML on your
screen<00:02:47.580> now<00:02:47.820> we<00:02:48.360> are<00:02:48.750> actually<00:02:49.080> using<00:02:49.710> ours<00:02:50.540> as

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
screen now we are actually using ours as

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.950 
screen now we are actually using ours as
a<00:02:51.600> demo<00:02:52.140> system<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.460> so<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.810> would

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
a demo system like so so what we would

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.690 
a demo system like so so what we would
in<00:02:55.230> your<00:02:55.560> case<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.100> would<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.250> actually<00:02:56.520> quite

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
in your case it would be actually quite

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.160 
in your case it would be actually quite
different<00:02:56.910> when<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.360> need<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.570> know<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
different when you need to know is the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.430 
different when you need to know is the
sitemap<00:02:58.680> XML<00:02:59.070> file<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.660> jump<00:03:00.870> across<00:03:01.140> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
sitemap XML file so if I jump across to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.310 
sitemap XML file so if I jump across to
webmaster<00:03:02.190> tools<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:04.110> been<00:03:04.260> a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
blurred out some information on this

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.820 
blurred out some information on this
page<00:03:06.060> because<00:03:06.780> it's<00:03:06.930> kind<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> personal<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.800> us

actually<00:03:10.740> let<00:03:11.070> me<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.340> explain<00:03:11.670> where<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
actually let me just explain where you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.880 
actually let me just explain where you
need<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.210> go<00:03:12.390> which<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.840> need<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.170> go<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> crawl

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
need to go which you need to go to crawl

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.640 
need to go which you need to go to crawl
and<00:03:14.160> then<00:03:14.670> sitemaps<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> top

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and then sitemaps and then in the top

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.140 
and then sitemaps and then in the top
right<00:03:16.890> hand<00:03:16.920> corner<00:03:17.130> there's<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.640> button<00:03:17.880> which

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
right hand corner there's a button which

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.140 
right hand corner there's a button which
says<00:03:18.180> add<00:03:18.510> test<00:03:19.380> sitemap<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:20.940> where

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
says add test sitemap and that's where

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.140 
says add test sitemap and that's where
you<00:03:21.270> would<00:03:21.450> put<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.530> sitemap<00:03:22.860> XML<00:03:23.430> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you would put in the sitemap XML and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.080 
you would put in the sitemap XML and
then<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.020> click<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.260> either<00:03:25.860> test<00:03:26.340> sitemap

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
then go and click on either test sitemap

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000 
then go and click on either test sitemap
and<00:03:27.600> again<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.960> we<00:03:28.080> do<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.470> ours<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.890> it's

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and again if we do it on ours then it's

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.950 
and again if we do it on ours then it's
gonna<00:03:29.160> fail<00:03:29.490> but<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.180> your<00:03:30.300> case<00:03:30.510> if<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.780> just

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
gonna fail but in your case if you just

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.560 
gonna fail but in your case if you just
choose<00:03:31.200> tests<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.740> test<00:03:32.220> sitemap<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.090> you'll

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
choose tests a test sitemap and you'll

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.180 
choose tests a test sitemap and you'll
get<00:03:33.810> confirmation<00:03:34.230> whenever<00:03:34.710> it's<00:03:34.800> working

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
get confirmation whenever it's working

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.710 
get confirmation whenever it's working
