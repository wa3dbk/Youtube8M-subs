point<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.700> thought<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> same<00:00:48.239> thing

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
point I thought the same thing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
point I thought the same thing
I<00:00:48.719> thought<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> same<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:50.010> too<00:00:50.280> until

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

I did a little bit more reading and I
saw<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.480> reason<00:00:54.870> why<00:00:55.129> it<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> actually

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
saw that the reason why it can actually

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
saw that the reason why it can actually
add<00:00:56.730> moisture<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.270> shine<00:00:57.300> appears<00:00:57.809> actually

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
using this particular flutter also for

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.099 
using this particular flutter also for
the<00:03:54.700> steam<00:03:55.000> portion<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.480> forgot<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.930> mention

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109

the steam portion I forgot to mention
there's<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.829> button<00:03:57.099> for<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.880> steam<00:03:58.090> right

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
there's a button for the steam right

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.170 
there's a button for the steam right
hand<00:03:58.480> side<00:03:59.040> off<00:04:00.040> her<00:04:00.730> steam<00:04:00.970> off<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:03.180> this

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
hand side off her steam off and this

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.699 
hand side off her steam off and this
little<00:04:04.450> button<00:04:04.630> here<00:04:04.720> pops<00:04:05.049> out<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> little<00:04:05.410> bit

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
little button here pops out a little bit

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.240 
little button here pops out a little bit
if<00:04:05.889> it's<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.099> little<00:04:06.340> bit<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.519> steam<00:04:06.760> and

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
if it's a little bit of steam and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.830 
if it's a little bit of steam and
it's<00:04:07.430> more<00:04:07.640> sealant<00:04:08.000> comes<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.510> way<00:04:08.630> up

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it's more sealant comes all the way up

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.350 
it's more sealant comes all the way up
so<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.740> very<00:04:09.980> simple<00:04:10.190> flutter<00:04:10.520> it<00:04:11.210> also

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
so it's a very simple flutter it also

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.120 
so it's a very simple flutter it also
has<00:04:11.660> these<00:04:11.780> really<00:04:11.960> cool<00:04:12.320> ridges<00:04:12.710> right<00:04:12.890> here
