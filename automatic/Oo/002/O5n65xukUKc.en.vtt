00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.910
 steve kovalainen singing late at

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.070
 5 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.110
 this is a step that I think it 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.910
 39-point crowd that handled instinct 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.700
 who I 'm going to explain to you too 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.400
 why I allowed a stack 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.739
 what is it doing here chaps that's 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.739
 pages of a book 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:12.269

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:17.720

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.720
 iphone that we bought pop since 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.450
 it's theirs too much to nothing so 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:29.250
 So here in our reform here 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:33.240
 big enough it's pretty from the room 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:39.979
 heze the room of little bones and and if I 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.720
 I do not know if that what a lot 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.080
 see there excuse me I bugged so 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.729
 So here we go again at the mbba 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.860
 here is the news is the new iphone 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.460
 strong sun right away is really 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:59.010
 beautiful a little so that's a 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.720
 inside so that may be the 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:07.169
 mÃ¢chon no that's not what's happened 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:10.440
 there I have you very round if the chc the 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.460
 room tannes he has already started I 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.160
 I'm not sure if he put the holes in them 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.000
 bodies have not yet all she has 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.470
 started well 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.950
 yeah I think that changes the game 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.430
 and a350 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.430
 so after 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.039
 here my room that I'm going to do but 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:36.500
 vip and that are useless here is with 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:41.870
 a 1st floor 1 of Vienna 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.570
 the third is a small passage here 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.910
 of a wonderful room that the pop had 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.060
 did not do what he was pissed off 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.430
 so here's that lag a little bit in 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.060
 the bottom since it's big enough and 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.850
 a lot of things obsidian and water 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.240
 all around the base so that's enough 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.280
 hard 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.660
 so when I eat I respect it 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.479
 who gets to get into the base because 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.340
 it's so heavy that it is also 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.639
 this is the next iphone is not 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.430
 still decided I can not make a movie 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.780
 bitter as so that's the 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.860
 room delineations that I'm going 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.010
 actually do I'm going to do that 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.130
 rooms everywhere down here in 3d room 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.310
 also his words we will fart everything we go 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.539
 make rooms 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.060
 in all they told me that they had 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:32.240
 took three doubler trunk three 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.810
 double string hall 6 so there another 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:42.280
 bedroom 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:42.280
 good I have peace you must be here 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.099

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.520
 and here you are, that's it 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:54.770
 so that's it so I think we're done 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.900
 for the first part games street I believe 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.080
 that I forgot my name it's good I 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.550
 so think so so here we go 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.880
 found immediately for the second 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.880
 part
