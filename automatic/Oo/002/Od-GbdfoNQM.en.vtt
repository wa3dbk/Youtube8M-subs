00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 all right 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.519
 hi friends from the tony garden 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.379
 welcome to a video more where yes 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.820
 you remember a couple of weeks ago we did 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.679
 the seed of lettuce if you do not 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.360
 I will leave a link here to the video so that 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.130
 you can see it, they have grown 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.289
 enough for us to do the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.970
 repicado it would be the previous step 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.949
 to put them in the garden or in the aceto 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.779
 garden for this we are going to use what 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.269
 same as in the seedbed the substrate 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.090
 mixed with earthworm humus and we're going 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.250
 to transplant these yogurts or glasses of 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.460
 recycled coffee we can also use a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.440
 seedbed as one bought is really 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.089
 use for it we will use this 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.799
 tool so hard to find 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.510
 as it is a small fork is 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.070
 interesting that it's a fork for 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.159
 try to harm as little as possible 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.559
 roots so we insert the fork what 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.629
 as deep as possible to one more centimeter 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.330
 or less of the lettuce we want to take out 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.250
 and then exerting a little bit of pressure 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.770
 let's try to get it out with all the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.460
 roots that we can well 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.320
 so perfect let's get the lettuces 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 with all the possible roots in this 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.180
 consists of the replicated in passing of a 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.530
 seedbed where we have all the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.110
 lettuces together to a 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 we put it here and it would be individual to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.780
 that she can grow a lot better 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 we remove the rinse or it consists in removing 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.900
 the smallest are the weakest that 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.210
 it serves us for nothing how are you here 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.720
 that are very small and do not serve us 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.399
 we took them off and now we're going to 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.399
 try to get this with all its root 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.680
 OK 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.750
 now in the yogurt or in the coffee glass 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.369
 that we already have prepared we make a 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.159
 hole roughly the thickness of the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.970
 root so that we get well and the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.300
 we insert 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.820
 so covering up 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.090
 where the cotyledons appear we press 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.090
 all right 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.500
 and I had a transplanted lettuce 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.780
 to prepare our seedbed 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.450
 recycled from a single we take a 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.550
 yogurt we make three holes so that the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 water drain well and do not cover us 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.040
 estate 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.840
 then fill with the mixture that already 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.280
 we have prepared that we saw in the video 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.290
 of lettuce seed that would be 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.989
 we fill in the same 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.940
 we won a little we tightened a tad 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.980
 you just do not have to squeeze much 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 fill up and now with the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.060
 fork through the back we make the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.590
 hole where we're going to put the lettuce and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.670
 Now we do the same operation all the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.230
 until we finish with the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.730
 seedling let's do it from another 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 angle so you can see how simple it is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.010
 the only thing is to put the fork with much 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.510
 careful not to damage the roots is worth a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.570
 centimeter more or less of the lettuce 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.390
 insert well the fork is worth and 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.950
 we take it up so it's better 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 used in having some spoon because 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.660
 the roots would pass in the middle of the barbs 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.990
 of the fork and so it's much simpler 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.700
 that we do not break the root 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.170
 and in this is replicated 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.600
 we would really move from a seedbed 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.130
 common to an individual nursery where 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.740
 the little plants are going to develop 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.720
 much better you see how easy here 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.830
 you realize that I brought one besides this 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.280
 it is very small it is very little 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.709
 developed we removed it out 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 is the thinning now very carefully 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.280
 let's insert the roots and this part 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.410
 of the trunk we will also put it 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 inside the earth until what would be 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.690
 the cotyledons of the lettuce we insert 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.230
 well all the trunk and we are covering 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.480
 so we press well that we stay straight and 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.250
 we already have another lettuce transplanted already 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.069
 we have transplanted most of them 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.720
 we have put 8 here 7 here and this 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.160
 seedbed which is normally where 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.510
 they sell us the lettuces that also 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 has made for you to see that also 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.810
 It can be done although I like them 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.870
 less because they retain less moisture 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.459
 have less soil or less substrate than 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.050
 these dry up much earlier and there 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.030
 that to keep watching the most I prefer 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.040
 use these that are also recycled 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.709
 ok we have stayed these for the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.720
 and here we coming back week 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.610
 another hotbed of lettuce you know that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
 the lettuces and always stepwise 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.540
 much better to not have all the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.770
 hit lettuces and only us 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.900
 I would apply a good irrigation 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.720
 with this homemade watering can we have and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.000
 We water them all to make him feel good 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.400
 the land and the plant suffer the least 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.620
 possible in the transplant so we go 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.780
 watering them all with great care of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.880
 do not damage the leaves we water with the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.320
 Homemade gift that we made so that the 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.270
 we mixed with a little humus of 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.130
 liquid worm that we have already done and that 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.540
 you have seen in other videos you have already 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.280
 seen how easy it is to do the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.290
 clarified and the transplant of our 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 lettuce in these following videos that 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.400
 I leave you here below we will see how 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.530
 transplant them to their final site in 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.180
 the garden or in the urban garden I hope 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.710
 that you liked it if you gave it to him 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 to me like you can comment me what 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.370
 you want and subscribe to the channel if you do not 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.990
 you are subscribed that here always 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.360
 we put interesting videos on the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.990
 plants and on orchards good until 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.990
 next video
