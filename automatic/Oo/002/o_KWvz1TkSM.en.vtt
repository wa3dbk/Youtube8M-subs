in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.410> tutorial<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:02.250> will<00:00:02.340> explore<00:00:02.730> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
in this tutorial we will explore the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.030 
in this tutorial we will explore the
process<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.419> making<00:00:03.720> ice<00:00:03.840> cream<00:00:04.080> you<00:00:04.950> will

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
