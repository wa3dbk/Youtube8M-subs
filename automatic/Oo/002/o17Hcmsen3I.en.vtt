a front-wheel drive car with low power

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
a front-wheel drive car with low power
the<00:00:32.489> answer<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.969> our<00:00:33.750> left<00:00:34.500> foot<00:00:34.649> braking

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the answer is our left foot braking

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
the answer is our left foot braking
technique<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> their<00:00:35.940> way<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.270> train<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:37.620> mean

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
technique and their way we train we mean

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.349 
technique and their way we train we mean
a<00:00:37.949> front-wheel<00:00:38.550> drive<00:00:38.579> vehicle<00:00:38.820> that's

front-wheel drive vehicle after we've
done<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.789> for<00:01:30.920> probably<00:01:31.920> most<00:01:32.219> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> day

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
done that for probably most of the day

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179
