00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.800
 I wonder who will stop 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.800
 next 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.840
 friends now have '' Gurt '' next to charmie 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.560
 let's see what gurt macla 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.500
 now we're crossing over there 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.580
 hello to everyone again we saw an incredible mac 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 I have theokoles next to me 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.860
 what do you want to say about your performance 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.320
 it didn't look like a good beginning, but things changed a lot. 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.351
 beautiful movements especially in your forest 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.520
 then the raids that you brought changed things a lot 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.653
 The moment our middle hallway was weak due to some pickups 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.740
 so our early was weak but we were strong in the late 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.775
 I couldn't help with that because jarvan was picking up. 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.460
 I preferred to help him instead of boat lanede kalamim 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.220
 the game was easier for us 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.760
 well what we say about the performance of the stay 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360
 the only thing really was a negative champion towards the end of the game 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.780
 And you saved her from front many times. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.720
 What about the performance of the player? 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 I think the best names in the current carry him in my power to protect her turkey 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.900
 I do everything for her in the #feda team game 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.460
 well we saw you in a big part of the upper hall 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.000
 especially in the first stages you were there in thirty seconds 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.560
 What did you do that was a tactic? 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.240
 I'm going to the upper hallway by evaluating them. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.180
 I didn't have a flash, so I didn't have a five-dakka flash. 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 my question is very good, I will show you a very good perfonmasn showed rengarla 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.940
 After that, what champions can you expect from us? 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.180
 I'd like to play jarvan and I'd like to play rengar 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.960
 I've just played rek sai you can see the correction =) 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.740
 I would like to say goodbye to your friends after a very, very nice thank you very much. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.480
 What do you think the cradle of power is, and what is unbearable? you do not look very weak, but =) what do you want to say? 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 Our strong side is close to nothing but in the game with very little time to recover in the game and close the pain of the game again, we can return to the game. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:34.600
 Our biggest plus is that we do too much training in all of us six six hours in the game we play all the time, we are constantly developing ourselves, we are keeping up with the commodities 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.200
 we follow the games of the european lcs when everything is controlled by one side of the results. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.680
 we say that we work with this success 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.220

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.800
