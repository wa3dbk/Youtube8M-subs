first look and I'm just going to add it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
first look and I'm just going to add it
to<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> crease<00:00:28.830> she's<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to the crease she's just got in this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
to the crease she's just got in this
second<00:00:31.109> look<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.550> color

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
second look just a little bit more color

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.900 
second look just a little bit more color
so<00:00:33.140> just<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.770> end<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> end<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.730> all

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
so just right from end to end just all

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
so just right from end to end just all
along<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> crease<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.230> wing<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> out

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
along the crease and you can wing it out

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.290 
along the crease and you can wing it out
there<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.000> little<00:00:39.239> bit

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.390 

and<00:00:46.810> now<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:47.110> think<00:00:47.380> one<00:00:47.530> of<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.770> things<00:00:48.070> that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
and now I think one of the things that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.930 
and now I think one of the things that
stands<00:00:48.820> out<00:00:49.060> for<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.420> look<00:00:49.810> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
stands out for this look and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.370 
stands out for this look and
differentiates<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.180> from<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.570> other<00:00:52.750> look<00:00:53.110> is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
differentiates it from the other look is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.220 
differentiates it from the other look is
this<00:00:53.970> goal<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.989> she<00:00:56.230> has<00:00:56.410> under<00:00:56.830> her<00:00:57.010> eyes

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this goal that she has under her eyes

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.420 
this goal that she has under her eyes
along<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.739> lash<00:01:00.040> line<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:02.500> using<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
along the lash line and I'm using a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.180 
along the lash line and I'm using a
mineral<00:01:04.650> eyeshadow<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.479> by<00:01:08.190> mineral

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
mineral eyeshadow this is by mineral

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.340 
mineral eyeshadow this is by mineral
magic

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.610 

so<00:01:14.830> now<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.400> biggest<00:01:15.790> part<00:01:16.330> about<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.140> look

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
so now the biggest part about this look

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.720 
so now the biggest part about this look
to<00:01:17.950> change<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.460> from<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.790> other<00:01:18.910> look<00:01:19.240> is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
to change it from the other look is

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.670 
to change it from the other look is
using<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:22.030> turquoise<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.800> waterline<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
using a turquoise on the waterline and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.830 
using a turquoise on the waterline and
I'm<00:01:26.680> using<00:01:27.220> one<00:01:27.550> called<00:01:27.820> pop<00:01:28.120> Patrol<00:01:28.570> by

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
I found a pretty close match to the lip

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.809 
I found a pretty close match to the lip
