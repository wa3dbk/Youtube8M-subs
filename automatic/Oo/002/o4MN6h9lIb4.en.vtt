00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.369 

a<00:00:05.150> lot<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.180> people<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.629> are<00:00:06.750> getting<00:00:06.839> started

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
a lot of people that are getting started

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.049 
a lot of people that are getting started
and<00:00:07.500> cycling<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.069> too<00:00:08.250> short<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.730> difference

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
and cycling are too short the difference

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
and cycling are too short the difference
between<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.690> mountain<00:00:09.960> bike<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.769> road<00:00:10.950> bike

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
between a mountain bike and a road bike

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.980 
between a mountain bike and a road bike
is<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:12.120> just<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> go<00:00:12.599> through<00:00:12.630> some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
is so I'm just going to go through some

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.070 
is so I'm just going to go through some
things<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.410> tell<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> those<00:00:14.190> differences

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
things and tell you those differences

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
things and tell you those differences
okay<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> left<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
okay so on the left here we have the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480 
okay so on the left here we have the
road<00:00:17.699> bike<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.660> right<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
road bike and on the right we have a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
road bike and on the right we have a
mountain<00:00:21.029> bike<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:24.019> usually<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> mountain<00:00:25.500> bike

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
mountain bike so usually a mountain bike

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.500 
mountain bike so usually a mountain bike
will<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> much<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.519> aggressive<00:00:26.820> frame

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
will have a much more aggressive frame

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.099 
will have a much more aggressive frame
so<00:00:27.779> sharper<00:00:29.210> sharp<00:00:30.210> angles<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> things<00:00:30.990> like

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so sharper sharp angles and things like

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
so sharper sharp angles and things like
that<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.679> mailbox<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.279> different<00:00:32.550> story

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that this mailbox is different story

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
that this mailbox is different story
this<00:00:32.940> mountain<00:00:33.239> bike<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.450> pretty<00:00:33.570> relaxed

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this mountain bike is pretty relaxed

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
this mountain bike is pretty relaxed
pretty<00:00:34.920> relaxed<00:00:35.280> geometry<00:00:35.870> reason<00:00:36.870> being<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pretty relaxed geometry reason being is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
pretty relaxed geometry reason being is
I<00:00:37.320> bought<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I bought it at the time to do a bit of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.400 
I bought it at the time to do a bit of
mountain<00:00:39.000> biking<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.540> road<00:00:39.809> riding<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
mountain biking and road riding so it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
mountain biking and road riding so it
was<00:00:40.500> still<00:00:40.710> comfortable<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.430> both<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
was still comfortable to do both as you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
was still comfortable to do both as you
can<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> road<00:00:43.739> bike<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.309> top<00:00:44.670> tube

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
can see with the road bike the top tube

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.150 
can see with the road bike the top tube
is<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.030> flat<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.230> geometry<00:00:46.469> isn't

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is very flat and the geometry isn't

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
is very flat and the geometry isn't
anywhere<00:00:47.550> near<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.850> aggressive<00:00:48.329> every<00:00:49.230> bikes

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
anywhere near as aggressive every bikes

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.690 
anywhere near as aggressive every bikes
different<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> general

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
different but that's just the general

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.100 
different but that's just the general
consist<00:00:51.539> consensus<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> probably

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
consist consensus of the two so probably

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
consist consensus of the two so probably
the<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> note<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> mountain

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the first thing to note is a mountain

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
the first thing to note is a mountain
bike<00:00:56.579> usually<00:00:57.000> has<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.510> suspension<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bike usually has a suspension so this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
bike usually has a suspension so this
here<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> suspension<00:00:59.489> fork<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.930> goes<00:01:01.140> up

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
here is the suspension fork that goes up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.540 
here is the suspension fork that goes up
and<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> hit<00:01:02.010> bumps<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> things

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and down when you hit bumps and things

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.789 
and down when you hit bumps and things
like<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.989> whereas<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> road<00:01:04.290> bike<00:01:04.500> has<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like that whereas the road bike has a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.750 
like that whereas the road bike has a
solid<00:01:05.869> solid<00:01:06.869> fork<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.470> no<00:01:07.619> suspension<00:01:08.250> at

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
solid solid fork with no suspension at

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.230 
solid solid fork with no suspension at
all<00:01:09.470> suspension<00:01:10.470> does<00:01:10.650> take<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> lot<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.909> effort

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
all suspension does take a lot of effort

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300 
all suspension does take a lot of effort
away<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.770> pedaling<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
away from you so as you're pedaling it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.890 
away from you so as you're pedaling it
the<00:01:14.610> front<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.000> bounce<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.750> that's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the front will bounce around so that's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.469 
the front will bounce around so that's
why<00:01:16.080> road<00:01:16.350> bike<00:01:16.670> that's<00:01:17.670> built<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:17.970> speed<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
why road bike that's built for speed and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.760 
why road bike that's built for speed and
climbing<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.049> things<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> doesn't

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
climbing and things like that doesn't

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
climbing and things like that doesn't
have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> suspension<00:01:20.610> fork<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.750> mountain

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
have a suspension fork some mountain

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
have a suspension fork some mountain
bikes<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.409> rear<00:01:22.619> suspension<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.549> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
bikes have rear suspension as well this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
bikes have rear suspension as well this
one<00:01:24.570> doesn't<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> hardtail<00:01:25.650> meaning

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
one doesn't this is a hardtail meaning

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
one doesn't this is a hardtail meaning
the<00:01:26.549> RIA<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.000> no<00:01:27.270> suspension

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the RIA has no suspension

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
the RIA has no suspension
another<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.790> usually<00:01:29.939> mountain<00:01:30.390> bikes

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
another thing is usually mountain bikes

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
another thing is usually mountain bikes
have<00:01:30.810> flat<00:01:31.170> bars<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.680> bars<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have flat bars so bars that just go

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960 
have flat bars so bars that just go
straight<00:01:32.640> across<00:01:33.229> with<00:01:34.229> levers<00:01:34.680> brake<00:01:35.549> levers

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
straight across with levers brake levers

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
straight across with levers brake levers
like<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.350> shifters<00:01:37.770> around<00:01:38.400> the

like this and the shifters around the
same<00:01:38.670> area<00:01:39.049> road<00:01:40.049> bike<00:01:40.259> usually<00:01:40.860> has<00:01:41.070> these

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
same area road bike usually has these

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
same area road bike usually has these
drop<00:01:42.030> bars<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.930> always<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> flat

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
drop bars not always you can get a flat

bar road bike the usual case road bike
will<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.850> drop<00:01:48.180> bars<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> come

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
will have these drop bars that come

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
will have these drop bars that come
around<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> hoards<00:01:50.070> woods

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
around like this with the hoards woods

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
around like this with the hoards woods
here<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.880> you've<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.329> levers<00:01:51.720> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
aluminium road bike so yeah road bikes

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.680 
aluminium road bike so yeah road bikes
usually<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.740> lot<00:02:23.920> lighter<00:02:24.190> which<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.510> tell

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
usually a lot lighter which I can tell

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.360 
usually a lot lighter which I can tell
when<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.900> definitely<00:02:26.290> pick<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:26.920> bikes<00:02:27.220> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
when I definitely pick up these bikes I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.040 
when I definitely pick up these bikes I
think<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.610> mountain<00:02:27.850> bike<00:02:27.970> weighs<00:02:28.180> double<00:02:28.900> if

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
think the mountain bike weighs double if

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.440 
think the mountain bike weighs double if
not<00:02:29.080> more<00:02:29.470> than<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.890> road<00:02:30.070> block<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:31.360> yeah

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
not more than the road block but yeah

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.040 
not more than the road block but yeah
road<00:02:31.660> bikes<00:02:31.870> built<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.350> very<00:02:32.380> stiff<00:02:32.860> so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
road bikes built to be very stiff so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
road bikes built to be very stiff so
they<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.820> when<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.910> exhilarate<00:02:37.360> they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
they do when you exhilarate they

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
they do when you exhilarate they
actually<00:02:37.780> move<00:02:38.020> clearly<00:02:38.980> quickly<00:02:39.340> whereas<00:02:39.610> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
actually move clearly quickly whereas a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.760 
actually move clearly quickly whereas a
mountain<00:02:39.970> bikes<00:02:40.150> built<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.540> absorb<00:02:40.709> some<00:02:41.709> of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
mountain bikes built to absorb some of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.170 
mountain bikes built to absorb some of
the<00:02:41.920> bumps<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.370> jumps<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.820> things<00:02:43.030> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the bumps and jumps and things that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.260 
the bumps and jumps and things that
you'll<00:02:43.270> be<00:02:43.330> doing<00:02:44.700> don't<00:02:45.700> mind<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.060> seat

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
you'll be doing don't mind my seat

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.729 
you'll be doing don't mind my seat
that's<00:02:46.450> not<00:02:46.630> normally<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.080> low<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.560> just

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
that's not normally that low it's just

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.680 
that's not normally that low it's just
someone<00:02:48.160> else<00:02:48.310> ride<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.640> bike<00:02:48.820> for<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.510> bit<00:02:49.630> of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
someone else ride the bike for a bit of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.290 
someone else ride the bike for a bit of
fun<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:51.400> lot<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.580> man<00:02:51.760> bikes<00:02:52.000> these<00:02:52.239> days

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
fun so a lot of man bikes these days

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.449 
fun so a lot of man bikes these days
will<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.690> described<00:02:53.290> disc<00:02:53.590> brakes<00:02:53.860> as<00:02:54.220> you

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
will have described disc brakes as you

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.300 
will have described disc brakes as you
can<00:02:54.610> see<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.239> disc<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.830> front<00:02:57.250> and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
can see there the disc and front and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.760 
can see there the disc and front and
rear<00:02:57.400> some<00:02:58.030> still<00:02:58.300> don't<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:58.750> that's<00:02:58.930> general

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
rear some still don't but that's general

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.160 
rear some still don't but that's general
concept<00:03:00.160> consensus<00:03:00.910> again<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.750> most

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
concept consensus again is that most

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.750 
concept consensus again is that most
mountain<00:03:02.500> box<00:03:02.680> will<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.010> disc<00:03:03.220> brakes<00:03:03.489> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
mountain box will have disc brakes and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.540 
mountain box will have disc brakes and
most<00:03:04.720> road<00:03:04.930> bikes<00:03:05.200> will<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.590> these<00:03:06.190> Connor

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
most road bikes will have these Connor

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.840 
most road bikes will have these Connor
you<00:03:06.790> brakes<00:03:07.170> cantilever<00:03:08.170> style<00:03:08.470> brakes<00:03:09.400> front

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.710 
you brakes cantilever style brakes front
and<00:03:10.000> rear<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:12.120> some<00:03:13.120> road<00:03:13.300> bikes<00:03:13.510> these<00:03:13.660> days

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
and rear but some road bikes these days

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.590 
and rear but some road bikes these days
are<00:03:14.080> coming<00:03:14.200> out<00:03:14.500> with<00:03:14.650> disc<00:03:14.890> brakes<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.610> it's

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
are coming out with disc brakes so it's

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.199 
are coming out with disc brakes so it's
not<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.980> not<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> be-all<00:03:18.400> end-all<00:03:18.700> model

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
not it's not the be-all end-all model

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.759 
not it's not the be-all end-all model
road<00:03:19.390> bikes<00:03:19.630> have<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.989> brakes<00:03:20.230> some<00:03:20.560> have

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
road bikes have you brakes some have

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.039 
road bikes have you brakes some have
this<00:03:21.430> brakes<00:03:21.730> now<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.120> well<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:22.870> there's

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
this brakes now as well and then there's

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.360 
this brakes now as well and then there's
a<00:03:23.110> bikes<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.650> are<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:23.830> between<00:03:24.160> which<00:03:24.340> is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
a bikes that are in between which is

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.940 
a bikes that are in between which is
cyclocross<00:03:25.000> bikes<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.720> they're<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.170> bit<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.830> a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
cyclocross bikes so they're a bit of a

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.050 
cyclocross bikes so they're a bit of a
road<00:03:27.910> bike<00:03:28.120> frame<00:03:28.420> almost<00:03:28.660> but<00:03:29.200> with<00:03:29.470> them<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
road bike frame almost but with them and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.160 
road bike frame almost but with them and
handlebars<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.299> they'll<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.630> disc<00:03:31.900> brakes

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
handlebars but they'll have disc brakes

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.960 
handlebars but they'll have disc brakes
and<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.680> few<00:03:33.250> other<00:03:33.340> little<00:03:33.519> different

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and a few other little different

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.850 
and a few other little different
different<00:03:34.630> features<00:03:36.000> another<00:03:37.000> thing<00:03:37.360> is

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
different features another thing is

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.610

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.960 
thing whereas a mountain bike here you
can<00:03:50.290> see<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> ties<00:03:50.769> much<00:03:51.160> wider<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.700> it's

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
can see the ties much wider and it's

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.680 
can see the ties much wider and it's
covered<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.680> absolutely<00:03:53.680> covered<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.690> covered

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
covered in absolutely covered in covered

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.150 
covered in absolutely covered in covered
in<00:03:55.810> tread<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.290> that's<00:03:56.500> obviously<00:03:56.620> for<00:03:56.860> grip

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
in tread so that's obviously for grip

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.729 
in tread so that's obviously for grip
and<00:03:58.120> stuff<00:03:58.329> like<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.690> whereas<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> road<00:03:59.500> bikes

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
and stuff like that whereas a road bikes

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.050 
and stuff like that whereas a road bikes
primary<00:04:00.130> surfaces<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.670> go<00:04:01.600> fast<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.230> be

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
primary surfaces just go fast and be

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.630 
primary surfaces just go fast and be
efficient<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.600> road

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
efficient on the road

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.880 
efficient on the road
so<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.240> think<00:04:07.300> that's<00:04:07.570> roughly<00:04:07.900> roughly<00:04:08.650> all

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
so I think that's roughly roughly all

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.100 
so I think that's roughly roughly all
the<00:04:09.040> differences<00:04:09.460> between<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.970> both<00:04:10.120> bikes<00:04:10.420> I

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
the differences between the both bikes I

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.350 
the differences between the both bikes I
know<00:04:11.950> when<00:04:12.160> I<00:04:12.190> started<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.910> mountain<00:04:13.210> bike

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
know when I started the mountain bike

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.360 
know when I started the mountain bike
because<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.350> could<00:04:14.500> ride<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.890> road<00:04:15.070> and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
because I could ride on the road and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.750 
because I could ride on the road and
ride<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:16.720> trails<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.350> stuff<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.920> but

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
ride on trails and stuff like that but

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.190 
ride on trails and stuff like that but
there<00:04:18.850> were<00:04:18.940> times<00:04:19.090> when<00:04:19.420> I<00:04:19.450> thought<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:19.780> really

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
there were times when I thought I really

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.930 
there were times when I thought I really
wish<00:04:20.350> there<00:04:20.709> was<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.070> way<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.310> could<00:04:21.400> convert

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
wish there was a way I could convert

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.690 
wish there was a way I could convert
this<00:04:22.150> almost<00:04:22.480> into<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> road<00:04:23.050> bike<00:04:23.290> but<00:04:24.160> there's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
this almost into a road bike but there's

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.430 
this almost into a road bike but there's
too<00:04:24.850> many<00:04:24.970> things<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.450> do<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.900> convert<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.230> tool

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
too many things to do to convert a tool

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.830 
too many things to do to convert a tool
road<00:04:26.680> bike<00:04:26.890> or<00:04:27.490> not<00:04:28.150> convert<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.690> road

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
road bike or not convert it to a road

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.060 
road bike or not convert it to a road
bike<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.170> when<00:04:29.290> ever<00:04:29.440> rode<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> road<00:04:30.040> I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
bike but when ever rode on the road I

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.280 
bike but when ever rode on the road I
wanted<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.610> make<00:04:31.390> some<00:04:31.570> changes<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.960> make<00:04:32.140> it

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
wanted to make some changes to make it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.460 
wanted to make some changes to make it
easier<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:34.300> only<00:04:34.510> thing<00:04:34.690> that's<00:04:34.930> easy<00:04:35.260> that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
easier the only thing that's easy that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.690 
easier the only thing that's easy that
you<00:04:35.530> can<00:04:35.650> really<00:04:35.830> do<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.160> get<00:04:36.520> some

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
you can really do is just get some

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.970 
you can really do is just get some
really<00:04:36.940> narrow<00:04:37.180> really<00:04:38.140> narrow<00:04:38.350> tires<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:38.920> you

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
really narrow really narrow tires so you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.350 
really narrow really narrow tires so you
can<00:04:39.100> get<00:04:39.250> road<00:04:39.460> tires<00:04:39.730> for<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.090> mountain<00:04:40.300> bike

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
can get road tires for a mountain bike

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.510 
can get road tires for a mountain bike
if<00:04:40.600> they<00:04:40.750> fit<00:04:40.960> your<00:04:41.110> rim<00:04:41.350> or<00:04:41.650> cyclocross<00:04:42.160> tires

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
if they fit your rim or cyclocross tires

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.210 
if they fit your rim or cyclocross tires
and<00:04:43.080> that's<00:04:44.080> probably<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.440> only<00:04:44.770> big<00:04:45.010> help

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
and that's probably the only big help

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.920 
and that's probably the only big help
you<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.490> get<00:04:45.730> you<00:04:46.150> don't<00:04:46.300> elite<00:04:46.540> changing

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
you can get you don't elite changing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.390 
you can get you don't elite changing
cassettes<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.530> gears<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.950> all<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.220> stuff

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
cassettes and gears and all that stuff

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.820 
cassettes and gears and all that stuff
every<00:04:48.700> time<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.060> ride<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.830> changing

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
every time you ride and changing

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.680 
every time you ride and changing
handlebars<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.700> putting<00:04:52.120> handlebars<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.660> a

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
handlebars and putting handlebars on a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.390 
handlebars and putting handlebars on a
mountain<00:04:52.990> bikes<00:04:53.170> just<00:04:53.440> just<00:04:53.740> way<00:04:54.100> too<00:04:54.160> much

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
mountain bikes just just way too much

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.780 
mountain bikes just just way too much
work<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.320> best<00:04:56.320> options<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.890> buy<00:04:57.190> both<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.760> you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
work so best options to buy both if you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.630 
work so best options to buy both if you
can<00:04:58.060> afford<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.420> do<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:59.020> not<00:04:59.370> like<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> said

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
can afford to do so if not like I said

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.010 
can afford to do so if not like I said
by<00:05:00.820> mountain<00:05:01.120> bikers<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.690> write<00:05:01.840> it

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
by mountain bikers you can write it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.130 
by mountain bikers you can write it
anywhere<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:03.310> put<00:05:03.640> some<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:04.840> swap<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
anywhere and just put some just swap the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.330 
anywhere and just put some just swap the
tires<00:05:05.350> out<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:05.800> if<00:05:05.860> you've<00:05:05.950> got<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.070> mountain

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
tires out so if you've got a mountain

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.040 
tires out so if you've got a mountain
bike<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.490> put<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.880> put<00:05:07.180> your<00:05:07.330> wide<00:05:07.510> nabis<00:05:07.900> on

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
bike and put you put your wide nabis on

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.810 
bike and put you put your wide nabis on
if<00:05:08.200> you're<00:05:08.320> going<00:05:08.590> road<00:05:08.980> riding<00:05:09.430> then<00:05:09.670> just

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
if you're going road riding then just

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.260 
if you're going road riding then just
put<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.120> your<00:05:10.860> cyclocross<00:05:11.860> or<00:05:12.130> road<00:05:12.820> narrow

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
put on your cyclocross or road narrow

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.810 
put on your cyclocross or road narrow
tires<00:05:13.630> because<00:05:14.560> most<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.160> resistance<00:05:15.430> is

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
tires because most of the resistance is

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.820 
tires because most of the resistance is
in<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.060> tires<00:05:16.300> not<00:05:17.290> much<00:05:17.440> you<00:05:17.560> can<00:05:17.680> do<00:05:17.770> about

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
in the tires not much you can do about

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.930 
in the tires not much you can do about
the<00:05:18.070> weight<00:05:18.220> if<00:05:18.430> you're<00:05:18.520> mountain<00:05:18.760> bikes

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the weight if you're mountain bikes

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.420 
the weight if you're mountain bikes
heavy<00:05:19.180> but<00:05:19.510> as<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:20.080> said<00:05:20.410> best<00:05:20.680> option<00:05:21.070> is<00:05:21.220> if

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
heavy but as I said best option is if

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.120 
heavy but as I said best option is if
you<00:05:21.520> can<00:05:21.700> afford<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:22.060> buy<00:05:22.510> both<00:05:22.780> bikes<00:05:23.080> one<00:05:23.950> for

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
you can afford to buy both bikes one for

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.970 
you can afford to buy both bikes one for
each<00:05:24.220> purpose<00:05:25.140> but<00:05:26.140> not<00:05:26.380> everyone<00:05:26.680> can<00:05:26.830> do

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
each purpose but not everyone can do

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.620 
each purpose but not everyone can do
that<00:05:27.130> so<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.610> always<00:05:27.910> recommend<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.450> if

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that so I always recommend that if

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.030
