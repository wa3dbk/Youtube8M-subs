reinforce the Victorian style which is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.360 
reinforce the Victorian style which is
the<00:02:46.220> year<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:47.150> these<00:02:48.370> automobiles

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the year that that these automobiles

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.780 
the year that that these automobiles
were<00:02:49.790> made<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.890> think<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.950> lot<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.310> objects

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
were made I think a lot of the objects

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.949 
were made I think a lot of the objects
that<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:52.970> found<00:02:53.180> were<00:02:53.300> actually<00:02:53.600> made<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that I found were actually made in the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.100 
that I found were actually made in the
1980s<00:02:54.800> though<00:02:55.150> because<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.360> think<00:02:56.420> brass<00:02:56.780> was

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
1980s though because I think brass was

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
1980s though because I think brass was
pretty<00:02:57.320> popular<00:02:57.590> then<00:02:58.100> there's<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.940> spittoon

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
pretty popular then there's a spittoon

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.250 
pretty popular then there's a spittoon
so<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.239> spit<00:03:02.600> while<00:03:02.900> you're<00:03:03.050> chewing

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
so you can spit while you're chewing

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.710 
so you can spit while you're chewing
tobacco<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:06.880> let's<00:03:07.880> see<00:03:08.090> we've<00:03:08.269> got<00:03:08.510> some

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
tobacco and let's see we've got some

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.970 
tobacco and let's see we've got some
horns<00:03:09.170> over<00:03:09.530> there<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:12.140> petals<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:12.799> have

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
horns over there and the petals we have

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
capitalism and so on and maybe that's

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.149

this<00:06:47.550> kind<00:06:47.969> of<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:49.650> evolution<00:06:50.310> is<00:06:50.460> is<00:06:51.060> maybe

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
this kind of the evolution is is maybe

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:56.719 
this kind of the evolution is is maybe
we<00:06:51.930> can<00:06:52.650> take<00:06:52.830> another<00:06:53.069> step<00:06:55.339> however<00:06:56.339> I<00:06:56.430> can't
