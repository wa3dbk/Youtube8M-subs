about<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> sizing<00:00:46.739> means<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> here's<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
about what the sizing means so here's a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.029 
about what the sizing means so here's a
fun<00:00:47.850> cool<00:00:48.149> super<00:00:48.600> giant<00:00:49.289> needle<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> not

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
fun cool super giant needle this is not

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.139 
fun cool super giant needle this is not
actually<00:00:50.309> fitting<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.550> sewing<00:00:50.820> machine<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
actually fitting your sewing machine I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
actually fitting your sewing machine I
wish<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> did<00:00:51.690> oh<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.949> you're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
wish it did oh and by the way if you're

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
watching Facebook and Instagram you saw

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.360 
watching Facebook and Instagram you saw
the<00:00:55.140> cool<00:00:55.379> wood<00:00:55.620> needles<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.129> were<00:00:56.219> out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the cool wood needles that were out

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
the cool wood needles that were out
there<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> tried<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> carve<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
there that I tried to carve for this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.880 
there that I tried to carve for this
shoot<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.350> let<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
shoot but they would let them on the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.430 
shoot but they would let them on the
airplane<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.820> strapped<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> wing<00:01:01.230> like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
airplane or strapped to the wing like

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
airplane or strapped to the wing like
missiles<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.980> guess<00:01:02.129> anyways<00:01:02.430> moving<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
missiles I guess anyways moving on so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.509 
missiles I guess anyways moving on so
here<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> needle<00:01:04.589> numbering<00:01:05.010> system<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
here is a needle numbering system and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.149 
here is a needle numbering system and
often<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.930> t12<00:01:07.710> 90<00:01:08.670> 14

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
often you're gonna see like a t12 90 14

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.039 
often you're gonna see like a t12 90 14
116<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
116 and what that really is is the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.830 
116 and what that really is is the
hundred<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.430> metric<00:01:14.790> system<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
hundred is the metric system and the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
hundred is the metric system and the
sixteen<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.590> US<00:01:16.920> standard<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.030> you're

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
sixteen is our US standard so you're

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
sixteen is our US standard so you're
always<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:19.080> those<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.650> sets<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
always going to see those two sets of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.850 
always going to see those two sets of
numbers<00:01:20.400> travel<00:01:20.850> together<00:01:21.000> 80<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> 1290<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
numbers travel together 80 and 1290 and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300 
numbers travel together 80 and 1290 and
14<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> bigger<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> numbers

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
14 and so on now the bigger the numbers

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
14 and so on now the bigger the numbers
the<00:01:26.759> bigger<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> needles<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.689> gonna<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the bigger the needles are gonna be the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
the bigger the needles are gonna be the
bigger<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> needle<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> bigger<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
bigger the needle the bigger the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
bigger the needle the bigger the
features<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.650> features<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
features and the features are kind of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
features and the features are kind of
like<00:01:33.060> flavors<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.350> let's<00:01:34.560> talk<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
like flavors so let's talk about some of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
like flavors so let's talk about some of
the<00:01:35.369> parts<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:35.909> needle<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the parts of our needle this is really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
the parts of our needle this is really
cool<00:01:36.840> stuff<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> wouldn't<00:01:38.100> believe

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
cool stuff actually you wouldn't believe

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.590 
cool stuff actually you wouldn't believe
how<00:01:38.369> much<00:01:38.460> engineering<00:01:38.970> goes<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.299> needles

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
how much engineering goes into needles

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
how much engineering goes into needles
you<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> front<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.189> called<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you have on the front what it's called a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
you have on the front what it's called a
kerf<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> curve<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> front<00:01:43.439> groove

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799

names of needles have to offer so let's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.000 
names of needles have to offer so let's
start<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.960> universal<00:02:29.620> needle<00:02:29.860> for

example a universal needle has kind of a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.100 
example a universal needle has kind of a
medium<00:02:32.890> sized<00:02:33.220> eye<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.360> eyes<00:02:34.540> come<00:02:34.900> into

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
medium sized eye and the eyes come into

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.890 
medium sized eye and the eyes come into
two<00:02:35.230> kinds<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.590> shapes<00:02:35.830> circles<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:37.090> big<00:02:37.570> long

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
two kinds of shapes circles or big long

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.370 
two kinds of shapes circles or big long
ovals<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.250> smaller<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.910> eye<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.570> more<00:02:40.930> wear

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
ovals the smaller the eye the more wear

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.230 
ovals the smaller the eye the more wear
and<00:02:41.560> tear<00:02:41.740> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.950> thread<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.730> longer<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
and tear on the thread the longer the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.880 
and tear on the thread the longer the
eye<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.690> less<00:02:43.870> wear<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.140> tear<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> thread

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
eye the less wear and tear on the thread

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.670 
eye the less wear and tear on the thread
right<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> universal<00:02:47.320> needle<00:02:47.560> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
right so with the universal needle you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.590 
right so with the universal needle you
have<00:02:47.709> kind<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.190> medium<00:02:48.610> size<00:02:48.880> kind<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
have kind of a medium size kind of a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.020 
have kind of a medium size kind of a
rounded<00:02:50.110> eye<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.680> pretty<00:02:51.520> much<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.790> very

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
rounded eye and pretty much a very

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.750 
rounded eye and pretty much a very
rounded<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.690> blunt<00:02:52.990> tip<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:54.190> tip<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
rounded and blunt tip the tip of the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.420 
rounded and blunt tip the tip of the
needle<00:02:54.880> penetrates<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.959> fiber<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.980> doesn't

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
needle penetrates the fiber it doesn't

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.310 
needle penetrates the fiber it doesn't
cut<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.820> fabric<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.300> just<00:02:58.480> separates<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
cut the fabric it just separates the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.610 
cut the fabric it just separates the
weave<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.459> more<00:03:00.940> aggressive<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.050> tip<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
weave so the more aggressive the tip the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.760 
weave so the more aggressive the tip the
faster<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> penetrates<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.240> fiber<00:03:04.480> right<00:03:04.840> so

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
faster it penetrates the fiber right so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.530 
faster it penetrates the fiber right so
let's<00:03:06.220> talk<00:03:06.370> about<00:03:06.430> some<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.970> bigger<00:03:07.270> eye
