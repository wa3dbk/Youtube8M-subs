00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.390> this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.870> sludge<00:00:01.110> which<00:00:01.650> check<00:00:01.920> some

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so this is the sludge which check some

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.370 
so this is the sludge which check some
levels<00:00:02.490> inside<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> tank<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
levels inside the tank and this is the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.940 
levels inside the tank and this is the
outlet<00:00:05.450> this<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.750> sludge<00:00:07.200> buildup<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
outlet this is a sludge buildup on the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.209 
outlet this is a sludge buildup on the
bottom<00:00:08.870> there's<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.960> real<00:00:10.230> brief<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.800> should

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
bottom there's a real brief this should

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.310 
bottom there's a real brief this should
be<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> clear<00:00:11.700> zone<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> problem<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
be a clear zone so the problem here is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.170 
be a clear zone so the problem here is
these<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.890> foot<00:00:20.160> marks<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.760> we've<00:00:20.939> got

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
these are one foot marks so we've got

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540 
these are one foot marks so we've got
two<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.689> half<00:00:21.840> feet<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.350> sludge<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
two and a half feet of sludge on the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
two and a half feet of sludge on the
bottom<00:00:23.640> which<00:00:24.119> means<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> does<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> be

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
bottom which means it does need to be

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
bottom which means it does need to be
pumped<00:00:25.760> this<00:00:26.760> tank<00:00:27.029> you'd<00:00:27.180> only<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> see

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
pumped this tank you'd only like to see

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.700 
pumped this tank you'd only like to see
it<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> foot<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.400> less<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it about a foot or less and so this is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.880 
it about a foot or less and so this is
the<00:00:31.830> indicator<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:33.469> there's<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.739> this

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the indicator of that there's that this

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
the indicator of that there's that this
is<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> second<00:00:35.579> compartment<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is the second compartment and then the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:57.229 
is the second compartment and then the
first<00:00:36.600> compartment<00:00:36.899> even<00:00:37.380> worse<00:00:56.120> on<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
first compartment even worse on the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
first compartment even worse on the
bottom<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.629> usually<00:00:57.989> an<00:00:58.079> indicator<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:59.059> little

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
bottom is usually an indicator of little

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.410 
bottom is usually an indicator of little
views<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> long<00:01:00.899> period<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> time<00:01:01.969> or<00:01:02.969> or

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
views over a long period of time or or

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
views over a long period of time or or
vacancy<00:01:12.380> these<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:14.010> great<00:01:15.140> but<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
vacancy these are great but in here you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.820 
vacancy these are great but in here you
can<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> baffle<00:01:18.210> it'd<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.590> nice

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
can see this baffle it'd be really nice

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.640 
can see this baffle it'd be really nice
to<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.700> screen<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to put up a screen on that so we do be a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
to put up a screen on that so we do be a
filter<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> prevent<00:01:23.340> any<00:01:23.700> solids<00:01:24.210> from

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
filter to prevent any solids from

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
filter to prevent any solids from
escaping<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> tank<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.770> into<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
escaping from the tank and out into the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
escaping from the tank and out into the
drain<00:01:26.369> field<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.750> eventually<00:01:27.960> plug

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
drain field which will eventually plug

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
drain field which will eventually plug
up<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> drain<00:01:29.009> field<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
up the drain field so that would be a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.380 
up the drain field so that would be a
recommendation<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> particular<00:01:31.770> tank

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
recommendation for this particular tank

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
recommendation for this particular tank
otherwise<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:33.990> need<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> pumping<00:01:34.650> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
otherwise it will need a pumping but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
otherwise it will need a pumping but
everything<00:01:36.000> looks<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.360> great<00:01:36.450> shape<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
everything looks in great shape the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.249 
everything looks in great shape the
baffles<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.860> condition<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> when

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
baffles are in good condition so when

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
baffles are in good condition so when
you<00:01:46.439> let<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> water<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.880> bathtub<00:01:48.060> or

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you let the water out of your bathtub or

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.670 
you let the water out of your bathtub or
flush<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> toilet<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> give<00:01:49.860> us

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.530 

comes<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.490> comes<00:01:56.700> into<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
comes out it comes into here in that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.859 
comes out it comes into here in that
baffle<00:01:58.049> acts<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:59.549> distribute<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> prevent

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
baffle acts to distribute it and prevent

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.780 
baffle acts to distribute it and prevent
it<00:02:00.899> from<00:02:00.960> breaking<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.490> first

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it from breaking up and so this first

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
it from breaking up and so this first
compartment<00:02:03.180> takes<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.810> two-thirds<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
compartment takes up two-thirds of the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
compartment takes up two-thirds of the
tank<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> thousand<00:02:05.579> gallon<00:02:05.880> tank<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.659> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
tank it's a thousand gallon tank and so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
tank it's a thousand gallon tank and so
2/3<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> first<00:02:08.190> compartment

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
2/3 of that is this first compartment

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.639 
2/3 of that is this first compartment
where<00:02:08.970> your<00:02:09.090> solids<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.170> settle<00:02:10.440> out

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
where your solids will settle out

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.440 
where your solids will settle out
there's

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
there's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.339 
there's
more<00:02:11.620> scum<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.980> top<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:14.349> and

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
more scum up on top that you can see and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.020 
more scum up on top that you can see and
then<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.650> den<00:02:15.860> there's<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.340> wall<00:02:16.670> there's<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
then this den there's a a wall there's a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
then this den there's a a wall there's a
there's<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.569> baffle<00:02:18.019> in<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> middle<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.739> then

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
there's a baffle in the middle and then

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.500 
there's a baffle in the middle and then
the<00:02:19.010> second<00:02:19.400> compartment<00:02:19.879> is<00:02:19.970> only<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.239> third

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
the second compartment is only a third

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
the second compartment is only a third
of<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.750> side<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.250> lot<00:02:22.430> clearer

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
of the side and it's a lot clearer

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.520 
of the side and it's a lot clearer
that's<00:02:23.030> why<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.300> don't<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.840> scum<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.290> top

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
that's why we don't have the scum on top

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100 
that's why we don't have the scum on top
for<00:02:25.459> further<00:02:25.700> settling<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.959> goes

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
for further settling and then it goes

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.630 
for further settling and then it goes
out<00:02:27.319> through<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.769> outlet<00:02:27.920> baffle<00:02:28.459> where<00:02:28.610> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
out through that outlet baffle where I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.699 
out through that outlet baffle where I
recommended<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.269> filter<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.560> this

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
recommended the filter and in this

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.620 
recommended the filter and in this
particular<00:02:30.950> system<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:31.819> all<00:02:31.970> gravity<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
particular system it's all gravity and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.300 
particular system it's all gravity and
so<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:32.989> flows<00:02:33.290> out<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.069> looped

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
so it just flows out and it's a looped

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.270 
so it just flows out and it's a looped
system<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.300> there's<00:02:35.510> three<00:02:35.810> lines<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:37.220> a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
system so there's three lines and a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.470 
system so there's three lines and a
rectangle<00:02:37.849> out<00:02:37.970> there<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.360> they're<00:02:38.450> all

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
rectangle out there and they're all

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.960 
rectangle out there and they're all
looped<00:02:38.870> together<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:40.250> newer<00:02:40.459> ones<00:02:40.790> would

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
looped together the newer ones would

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.580 
looped together the newer ones would
have<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.120> distribution<00:02:41.599> box<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.379> one

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
have a distribution box so this one

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.949 
have a distribution box so this one
doesn't<00:02:42.970> go<00:02:43.970> away<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.299> designed<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.810> just

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
doesn't go away it was designed it just

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.350 
doesn't go away it was designed it just
goes<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> tee<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.580> then<00:02:46.730> gravity<00:02:46.970> does

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
goes in with a tee and then gravity does

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.759 
goes in with a tee and then gravity does
the<00:02:47.390> rest<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.790> that's<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.970> kind<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.769> flow

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
the rest so that's a kind of a flow

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.460 
the rest so that's a kind of a flow
report<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.400> how<00:02:52.489> things<00:02:52.700> work<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:54.290> it's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
report for how things work and it's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.990 
report for how things work and it's
really<00:02:54.650> creative<00:02:55.160> how<00:02:55.280> they've<00:02:55.489> got<00:02:55.880> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
really creative how they've got the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.690 
really creative how they've got the
risers<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.569> here<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.110> fantastic<00:02:57.700> most

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
risers on here this is fantastic most

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.130 
risers on here this is fantastic most
people<00:02:59.060> would<00:02:59.150> have<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.299> filled<00:02:59.720> over<00:03:00.019> the

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
tank we wouldn't have that so it's in

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:12.490
