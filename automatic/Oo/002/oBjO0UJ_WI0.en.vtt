that<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:56.260> contraption<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:56.950> hooks<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that the contraption that hooks it to

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.280 
that the contraption that hooks it to
the<00:02:57.520> line<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.270> basically<00:02:58.450> spiral<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.170> on

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the line and you basically spiral it on
