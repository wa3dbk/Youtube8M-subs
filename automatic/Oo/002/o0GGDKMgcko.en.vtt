00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.679
 so hello everyone is greeted to one 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.929
 back to the basics five things minecraft 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.289
 did not know it was 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 terrifying in relation to the commodity project 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.529
 Less that knew that you have to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 hell can not put water 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.400
 There was really a lot of comment in the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 direction i thought this one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 the result will be a few things 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 to show that you might really 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.530
 but he did not know yet which one he is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.969
 small useful shortcuts and tricks in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 Generally , this is what this is about 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 but that may be a bit simpler 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.489
 For many, this has been playing for some time 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.480
 but that's how I got it 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.620
 maybe not even like that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 can be interesting 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 I also have some of the tips now 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 just recently learned where I am 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 minecraft for over two years 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 play and I thought quite a lot 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 just before 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 So the iphone version this time 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 if no comments are displayed because 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.699
 the things that I'm going to show now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 are all of each one I knew and that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.170
 I think that many of you still 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 did not know as much as complicated 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 just start 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.260
 Let's go to the first thing 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.610
 you can easily if you are in the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 creative modders are complete 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 Empty inventory not want another 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.939
 click out or destroy the items 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.400
 but also with shift and click on that 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.900
 ixs the complete inventory delete the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.830
 is everything you hold everything in the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 slot can be deleted 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 and you can do this eternal back and forth too 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.400
 I have also saved recently 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 to be aware next you can too 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 without the enchantment of flame or flame 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 Create burning arrows on the bow 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 by lava by shooting I have the times 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.710
 maybe I do not have one 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 but sometimes it is whole 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 Useful as you can see the arrows 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.810
 Next, we already burn 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 one could not know in hell 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
 put water to extinguish 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.600
 I have a video recently 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 uploaded and that was the true 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.790
 quicktipp what a little annoying because it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.189
 you actually have to know that too 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.149
 this format here again that one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.860
 get a bit easier 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.200
 However, there is a possibility like 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 you can erase yourself in hell 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.440
 why i have no kettle too 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.500
 have and still no water but me 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.700
 do not know 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.810
 at least if you should burn 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.790
 I will stay that longer 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.860
 it does not go away immediately and briefly 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.710
 You can put in a kettle to die 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.300
 go in and clear with it also in 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.400
 the hell and you can also in hell 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.070
 kettle with water fill it 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.300
 Does that mean you can work yourself 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.860
 so also in the hell with water 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.110
 if you put the water in the boiler 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.980
 dead then the boiler does not jump 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.990
 bad then next man has in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.700
 the hell practically infinite it man 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.320
 just have to go and get outside 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.390
 Take a bowl with you austria 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.630
 crafted wood and looks you can 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.489
 with the help of mushrooms the only only in 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.280
 both species spawn here in hell 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.690
 and everywhere in masses partly there 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.040
 you can get any amount of mushroom troops 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.660
 make it out and then as food 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.970
 that means you actually have in 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 the hell eat pretty much infinity 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.910
 could again which are everywhere 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.860
 mushrooms and last for today 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.290
 today a hell of a special one like it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.519
 it looks like there is one 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.870
 drank the man without annoying need 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.150
 I always thought I always needed 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.709
 Which company recently noticed it 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.200
 is also a kind of frank wittmer 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.090
 no budget warts needs and that is 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.980
 thanks to the weakness of her 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.269
 water bottles and enjoyed it 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.090
 you just do not need the construction sites 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.430
 award and if that is hewn through 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.250
 we get the fiction out if we 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 the fiction with a fermenter both 1 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.870
 prove if I have already done it 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.760
 we get the push sweetness out 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.500
 actually goes extremely strong 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.840
 actually for opponents pvp and so sure 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.860
 but not for this one needs no budget 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.660
 madsen is but for ever and 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.250
 we would have a small sleeve special 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.049
 a few small ones, too 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.100
 useful tips that I now only 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.840
 By the way, I actually had 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.790
 never considered for one 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.290
 Fifth in minecraft follow me 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.989
 actually, pretty much everyone thought that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.360
 you know how many of them are back 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.920
 you knew this and that many things 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.269
 time I did exactly it writes 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.739
 really in it if you really so 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.489
 I knew that as the feedback for the 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.650
 to follow 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.959
 if I take such things in mind 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.549
 you can or should try anyway 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.919
 further into the most complicated of the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.380
 go to the most complicated and then 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.139
 Select facts and therefore easy 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.389
 was the result 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.889
 ok or would prefer even more difficult 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.689
 but she looked at me when she was 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.520
 thing that you do not have much 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.979
 that was possible , however 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.259
 but informative I think 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.969
 then i would say simons to the next one 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.279
 Follow five things minecraft or 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.360

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.129
