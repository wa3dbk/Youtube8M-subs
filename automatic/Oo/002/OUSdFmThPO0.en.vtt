night<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.060> know<00:02:16.590> definitely<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.860> obviously<00:02:18.400> a

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
night you know definitely so obviously a

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.970 
night you know definitely so obviously a
lot<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.239> us<00:02:19.870> teams<00:02:20.230> didn't<00:02:20.500> bother<00:02:20.590> coming

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
lot of us teams didn't bother coming

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.710 
lot of us teams didn't bother coming
this<00:02:21.159> time<00:02:21.340> around<00:02:21.640> which<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.120> quite<00:02:22.299> strange

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
this time around which is quite strange

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.000 
this time around which is quite strange
because<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.079> lot<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.349> them<00:02:23.560> did<00:02:23.769> for<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
because a lot of them did for the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.399 
because a lot of them did for the
previous<00:02:24.129> egel<00:02:24.640> such<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:24.939> optic<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.629> an<00:02:25.780> MP

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
previous egel such as optic and an MP

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.100 
previous egel such as optic and an MP
gaming<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.159> then<00:02:27.280> fear<00:02:27.519> as<00:02:27.700> well<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.079> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
gaming and then fear as well what do you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.509 
gaming and then fear as well what do you
think<00:02:29.349> about<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:29.829> you're<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.159> the

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
think about that because you're on the

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.970 
think about that because you're on the
only<00:02:30.879> US<00:02:31.150> team<00:02:31.360> here<00:02:31.540> at<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.720> minute<00:02:31.959> um<00:02:32.769> I

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
only US team here at the minute um I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.460 
only US team here at the minute um I
think<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.489> because<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.909> lot<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.629> teams<00:02:34.930> in

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
think it's because a lot of teams in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.559 
think it's because a lot of teams in
North<00:02:36.370> America<00:02:36.760> qualified<00:02:37.180> through<00:02:37.360> league

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
North America qualified through league

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.170 
North America qualified through league
play<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.560> they<00:02:38.859> lost<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.250> lot<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.400> practice<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
play so they lost a lot of practice and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.690 
play so they lost a lot of practice and
I<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:42.010> wanted<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> use<00:02:42.519> this

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
I think that they wanted to use this

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.880 
I think that they wanted to use this
time<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.230> practice<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.379> get<00:02:44.470> back<00:02:44.650> into

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
time to practice and get back into

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.119 
time to practice and get back into
things<00:02:45.129> before<00:02:45.609> Cod<00:02:45.790> championships<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.950> my

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
things before Cod championships in my

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.559 
things before Cod championships in my
opinion<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.489> reason<00:02:48.970> they<00:02:49.090> haven't<00:02:49.269> attended

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
opinion the reason they haven't attended

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.259 
opinion the reason they haven't attended
EG<00:02:49.810> else<00:02:50.049> was<00:02:50.290> one<00:02:50.889> because<00:02:51.819> all<00:02:52.150> these

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
EG else was one because all these

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.940 
EG else was one because all these
obviously<00:02:52.930> called<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.349> championship<00:02:53.829> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
obviously called the championship is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
obviously called the championship is
right<00:02:54.129> around<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.370> corner<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> lot<00:02:55.389> of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
right around the corner so a lot of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.849 
right around the corner so a lot of
teams<00:02:55.569> are<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:56.530> they're<00:02:56.650> better<00:02:56.769> off

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
teams are just think they're better off

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.649 
teams are just think they're better off
practicing<00:02:57.370> at<00:02:57.549> home<00:02:57.609> which<00:02:58.299> they're<00:02:58.450> kind<00:02:58.629> of

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
practicing at home which they're kind of

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.509 
practicing at home which they're kind of
wrong<00:02:58.900> because<00:02:59.260> i<00:02:59.470> mean<00:02:59.739> i'd<00:02:59.859> go<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.099> land<00:03:00.340> and

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
wrong because i mean i'd go to land and

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.550 
wrong because i mean i'd go to land and
practice<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:00.849> land<00:03:01.180> i<00:03:01.629> know<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.139> expensive

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
practice that land i know it's expensive

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.770 
practice that land i know it's expensive
for<00:03:03.489> practice<00:03:03.909> don't<00:03:04.359> think<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.659> way

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
for practice don't think of it that way

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.210 
for practice don't think of it that way
we<00:03:05.019> obviously<00:03:05.170> want<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> come<00:03:05.799> here<00:03:05.889> and<00:03:06.010> win

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
we obviously want to come here and win

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.490 
we obviously want to come here and win
but<00:03:07.000> another<00:03:07.569> thing<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.049> law<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> teams

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
but another thing is the law of teams

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.080 
but another thing is the law of teams

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
can't fund themselves over here they

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.330 
can't fund themselves over here they
they<00:03:10.599> can't<00:03:10.810> find<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.079> reason<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.409> consider<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
they can't find a reason to consider you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.119 
they can't find a reason to consider you
like<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.519> payout<00:03:12.790> isn't<00:03:13.209> as<00:03:13.359> much<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.230> then

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
like the payout isn't as much and then

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.220 
like the payout isn't as much and then
also<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.549> people<00:03:16.180> or<00:03:16.450> talk<00:03:16.659> speculating
