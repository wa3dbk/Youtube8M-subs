Spidey<00:01:59.990> definitely<00:02:00.439> has<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.619> much<00:02:00.890> longer<00:02:01.220> face

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
Spidey definitely has a much longer face

Spidey definitely has a much longer face
and<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.330> eyes<00:02:02.540> are<00:02:02.840> just<00:02:02.869> designed

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and the eyes are just designed

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260 
and the eyes are just designed
differently<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.100> they<00:02:04.220> are<00:02:04.310> not<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.820> same<00:02:05.030> but

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
differently so they are not the same but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.090 
differently so they are not the same but
they<00:02:05.390> are<00:02:05.420> similar<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.439> here<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.770> compared

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
they are similar and here it is compared

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.009 
they are similar and here it is compared
to<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.280> amazing<00:02:07.460> spider-man<00:02:07.970> 2<00:02:08.209> head<00:02:08.540> sculpt

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and the eyes do look different but you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
and the eyes do look different but you
could<00:02:11.150> tell<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.510> amazing<00:02:11.810> spider-man<00:02:12.170> 2<00:02:12.290> is

a lot of black paint on this guy nice
shading<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.130> throughout<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:59.120> think

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
shading on it throughout I just think

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.820 
shading on it throughout I just think
this<00:03:59.360> is<00:03:59.420> really<00:03:59.720> badass<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.380> lot<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.620> people

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
this is really badass a lot of people

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.290 
this is really badass a lot of people
think<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.160> kind<00:04:01.430> of<00:04:01.490> stuff<00:04:01.670> can<00:04:01.790> get<00:04:01.940> choppy

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
think this kind of stuff can get choppy

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.090 
think this kind of stuff can get choppy
over<00:04:02.600> here<00:04:02.780> with<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.230> articulation<00:04:03.830> but

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
over here with all this articulation but

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770 
over here with all this articulation but
I<00:04:04.310> like<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.820> actually<00:04:04.940> don't<00:04:05.330> mind<00:04:05.480> if<00:04:05.690> the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
I like it actually don't mind if the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.300 
I like it actually don't mind if the
figure<00:04:05.990> looks<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.290> little<00:04:06.380> chopped<00:04:06.770> up<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.130> long

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
figure looks a little chopped up as long

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.890 
figure looks a little chopped up as long
as<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.520> articulation<00:04:08.210> works<00:04:08.450> really<00:04:08.690> well

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
as the articulation works really well

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.260 
as the articulation works really well
and<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:09.320> guy<00:04:09.530> has<00:04:09.740> great<00:04:10.130> articulation<00:04:10.850> so

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
and this guy has great articulation so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.850 
and this guy has great articulation so
the<00:04:11.420> head<00:04:11.630> can<00:04:11.810> move<00:04:11.840> all<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.470> way<00:04:12.560> up<00:04:12.710> right

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
the head can move all the way up right

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.590 
the head can move all the way up right
there<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.400> head<00:04:13.520> joint<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.300> that<00:04:14.450> is

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
there on the head joint I think that is

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.870 
there on the head joint I think that is
fantastic<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:16.190> get<00:04:16.370> them<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.549> look

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
fantastic and you can get them to look

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.000 
fantastic and you can get them to look
down<00:04:17.299> as<00:04:17.510> well<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.960> the<00:04:18.140> head<00:04:18.320> rotates<00:04:18.770> right

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
down as well and the head rotates right

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.050 
down as well and the head rotates right
here<00:04:19.220> at<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> neck<00:04:19.609> too

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
here at the neck too

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060 
here at the neck too
he<00:04:20.270> also<00:04:20.420> has<00:04:20.630> his<00:04:20.660> own<00:04:20.960> neck<00:04:21.290> articulation<00:04:21.950> as

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
he also has his own neck articulation as

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.190 
he also has his own neck articulation as
well<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> neck<00:04:22.730> can<00:04:22.880> rotate<00:04:23.150> side<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.720> side

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
well so the neck can rotate side to side

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.950 
well so the neck can rotate side to side
and<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.980> can<00:04:25.280> get<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.670> neck<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.090> look<00:04:26.120> up<00:04:26.540> and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and you can get the neck to look up and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.530 
and you can get the neck to look up and
move<00:04:27.650> down<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.370> has<00:04:28.550> its<00:04:28.760> own<00:04:28.970> hinge<00:04:29.360> right

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
move down so it has its own hinge right

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.150 
move down so it has its own hinge right
here<00:04:29.750> at<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.900> neck<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.230> he<00:04:30.260> can<00:04:30.440> look<00:04:30.590> all<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
here at the neck so he can look all the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.410 
here at the neck so he can look all the
way<00:04:31.220> backwards<00:04:31.550> Wow

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
long but actually when you straighten it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.390 
long but actually when you straighten it
out<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.260> doesn't<00:04:36.470> look<00:04:36.560> too<00:04:36.740> weird<00:04:36.920> so<00:04:37.040> yeah

he<00:04:40.310> has<00:04:40.340> dual<00:04:40.729> armpit<00:04:41.180> joints<00:04:41.510> actually<00:04:41.930> so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
he has dual armpit joints actually so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.409 
he has dual armpit joints actually so
one<00:04:42.590> set<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.860> armpit<00:04:43.280> joints<00:04:43.669> right<00:04:43.910> here<00:04:44.270> that

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
one set of armpit joints right here that

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:44.810 
one set of armpit joints right here that
move

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
move

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.670 
move
in<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.090> out<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.990> get<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.320> kind<00:04:46.590> of

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
in and out so you get that kind of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.320 
in and out so you get that kind of
movement<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.100> then<00:04:47.220> there's<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.610> extra

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
movement and then there's this extra

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.180 
movement and then there's this extra
hinge<00:04:48.570> right<00:04:48.810> here<00:04:49.200> inside<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.130> that

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
hinge right here inside of it and that

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.820 
hinge right here inside of it and that
moves<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.000> down<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.740> cool

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
moves up and down so that is really cool

you<00:05:20.160> just<00:05:20.340> drop<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.550> right<00:05:20.700> into<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.090> seams

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
you just drop it right into the seams

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.820 
you just drop it right into the seams
and<00:05:21.450> then<00:05:21.570> as<00:05:21.780> it<00:05:21.960> dries<00:05:22.170> you<00:05:22.200> move<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.680> back

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
and then as it dries you move it back

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.500 
and then as it dries you move it back
and<00:05:22.980> forth<00:05:23.070> that's<00:05:23.400> how<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.550> fix<00:05:23.850> loose<00:05:24.120> joints

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
anyway he has a waist rotation right

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.280 
anyway he has a waist rotation right
over<00:05:26.640> here<00:05:26.850> he<00:05:27.210> has<00:05:27.240> these<00:05:27.450> nice<00:05:27.630> T<00:05:27.900> joints

over here he has these nice T joints
that<00:05:28.380> move<00:05:28.560> outward<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.580> can't<00:05:29.790> rotate

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
that move outward and you can't rotate

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.670 
that move outward and you can't rotate
forward<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:30.540> do<00:05:30.690> get<00:05:30.840> some<00:05:31.020> paint<00:05:31.320> rubbing

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
forward you do get some paint rubbing

off though on these hinges which is a

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.910 
off though on these hinges which is a
little<00:05:33.660> annoying<00:05:33.960> you<00:05:34.200> can<00:05:34.320> see<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.800> was

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
little annoying you can see that it was

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.830 
little annoying you can see that it was
applied<00:05:35.280> but<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.760> is<00:05:35.880> slowly<00:05:36.150> coming<00:05:36.540> off

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
applied but it is slowly coming off

applied but it is slowly coming off
which<00:05:37.080> kind<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.410> sucks<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:37.890> not<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.190> worst

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
which kind of sucks but not the worst

which kind of sucks but not the worst
thing<00:05:38.700> in<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.790> world<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:39.390> that's<00:05:39.810> pretty

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
thing in the world so that's pretty

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.660 
thing in the world so that's pretty
awesome<00:05:40.170> though<00:05:40.530> articulation<00:05:41.190> wise<00:05:41.310> he<00:05:41.580> has

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
knees rotation at the boot ankles moved

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.690 
knees rotation at the boot ankles moved
down<00:05:45.180> up<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:46.110> articulation<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:46.980> a<00:05:47.160> little<00:05:47.550> bit

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
down up to articulation and a little bit

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.520 
down up to articulation and a little bit

actually<00:05:49.860> moves<00:05:50.040> outward<00:05:50.490> more<00:05:50.790> than<00:05:50.970> inward

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
actually moves outward more than inward

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.900 
actually moves outward more than inward
on<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.720> side<00:05:51.960> this<00:05:52.590> ankle<00:05:53.040> actually<00:05:53.460> moves<00:05:53.820> a

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
on this side this ankle actually moves a

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.280 
on this side this ankle actually moves a
little<00:05:53.970> bit<00:05:54.150> more<00:05:54.300> inward<00:05:54.660> than<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.050> other
