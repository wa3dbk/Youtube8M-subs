00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
before the villages before they were

before the villages before they were
formed<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.710> was<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:46.949> dark<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.610> gritty<00:04:47.879> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
formed it was so dark and gritty and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.390 
formed it was so dark and gritty and
really<00:04:48.900> messed<00:04:49.139> up<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.889> whole<00:04:50.039> thing<00:04:50.250> with

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
really messed up the whole thing with

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.679 
really messed up the whole thing with
atomic<00:04:50.669> sends<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.300> was<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.449> thing<00:04:51.599> I

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
atomic sends you that was the thing I

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.029 
atomic sends you that was the thing I
think<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:51.930> really<00:04:52.169> stuck<00:04:52.439> out<00:04:52.590> for<00:04:52.740> me<00:04:52.889> the

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
think that really stuck out for me the

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.920 
think that really stuck out for me the
most<00:04:53.069> yeah<00:04:53.969> he<00:04:54.180> wasn't<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.509> character<00:04:54.689> we've

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
most yeah he wasn't a character we've

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.179 
most yeah he wasn't a character we've
never<00:04:55.110> seen<00:04:55.349> before<00:04:55.409> and<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:55.889> didn't<00:04:56.099> really

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
never seen before and we didn't really

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.559 
never seen before and we didn't really
get<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.400> lot<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.699> chance<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.060> know<00:04:57.240> him<00:04:57.449> before

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
get a lot of chance to know him before

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.070
