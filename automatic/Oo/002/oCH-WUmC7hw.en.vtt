00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.380
 it is requested 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.299
 Come have Holy Spirit 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.269
 Welcome as it is and unhurt 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.479
 and today there is one again 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.440
 severance 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.560
 Velcro closure from the mentioned areas 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.449
 from the already 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.050
 she paints a lot of whiskey and then I never do it 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.509
 at the beginning points 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.169
 fit double digits content 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.839
 Menger from Zielmarkt 6 4 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.510
 and in addition, I have been tried for a year constant leadership and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.199
 therefore important myself now on the left foot 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.309
 This was either the 6 00 o'clock 079 thereby in Andechser 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 Video and beyond are only available here 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.520
 primarily for intention 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 stop by Jana Kainz 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 and if you look at these bottles closely 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600
 Rumpelstil on the back 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.220
 Hawthorne is on it first 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.430
 at Risen 3006 after bottles I have the 2005 with 41 seconds 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.080
 this is rarely shown but 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.340
 from which barrels these 3000 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.750
 600 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.440
 Bottles are bottled and so they all date from November to November 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.590
 middle of December 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810
 at that time 93 and were bottled 6 9 2010 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.830
 this means 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.870
 There is already a change in the market 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.049
 We all prÃ¶ll 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.400
 we do Kentucky's bottlings 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.720
 Share to 46 5 percent 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.170
 look at this year 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 har 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 This does not quite look like eating 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.740
 also lead to a firm for this firmly in the arm what to feel 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 why and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 that promises 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 never look for anything altogether characters 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.380
 at the distillery 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.290
 or the influence of the two stock exchange operators could rewrite 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 not perfect now 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.120
 intense find Shari and swanky face is covered No 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.540
 Balke war distillery character still 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 if a little bit of air 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.569
 yes very bitter for him that applies for in the walls is open up here 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.899
 please give up 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.070
 that the bands on 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.819
 The Game for Christian Percentage has been founded since 1836 since then 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.749
 that was always family owned 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.909
 These are not big corporations 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.890
 who really hides them when small 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.169
 distillery 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.459
 a would like to support 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 should be preferred at no fake is to grab 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.990
 because here 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.770
 There really is no company that never loses 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.549
 and they really did it 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.650
 to turn off her uncle Farkas Bisky all over the world 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.479
 that you are practical 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.939
 from Japan via New Zealand to the USA 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
 Everywhere they are single paints whiskey also actually finds 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.169
 that I was not there 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.169
 as one of the first five bottles of whiskey club 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.869
 why we 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.349
 had a meal bottled in the 90s 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.789
 but they always had good luck for 2012 as a bottle 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:19.779
 still there 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.759
 this is how the seas can acidify 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.069
 At that time there were already 3000 bottles of cans filled 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.459
 less goal that means that even the x7 is even stronger 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.389
 Apple had to 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.129
 and also there we decided for it 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.379
 About half proportionately, El Sheikh shouted summoned as ours 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 Father intense game I like her very dominant 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.510
 Nonetheless, 110 JPY is still something like this 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.329
 as Anja Refill Shepherd 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.069
 Biskys are so beautiful when all one in it SchÃ¶ppner percent euro 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.709
 deals 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.329
 mostly nothing 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.090
 that the plane is almost four euros to Schick what is there so you have to then 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.330
 read more closely between the lines "What did not say something 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.529
 first 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.539
 seer 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.400
 sweet 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.749
 therefore lets 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.219
 and there is this for Christmas 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.499
 Fruitcake 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.390
 maybe this Fear Cup still has some nuts in it 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.620
 suitable for 1 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 and that's exactly what it is 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.090
 maybe one or the other cowardly 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.090
 all together sticky sweet packaging 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 a bit more 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.500
 Steam from bread also sell cake dough 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:57.900
 the rich should 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.360
 to have with her bitterly cold the dog rose this last 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.129
 in October hardly noticeable 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.129
 46 '- Hertha calculates can be adjusted 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 yes try now 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.819
 really nice 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.389
 Not a few are fluent in the language 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.370
 with a 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.540
 on the tongue the counterpart which is not a test criterion tongue tip 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.759
 intense and now the property is second off 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.409
 Roth long while 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.409
 lies in front 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.279
 I believe frozen with us 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.150
 with the present study, see 2020 meet 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.169
 the predecessor of this bottle 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.169
 At that time there were some best bottles 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.919
 the it-industry store are available 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.830
 in relation to the price 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.360
 Naturally 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.180
 counted 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.180
 Carinthia revenge always love you 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.819
 if you have this 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.800
 this is the opponent of this complexity between no Reichert and oak barrel 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.239
 The coach is actually dark from the wood 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.949
 Dunk from Scheers 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:30.699
 that is already achieved 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.699
 that is exactly right 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:42.619
 wonderful 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.830
 Castrol 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.389
 when those three goals are over Sixth Bottle 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.639
 maybe there will be enough of Reimer's fulfillment 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.639
 from Horst f 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.819
 borderland 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.039
 there are other few Sat 1 gave lead 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.199
 but she always determines so much fun filling for us 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.800
 was prepared because with the Fraggles it never really comes 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.229
 to significant bottlenecks 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.169
 because 1 privately run Panerai 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.610
 pay close attention 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.689
 how their offshoots are populated the act is sufficient for me to act 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.889
 can be free once 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.189
 that he's almost too bad I'm glad if you look after these bottles only 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.189
 see above in the shop 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.349
 hahahaha
