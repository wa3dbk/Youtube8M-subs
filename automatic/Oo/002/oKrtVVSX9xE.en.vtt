00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.420
 How about friends here I bring you a video tutorial so that you can learn 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.890
 hit one or sb for this we're going to need a program called a 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.630
 boil pin I leave the link at the end to start we open my pc find out 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.919
 amos the bsb I recommend a good fast format but you choose 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.300
 make sure it's like fat32 if it does not it will not serve us because that's how we 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.269
 the program asks for it, we wait for the action to be carried out once the 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.840
 operation 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.530
 already without data in the ue it is due now if it starts the good thing we go to the desk 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.820
 or to the place where they kept the program to flip the eu it looks even though I 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.730
 I recommend a desk to make it faster we execute the program and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 we wait for it to be ready to be used since the program is ready to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.100
 should be sure not to touch the part where it says distribution if the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.730
 program that they are going to use is 20 what interests us is in the part below 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.510
 where it says disk image in that part below we look for the button where they appear 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.210
 the three points and we click 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 from there we will get a window where we will look for the iso file of the program 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 20 I recommend leaving it at the desk so it will be easier 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.259
 find it and also faster faster we selected the iso file and it 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.280
 we click on open we make sure it is the one that looks like we want to bounce 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.159
 we click on the button accept here start the action where 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.640
 automatically the program will be responsible for extracting the data to the ue 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.230
 it looks and this will be done something I'll talk to you 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.350
 we wait for the four steps to take place, usually these steps are 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.180
 rapid 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.490
 if they use bbm and let's understand that this is not very heavy 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.840
 since the four steps were completed the one you see is now finally ready 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.880
 in the fourth step you will have two options for you to select the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.310
 first is to restart now and the second option is 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.400
 there you will select the option that suits you best 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.459
 I hope and that the tutorial has been explicit 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.560
 'see you later, friends
