00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
the secret is not much of a secret

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.060 

you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.940> go<00:01:54.120> through<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.600> mouth<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.500> here

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.420 

twice<00:01:59.070> actually<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.830> video<00:02:02.040> we're

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
twice actually and in this video we're

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.740 
twice actually and in this video we're
actually<00:02:02.550> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.910> do<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:05.360> how<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
actually going to do that how you do it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
actually going to do that how you do it
twice<00:02:07.250> looks<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.399> i'm<00:02:08.550> home<00:02:09.800> taking<00:02:10.800> them

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
twice looks like i'm home taking them

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.150 
twice looks like i'm home taking them
know<00:02:12.170> all<00:02:13.170> right<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.570> do<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.810> twice

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
know all right so you can do that twice

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.710 
know all right so you can do that twice
and<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.610> video<00:02:17.850> that's<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.570> we're

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
audio will come and pretty much I was

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.950 
audio will come and pretty much I was
actually<00:02:37.950> wondering<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.330> guys<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.750> want

actually wondering what you guys we want

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.070 
actually wondering what you guys we want
to<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:40.470> me<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.490> do<00:02:41.610> multiple<00:02:42.080> random

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
to see for me I can do multiple random

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.010 
to see for me I can do multiple random
clips<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.890> random<00:02:46.160> classic<00:02:47.160> maps<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.930> lot<00:02:48.930> of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
clips of random classic maps a lot of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.410 
clips of random classic maps a lot of
