 said that it has an area of ​​approximately 103 square kilometers and is 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.100

 world and face all the dangers that hid there like other thrones

 ap fourth we have a tea set only public entity the infringe 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 a predictable story and nothing original nevertheless presented several elements 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.170
 interesting to say 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 in the delight of the players of those times in which the memory 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.510
 of grand theft auto 3 was still fresh and present the plot of the game 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.600
 tour 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.400
 author of a detective whose violent methods have turned him into a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.230
 sort of police outcast and your mission will 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.490
 embark on a dangerous and frantic mission to discover the truth about 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.150
 disappearance of his father and the wave of crime that has taken over the city 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.820
 what is attractive is that it truncates 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.080
 writings of leather allowed you to venture for a pretty recreation 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.790
 exact today 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.740
 some cities of los angeles county like beverly hills and santa 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.400
 monica including details such as the names of streets and highways 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.840
 all this within a playground area of ​​approximately 641 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.210
 square kilometers I wanted to leave this area your character 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 disappeared and did 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 brides allowed from the map 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.430
 in third position mass effect 2 if you are thinking that this is a rpg more 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.349
 let me tell you that you are very wrong 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.390
 mass effect is shaping up to become a great classic 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:26.489
 the story revolves around the commander shepard a soldier tanned in 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.959
 the heat of the battle that has faced harsh tactical decisions what 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.809
 which has given it a very peculiar reputation among the high naval commands 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:40.039
 the interesting thing is that throughout the game you alone will have control of 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.669
 the events that take place in the galaxy and your decisions 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.129
 will directly impact the lives of your team and even those of several 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.449
 civilians who cross their path 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.779
 who knows 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.759
 the future of the galaxy could be much more linked to yours than it 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.209
 could you believe 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.430
 in effects you will have to cross the Milky Way in search of allies to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.219
 launch an attack on an unknown space sector for the purpose 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.620
 to find out what happened to all those human colonies 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.549
 they have mysteriously disappeared 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.760
 if the Milky Way is the scene of this game the number of locations 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.319
 potential is almost infinite however so far you can visit 22 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.620
 areas that contain 69 solar systems with an infinity of plane 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.629
 the space stations 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.239
 asteroid belts and other celestial bodies that you have the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 opportunity to visit to mitigate or explore 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:44.389
 in second place we have star wars galaxys input the fictional universe 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.899
 of the saga of star wars is huge it expands well beyond the series of 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:54.249
 movies featured in endless comic books animated series novels 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:55.309
 graphs 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:59.410
 cepeda precisely for that reason when the development of an embryo was announced 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 but based on this universe everyone knew that something big was about 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.240
 get along the adventure the players could visit three worlds 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.060
 each one presenting a playable area 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.099
 255 square kilometers 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.810
 besides that there were 12 space zones in which you could navigate 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.500
 freely throughout three thousand 400 cubic kilometers yes cubic although 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.380
 The most interesting thing is that these numbers have continued to grow with the 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.380
 Exit of new expansions 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.549
 i in the very first place we have the world benchmark razo 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.419
 It is one of the most famous games of all time and even some are 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.139
 would dare to say that it is one of the greatest successes in the history of 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.449
 digital entertainment staying on top of popularity after 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.020
 more than six years after its launch 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.060
 probably someone will say that this title does not allow users to travel 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.930
 for whole galaxies 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.870
 but nevertheless 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.710
 gets the great merit that the ruling is a place full of action and battles 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.340
 potential, unlike the second place in this list, the majority 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.189
 of space is only that passable sidereal space in a ship 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.430
 for the fourth time 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.470
 you can venture through three massive regions 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.830
 galindo or the eastern kingdoms conformed by different continents and 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.339
 Reynosa 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.330
 all surrounded 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.499
 but medicines 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.899
 although there is no official figure that reflects the total dimension of the Pope 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.019
 some players have calculated it in about 10 thousand square kilometers 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.019
 adding the territories of the expansions 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.299
 if we add all the triple and when the intimacy after that 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:47.839
 exist in web the size of this universe is multiplied so 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.839
 Awesome 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.880
 these are the most extensive games do not forget to be aware of more 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.680
