 end of the year this yes because we want 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 also that what is displayed and what of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.670
 time also for even a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 Goya nomination because we believe that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 we have that I start by saying that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 you papers 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.760
 a gay photographer and you finish me 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.770
 what is the history and the conflict of your 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 character is a film that treats 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.940
 meeting of a movie that invites 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 tolerance invites conversation 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.590
 there is beatriz valdés de rubia to be 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 tribal since that I just see if 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 doing by making a character is called 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 little star kills that is like the host a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 toc show this guy that says he says the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.330
 people who say it also brews in america 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 and it's something like that and the character 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.280
 particularly of them the voice of the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.160
 Prejudice the angle and character of Diego 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.410
 martínez the former photographer was father 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.510
 adolescent at age 15 she slept with 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.570
 her best friend and she has a son and so 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.290
 well they had to separate this one from their 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 son and mother let's say for a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.430
 very long time and the movie starts 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
 with the arrival of armandito to venezuela 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.590
 at a time where his father has a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.300
 couple that you want a couple is 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.430
 now another man who is another man yes 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.860
 What is a doctor called? 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.630
 Fabricio and well the movie 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 begins with the child knowing the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.680
 context of his father recognized him 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
 with a suitcase full of reproaches 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.970
 so 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.920
 Of course, the film is about many things 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.959
 talks about domestic violence talks about 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 gender violence 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.500
 there are characters that are touched with 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.140
 an incredible sensitivity 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.819
 Miguel Ferrary turned out to be a great 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.610
 director because in addition to a great actor 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.000
 so when an actor directs you 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.349
 language is more horizontal he said a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 wonderful thing he told us all 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.030
 we are already impossible to lie to him 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.060
 because I am a clear actor then I had 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 you had to work hard and do justice 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.720
 that story of which I remained 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.489
 completely seduced the day I read the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.280
 script that you learned throughout 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.140
 this process of interpreting your character 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.790
 and especially the plot of the movie in 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.549
 this topic that is also a pretty subject 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 hot in the media is violence 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.650
 against homosexuals also against 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
 the transgender people that teaching 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.319
 I leave you personally personally 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.940
 I am always a very open person 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.410
 let's say I do not believe in him 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 nuanced people in discriminating 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.370
 the people for their preference I think 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.319
 that sexuality does exist 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.670
 preferences no differences 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.349
 and I think that in this case, then, Miguel 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.989
 moved this story from the respect 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.760
 from sensitivity and it left me a lot 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.670
 as an actor he left me a wonderful team 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.950
 of work 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 they were the best and we really had to 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.459
 the best both the best sound the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.410
 best art direction the best 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.330
 direction of photography and left me to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.920
 great coworkers and for 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.470
 Of course, a character always leaves you 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.040
 you are something that one usually does not 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.970
 he reserves it or takes it away not so much for 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.430
 future projects 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.780
 because as she said norm leandro she 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.190
 says that she tries to always forget 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.510
 the works for not being able to repeat be 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.400
 clear and in this case for me the premise 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.080
 is that I'm taking me a character 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.850
 that gave me many, many thanks 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.430
 guillermo and congratulations for the success 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.979
 what are you having with this movie and 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.329
 I hope it also reaches the rest of 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.889
 latin america for good 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.330
 performances and the level of production and 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.250
 also by the subject that approaches 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.139
 william garcia thank you and enchanted 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.840

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.460

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.590
 productions that originate from the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.060
 city ​​of miami sure good we're going to 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.860
 pause the last of the program 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.560
 I promise that it will be very short and 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.190
 we come back with the end of this hour with 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.960
 ibm is to be miss venezuela 2011 second 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.600
