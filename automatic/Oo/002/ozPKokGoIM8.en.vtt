00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.670 

you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.800 

that's<00:03:27.370> what<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.730> should<00:03:28.000> look<00:03:28.030> like<00:03:28.180> somewhat

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
that's what it should look like somewhat

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.720 
that's what it should look like somewhat
probably<00:03:29.590> mixed<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.980> better<00:03:30.189> but<00:03:30.430> since<00:03:30.609> I'm

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
probably mixed in better but since I'm

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.610 
probably mixed in better but since I'm
holding<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.090> camera<00:03:31.299> with<00:03:31.540> one<00:03:31.810> hand<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.349> or

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
holding the camera with one hand and or

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.229 
holding the camera with one hand and or
me<00:03:32.739> mixing<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.189> this<00:03:33.340> hand<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:33.760> not<00:03:33.939> a<00:03:34.000> brush

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
me mixing with this hand and not a brush

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.300 
me mixing with this hand and not a brush
it's<00:03:35.140> going<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.379> be<00:03:35.469> a<00:03:35.500> little<00:03:35.620> bit<00:03:35.739> clumpy<00:03:36.069> but

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it's going to be a little bit clumpy but

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
it's going to be a little bit clumpy but
that<00:03:36.430> doesn't<00:03:36.700> matter<00:03:36.760> anyways<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.109> you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
that doesn't matter anyways so if you

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.330 
that doesn't matter anyways so if you
want<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:39.430> can<00:03:39.609> heat<00:03:39.879> it<00:03:39.909> up<00:03:40.170> um<00:03:41.189> which<00:03:42.189> is

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
want to you can heat it up um which is

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.509 
want to you can heat it up um which is
probably<00:03:42.609> what<00:03:42.959> I'll<00:03:43.959> do<00:03:44.319> so<00:03:44.889> heated<00:03:45.189> up<00:03:45.280> for

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
probably what I'll do so heated up for

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.209 
probably what I'll do so heated up for
like<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:46.079> couple<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.319> minutes<00:03:47.409> probably<00:03:48.069> a

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.219 
like a couple of minutes probably a

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.970 
like a couple of minutes probably a
couple<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.519> seconds<00:03:48.849> actually<00:03:49.889> because<00:03:50.889> you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
couple of seconds actually because you

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.110 
couple of seconds actually because you
don't<00:03:51.129> want<00:03:51.159> it<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.489> too<00:03:51.549> hot<00:03:51.849> where<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
don't want it to get too hot where it

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.339 
don't want it to get too hot where it
burns<00:03:52.299> your<00:03:52.450> hair<00:03:52.659> and<00:03:52.840> then<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.109> can<00:03:53.260> apply

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
burns your hair and then you can apply

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.440 
burns your hair and then you can apply
and<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.799> can<00:03:53.920> put<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.189> in<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.609> applicator

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
and you can put it in a applicator

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
and you can put it in a applicator
bottle<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:55.989> it's<00:03:56.139> easier<00:03:56.530> process<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.549> put<00:03:57.700> it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
bottle so it's easier process to put it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.190 
bottle so it's easier process to put it
into<00:03:57.969> your<00:03:58.000> hair<00:03:58.269> but<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.689> don't<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:59.019> one<00:03:59.139> of

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
into your hair but I don't have one of

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.199 
into your hair but I don't have one of
those<00:03:59.349> so<00:03:59.500> I'm<00:03:59.560> just<00:03:59.680> gonna<00:03:59.879> don't<00:04:00.879> get<00:04:01.030> right

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
those so I'm just gonna don't get right

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.089 
those so I'm just gonna don't get right
into<00:04:01.389> my<00:04:01.569> hair<00:04:01.780> if<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.079> makes<00:04:02.230> any<00:04:02.319> sense<00:04:02.470> I'm

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
into my hair if that makes any sense I'm

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.369 
into my hair if that makes any sense I'm
just<00:04:03.189> going<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.400> put<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.669> in<00:04:03.730> my<00:04:03.879> hair<00:04:04.120> and

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
just going to put it in my hair and

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.099 
just going to put it in my hair and
that's<00:04:05.379> pretty<00:04:05.650> much<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.919> end<00:04:06.099> of<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.510> this

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
that's pretty much the end of it so this

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.899 
that's pretty much the end of it so this
should<00:04:08.409> be<00:04:08.439> extremely<00:04:08.889> moisturizing<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:09.819> you

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
should be extremely moisturizing for you

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.240 
should be extremely moisturizing for you
I<00:04:10.090> suggest<00:04:10.540> probably<00:04:10.840> doing<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.109> two<00:04:11.769> times<00:04:11.980> a

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
I suggest probably doing it two times a

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.789 
I suggest probably doing it two times a
week<00:04:12.459> if<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.599> have<00:04:13.750> time<00:04:13.989> for<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.260> but<00:04:14.560> as<00:04:14.680> you

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
week if you have time for it but as you

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
can see on my hand it is extremely

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.550
