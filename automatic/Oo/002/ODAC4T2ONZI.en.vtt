00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.040
 inventory 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 so then let me tell you how it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.350
 set and after we start looking 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 mod itself and so that you install it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.779
 need to download it from the site archive and all that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.449
 you need it set minecraft 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.400
 maykravt 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 naturally open the archive with this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.489
 mod throw it into the mods folder and all 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.460
 please run the game and play everything 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 very simple all you need is a micro 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 forge and here is your well let's get down to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 most review mod and so if we click 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.800
 on her and saw that in the inverter I'm full 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 srach let's we arrange everything ok 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 In line as it will be more convenient to us I think 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 than so everything we look for we click on 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.149
 r de english english r key 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 we have a relocator then when you click 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.600
 heard such a click i can't even 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.619
 say exactly what you yourself know so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.860
 do we have a mod menu setting 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.229
 here as you see small such a menu 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 and all I can say is that itâ€™s better not 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.460
 press because it reveals 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
 the browser there is a file that describes all 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 This is but if you are interested in the main 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 what the game is this let's 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.619
 let's see lies sorting you can 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 replace it calmly any other you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 convenient auto substitute auto key 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 substitution can both enable so 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 turn off by the way when you hover on 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.619
 key you short description show 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.329
 when auto substitution when we break 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.540
 the subject of this a little later show 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.150
 let's even now 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.480
 you have a broken item 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 Dalaman is automatically taken from you. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.230
 new it was another one the same old 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.420
 mod but not about him now and here 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.340
 such a function is wonderful too 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.380
 if we will let's try it now 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.860
 once again srach click on the middle button 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680
 mice 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.330
 We also have an inventory 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.580
 moving but it can also me 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.960
 disable the keyboard shortcut let's 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.490
 look at the shortcut but I wouldn't 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.390
 I will go into details you also 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 can turn off 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.450
 either you are looking to do here you read the list 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.820
 please so replace before breaking something 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.230
 have the same could do shovel but 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.390
 she would automatically by me take you on 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.160
 new or not broke either like this 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.630
 working let's see 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.290
 Extra options 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.420
 including sound that's when you press a sound from 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.650
 you have well you heard learned how the throne 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.080
 say you can you go out 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.770
 is hanging 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.700
 auth and putting on armor in essentially you 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.500
 make your reservation with us immediately on you 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.040
 worn but here you are written upstairs 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.150
 important on the floor n servers author substitution and 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 auto-key right not 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 is often mistaken for fraud 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.330
 there are on pvp servers they are prohibited 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.950
 these functions but i think the mod works like this 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.040
 that when you go to the server this one 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.610
 the function disappears this happens maybe 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.780
 No, but I did not go to the server did not check 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.150
 You can write in the comments calmly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.739
 is it true or not sorting 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.120
 lifting that is well written 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.330
 avoids filling 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.459
 bar move with all hotbar is lower bar 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.290
 which you naturally see us you 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.580
 menu it will not be filled if you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.290
 pick what he will throw you 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.620
 inventory is very convenient actually 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.330
 because when you free way bar 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.400
 usually there too uncomfortable throws off light 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.000
 Button chest Well mate you this 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.130
 will tell 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.110
 you can also disable let's 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.000
 turn on kind of interesting movement 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.950
 items on the server let's read 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.690
 a brief description of the use 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.210
 server assistance to move the subject 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.180
 while sorting I do this to you 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.220
 I can not say what it means and how it 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.200
 I think you can understand yourself 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.550
 and now let's get past the last 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.140
 it is also added to my 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.280
 sorting chests let's we are with you 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.180
 just throw it and everything in the chest a little bit 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.580
 turn over 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.130
 and see here naturally we have 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.350
 also the menu keys are all the same and more 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.970
 the three keys z is normal sorting 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.280
 so as not to press on the river because when 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.860
 pressed nothing happens on the middle 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.630
 mouse button it works if we click 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.110
 also the key is exactly the same 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.580
 fold also you can fold 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.730
 across the column sorting 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.150
 also called can i go back but i 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.590
 I don't know how exactly it works, but 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.940
 it seems strange to me but maybe 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.410
 she has some kind of regularity in this 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.660
 you can figure it out 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.380
 there are also internally files there everything will be 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.230
 to be told 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.060
 she is a mod himself finished and was with you 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.360
 kombat subscribe to the channel put 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.660
 Huskies and download the mod and play all 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.660
 good luck
