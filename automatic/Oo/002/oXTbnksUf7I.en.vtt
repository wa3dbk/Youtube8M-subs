three-and-a-half millimeter plug on the
end<00:01:38.700> already<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.780> need<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> buy<00:01:40.140> an

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
end already so you don't need to buy an

end already so you don't need to buy an
adapter<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.920> was<00:01:41.370> thinking<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
adapter I was thinking was a like a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
adapter I was thinking was a like a
normal<00:01:42.720> shotgun<00:01:43.110> mic<00:01:43.260> came<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.620> an<00:01:43.740> XLR<00:01:44.190> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
normal shotgun mic came with an XLR to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.460 
normal shotgun mic came with an XLR to
quarter-inch<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.480> I<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.690> need<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:45.960> adapter

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
quarter-inch and I would need an adapter

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
quarter-inch and I would need an adapter
but<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> doesn't<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
but it doesn't it actually is a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
but it doesn't it actually is a
permanent<00:01:48.630> cord<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:50.100> attached<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.570> 3.5

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
permanent cord and is attached to a 3.5

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
permanent cord and is attached to a 3.5
millimeter<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.610> made<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.030> video

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
millimeter and it's made for video

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.180 
millimeter and it's made for video
cameras<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.110> DSLRs

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
cameras and DSLRs

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.430 
cameras and DSLRs
so<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.970> won't<00:01:57.120> need<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.300> buy<00:01:57.510> that<00:01:57.780> adapter

point of testing this plugging that into
the<00:04:06.000> 7d<00:04:06.570> it's<00:04:06.810> probably<00:04:07.260> gonna<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.650> pretty

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the 7d it's probably gonna be pretty

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.449 
the 7d it's probably gonna be pretty
similar<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.760> sound<00:04:09.180> since<00:04:09.930> we're<00:04:10.459> going

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
similar and sound since we're going

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.240 
similar and sound since we're going
through<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.730> cable<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:13.260> don't<00:04:13.980> need<00:04:14.160> to

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
through a cable here so don't need to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.880 
through a cable here so don't need to
really<00:04:14.520> do<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.820> I'll<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.470> ok<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.799> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
really do that I'll think ok just a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.110 
really do that I'll think ok just a
couple<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.250> notes<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.640> wanted<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.940> give<00:04:18.090> you

does come with three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:04:23.190> jack<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> don't<00:04:23.790> need<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.000> buy

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.310 
outside there it is not a shock mount
though<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.330> you'll<00:04:45.450> probably<00:04:45.600> want<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.020> buy<00:04:46.290> a

three or four twenty times and come to
realize<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.680> obviously<00:05:34.680> for<00:05:34.890> 50<00:05:35.160> bucks<00:05:35.370> it's

filters on it and it it actually cleans

filters on it and it it actually cleans
up<00:05:55.519> really<00:05:55.849> nice<00:05:56.029> so<00:05:56.209> you<00:05:56.269> can<00:05:56.300> get<00:05:56.479> some<00:05:56.629> good

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:56.809 
up really nice so you can get some good

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:58.749 
up really nice so you can get some good
audio<00:05:57.169> out<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.529> it<00:05:57.649> I<00:05:57.860> haven't<00:05:58.429> really<00:05:58.580> tested

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
audio out of it I haven't really tested

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.609 
audio out of it I haven't really tested
by<00:05:59.089> booming<00:05:59.449> any<00:05:59.569> actors<00:05:59.959> that<00:06:00.110> were<00:06:00.229> speaking

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:00.619 
by booming any actors that were speaking

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:02.290 
by booming any actors that were speaking
low<00:06:00.800> or<00:06:01.009> anything<00:06:01.279> like<00:06:01.429> that<00:06:01.459> yet<00:06:01.819> so<00:06:01.879> that's

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
low or anything like that yet so that's

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.540 
low or anything like that yet so that's
probably<00:06:02.599> something<00:06:03.349> I<00:06:03.619> will<00:06:04.039> need<00:06:04.189> to<00:06:04.309> do<00:06:04.429> in

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
probably something I will need to do in

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.189 
probably something I will need to do in
the<00:06:04.639> future<00:06:04.789> to<00:06:04.999> test<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.419> out<00:06:05.539> other<00:06:06.169> than

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
the future to test it out other than

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.659 
the future to test it out other than
that<00:06:06.379> I<00:06:06.409> think<00:06:06.679> it's<00:06:06.769> actually<00:06:07.069> a<00:06:07.099> pretty<00:06:07.309> good

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
that I think it's actually a pretty good

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.899 
that I think it's actually a pretty good
