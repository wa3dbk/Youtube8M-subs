and I kind of have made an edited
version<00:00:30.500> of<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.180> Minecraft<00:00:32.660> for<00:00:32.989> wiki's

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
version of the Minecraft for wiki's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.979 
version of the Minecraft for wiki's
version<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.220> this<00:00:34.399> that's<00:00:35.360> where<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.630> usually

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
version of this that's where I usually

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.490 
version of this that's where I usually
get<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.380> lot<00:00:36.500> much<00:00:36.739> a<00:00:36.800> Taurus<00:00:37.250> based<00:00:37.460> off<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
get a lot much a Taurus based off of and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.490 
get a lot much a Taurus based off of and
yes<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:39.769> this<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.160> partly<00:00:41.000> customized<00:00:41.780> what

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
yes so this is partly customized what

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.720 
yes so this is partly customized what
I've<00:00:42.620> done<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.859> bit<00:00:43.039> differently<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.550> I've

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
I've done a bit differently is I've

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.959 
I've done a bit differently is I've
changed<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.840> way<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.739> sizing<00:00:46.340> works<00:00:46.370> and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
changed the way the sizing works and

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.389 
changed the way the sizing works and
I've<00:00:47.059> changed<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.690> way<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.230> collecting<00:00:48.920> work

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
I've changed the way the collecting work

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.419 
I've changed the way the collecting work
so<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:51.109> will<00:00:51.230> all<00:00:51.320> make<00:00:51.440> sense<00:00:51.500> once<00:00:52.010> i<00:00:52.399> er

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
so I that will all make sense once i er

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.049 
so I that will all make sense once i er
build<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:53.539> show<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.839> off<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:54.769> let<00:00:55.339> me<00:00:55.370> to

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
build it and show it off so let me to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.430 
build it and show it off so let me to
begin<00:00:56.300> with<00:00:56.449> show<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.929> what's<00:00:57.199> going<00:00:57.379> to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
happen here so this is gonna make that

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.489 
happen here so this is gonna make that
water<00:01:02.239> come<00:01:02.510> out<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.870> then<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:03.199> going<00:01:03.409> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
comes out and it's not a hundred percent

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.080 
comes out and it's not a hundred percent
perfect<00:01:11.120> but<00:01:11.330> for<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.570> most<00:01:11.720> part<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.560> is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
perfect but for the most part it is

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.640 
perfect but for the most part it is
alright<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.450> let<00:01:14.660> me<00:01:14.780> just<00:01:14.960> go<00:01:15.140> ahead<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.350> turn

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
alright so let me just go ahead and turn

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.230 
alright so let me just go ahead and turn
that<00:01:15.830> off<00:01:15.980> now<00:01:17.350> okay<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.160> there<00:01:19.670> we<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.970> left

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
that off now okay so there we are left

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.970 
that off now okay so there we are left
her<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.420> few<00:01:20.600> remnants<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.530> know<00:01:21.650> that's

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
her a few remnants but you know that's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.420 
her a few remnants but you know that's
to<00:01:22.160> be<00:01:22.250> expected<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.970> would<00:01:23.420> guess<00:01:23.870> I<00:01:24.170> mean<00:01:24.430> it's

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
to be expected I would guess I mean it's

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.980 
to be expected I would guess I mean it's
not<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:26.060> not<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:26.480> I<00:01:26.510> said<00:01:26.720> there's<00:01:26.870> one

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
not it's not like I said there's one

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.360 
not it's not like I said there's one
hundred<00:01:27.200> percent<00:01:27.230> perfect<00:01:27.830> but<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.220> know<00:01:28.340> I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
hundred percent perfect but you know I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.650 
hundred percent perfect but you know I
believe<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.510> has<00:01:29.660> a<00:01:30.040> good<00:01:31.040> promise<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.480> do<00:01:32.630> so

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
believe it has a good promise to do so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.220 
believe it has a good promise to do so
in<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.050> future<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.760> usually<00:01:34.870> this<00:01:35.870> will<00:01:36.080> now

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
in the future so usually this will now

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.700 
in the future so usually this will now
collect<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.710> here<00:01:36.980> wheat<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.960> end<00:01:39.110> one's<00:01:39.380> much

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
collect in here wheat the end one's much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.480 
collect in here wheat the end one's much
more<00:01:39.980> popular<00:01:40.790> as<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:41.870> see<00:01:42.050> 24<00:01:42.980> seeds<00:01:43.220> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
more popular as you can see 24 seeds and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.530 
more popular as you can see 24 seeds and
full<00:01:43.670> teen<00:01:43.880> way<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.180> what's<00:01:44.330> basically

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
full teen way and what's basically

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.450 
full teen way and what's basically
happened<00:01:45.050> here<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.890> has<00:01:45.980> gone<00:01:46.160> straight

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
happened here is it has gone straight

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.250 
happened here is it has gone straight
into<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.730> hopper<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.810> hoppers<00:01:48.080> gone

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
into the hopper and the hoppers gone

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.590 
into the hopper and the hoppers gone
straight<00:01:48.470> into<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.680> chest<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:50.390> water

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
straight into the chest so the water

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.570 
straight into the chest so the water
pushes<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.230> straight<00:01:51.680> into<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.340> it's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
pushes it straight into there and it's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.190 
pushes it straight into there and it's
an<00:01:52.730> automated<00:01:53.060> collection<00:01:53.330> system<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.170> as

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
an automated collection system so as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.530 
an automated collection system so as
well<00:01:54.410> as<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.620> being<00:01:54.650> an<00:01:54.890> automated<00:01:55.430> get<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.420> off

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
well as it being an automated get it off

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.860 
well as it being an automated get it off
system<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.710> know<00:01:57.830> whatever<00:01:58.660> routing<00:01:59.660> off<00:01:59.780> the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
system you know whatever routing off the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.350 
system you know whatever routing off the
ground<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.260> also<00:02:00.500> collects<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.040> as<00:02:01.160> well<00:02:01.360> so

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
ground it also collects it as well so

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840 
ground it also collects it as well so

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
there so to start off building one of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.820 
there so to start off building one of
these<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:08.989> what<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:09.560> here

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
is make a seven by seven whole three

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
is make a seven by seven whole three
blocks<00:02:13.129> down<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.080> i'll<00:02:15.080> show<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
blocks down and i'll show that up on the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.090 
blocks down and i'll show that up on the
screen<00:02:16.220> here

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
screen here

off<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.550> want<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> put<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> piston<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
off we want to put a piston in here and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.890 
off we want to put a piston in here and
we<00:02:53.190> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.400> put<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> lever<00:02:53.880> or<00:02:54.180> some<00:02:54.600> sort<00:02:54.810> of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
set it to the on state so we want it out

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
set it to the on state so we want it out
we<00:03:00.120> want<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.420> out<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.830> water

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
we want it out like this to the water

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.000 
we want it out like this to the water
it's<00:03:02.700> stopped<00:03:03.120> from<00:03:03.540> falling<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:03.960> on<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.860> all

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's stopped from falling down on to all

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.060 
it's stopped from falling down on to all
this<00:03:05.400> farm<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.560> want<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> take

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
this farm and so now you want to take

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.740 
this farm and so now you want to take
your<00:03:08.280> dirt<00:03:08.520> or<00:03:08.730> whatever<00:03:09.150> your<00:03:09.480> glass

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
your dirt or whatever your glass

your dirt or whatever your glass
whatever<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.680> put<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.070> put<00:03:11.940> a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
whatever you want to put and put a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.680 
whatever you want to put and put a
little<00:03:12.510> ring<00:03:13.320> around<00:03:13.590> hit<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.360> there

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
little ring around hit like that there

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.530 
little ring around hit like that there
we<00:03:15.810> go<00:03:15.990> right<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.970> water<00:03:18.180> done

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
we go right so that's the water done

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
we go right so that's the water done
because<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.740> put<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.130> there

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
because now you just put that in there

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
because now you just put that in there
and<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.150> flick<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.810> will<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.050> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and when you flick that it will do this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.180 
and when you flick that it will do this
and<00:03:23.270> yeah<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.170> basic<00:03:25.530> concept<00:03:26.010> for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
and yeah that is the basic concept for

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.070 
and yeah that is the basic concept for
the<00:03:26.280> water<00:03:26.490> pot<00:03:27.560> after<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.550> want<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the water pot after that you want to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.280 
the water pot after that you want to
don't<00:03:31.080> till<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.980> dirt<00:03:32.370> first<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:33.290> mean

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
don't till this dirt first I mean

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
don't till this dirt first I mean
because<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.800> will<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.070> go<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.520> up<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
because it will just go back up in the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.330 
because it will just go back up in the
end<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.900> what<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.740> first<00:03:38.040> before

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
end so what I like to do first before

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.760 
end so what I like to do first before
that<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.910> dig<00:03:39.180> under<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.900> put<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> water

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
that is dig under here and put a water

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.730 
that is dig under here and put a water
block<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.780> hopefully<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.960> mean<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.350> don't<00:03:43.560> know

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
block and hopefully I mean I don't know

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.030 
block and hopefully I mean I don't know
it's<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> bit<00:03:44.340> funny<00:03:44.880> water<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.040> farmland

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it's all a bit funny water and farmland

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.310 
it's all a bit funny water and farmland
in<00:03:47.310> Minecraft<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.120> hopefully<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.260> will

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
in Minecraft but hopefully that will

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.970 
in Minecraft but hopefully that will
keep<00:03:49.560> these<00:03:50.130> blocks<00:03:50.400> hydrated<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:52.170> mean<00:03:52.860> you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
keep these blocks hydrated so mean you

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.010 
keep these blocks hydrated so mean you
can<00:03:53.220> ho<00:03:53.460> it<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.910> want<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> basic

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
can ho it if you want to get you a basic

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.400 
can ho it if you want to get you a basic
outline<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.340> don't<00:03:56.580> want<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.300> hold<00:03:57.510> these<00:03:58.080> end

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
outline you don't want to hold these end

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.180 
outline you don't want to hold these end
lines<00:03:58.980> here<00:03:59.510> otherwise<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:01.350> doesn't<00:04:01.830> reach

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
lines here otherwise it doesn't reach

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.330 
lines here otherwise it doesn't reach
properly<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.420> messes<00:04:04.110> up<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.500> bit<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.980> I've

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
properly and it messes up a bit so I've

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.040 
properly and it messes up a bit so I've
had<00:04:05.730> from<00:04:05.910> experience<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.570> tends<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.960> be

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
had from experience it tends to be

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.520 
had from experience it tends to be
better<00:04:07.430> using<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.760> sort<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.870> lay<00:04:10.050> out<00:04:10.080> here

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
better using this sort of lay out here

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.490 
better using this sort of lay out here
this<00:04:10.890> layout<00:04:11.700> here<00:04:12.000> ok<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.230> next<00:04:13.290> thing

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
this layout here ok so the next thing

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.470 
this layout here ok so the next thing
you<00:04:13.650> want<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.940> hopper<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
you want to do is for the hopper you

want to go down to here and you want to
take<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.930> block<00:04:19.109> out<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.950> block<00:04:20.250> this

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
take that block out this block this

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.300 
take that block out this block this
block<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.570> block<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.290> block<00:04:22.560> go<00:04:23.100> into

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
block this block and this block go into

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.060 
block this block and this block go into
here<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.720> want<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.990> dig<00:04:25.229> just<00:04:25.860> up

the surface up here

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.700 
the surface up here
alright<00:04:30.210> then<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.389> want<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.599> dig<00:04:31.810> one<00:04:32.380> more

alright then you want to dig one more
down<00:04:32.949> here<00:04:33.009> and<00:04:33.699> then<00:04:34.599> repeat<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.800> same<00:04:36.069> there

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
down here and then repeat the same there

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.210 
down here and then repeat the same there
we<00:04:36.550> go<00:04:36.729> okay<00:04:37.360> good<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.259> we<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.680> like<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:38.949> place

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
we go okay good so we have like a place

we go okay good so we have like a place
to<00:04:39.400> walk<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.910> all<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.710> here<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.860> where

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
to walk and all that and here is where

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.070 
to walk and all that and here is where
your<00:04:42.370> chest<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.849> going<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.630> take<00:04:43.870> your

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
your chest is going to be so take your

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.890 
your chest is going to be so take your
chest<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.740> now<00:04:45.729> put<00:04:46.120> get<00:04:46.300> your<00:04:46.419> hopper<00:04:46.630> and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
chest and now put get your hopper and

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.499 
chest and now put get your hopper and
now<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.949> is<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.280> most<00:04:48.520> important<00:04:49.150> part<00:04:49.180> of

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
now this is the most important part of

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.999 
now this is the most important part of
the<00:04:49.690> hopper<00:04:49.870> process<00:04:50.349> you<00:04:50.530> need<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.770> hold

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
the hopper process you need to hold

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.790 
the hopper process you need to hold
shift<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.789> right<00:04:52.630> click<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.440> chest

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
shift and right click it on the chest

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.740 
shift and right click it on the chest
this<00:04:54.370> will<00:04:54.550> actually<00:04:54.729> connect<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.539> hopper

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
this will actually connect to the hopper

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.080 
this will actually connect to the hopper
to<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.050> chest<00:04:56.410> so<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.280> hopper<00:04:57.460> can<00:04:57.759> actually

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
to the chest so the hopper can actually

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.050 
to the chest so the hopper can actually
directly<00:04:58.479> feed<00:04:58.840> stuff<00:04:59.289> into<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.770> chest<00:05:00.060> so

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
directly feed stuff into the chest so

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.480 
directly feed stuff into the chest so
let<00:05:01.419> me<00:05:01.449> give<00:05:01.599> an<00:05:01.720> example<00:05:01.889> let<00:05:02.889> me<00:05:02.979> throw<00:05:03.220> my

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
let me give an example let me throw my

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.029 
let me give an example let me throw my
home<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.479> there<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.930> go<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.409> it<00:05:05.680> appears

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
home in there you go and it appears

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.830 
home in there you go and it appears
right<00:05:06.639> back<00:05:06.819> in<00:05:06.970> there<00:05:07.150> that's<00:05:07.360> what<00:05:07.569> you<00:05:07.630> want

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
right back in there that's what you want

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.300 
right back in there that's what you want
otherwise<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.409> will<00:05:08.470> just<00:05:08.530> collect<00:05:08.919> in<00:05:09.099> here

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
otherwise it will just collect in here

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.430 
otherwise it will just collect in here
and<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.720> weren't<00:05:10.840> there<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.080> reach<00:05:11.229> it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
and you weren't there to reach it

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.469 
and you weren't there to reach it
because<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:12.159> next<00:05:12.430> part<00:05:12.699> you<00:05:12.880> need<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.150> do<00:05:13.300> is

coming<00:05:36.460> in<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.759> allows<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.509> get<00:05:37.659> chest

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
coming in and allows you to get chest

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.620 
coming in and allows you to get chest
access<00:05:38.860> because<00:05:39.070> otherwise<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:40.389> can't

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
access because otherwise you can't

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.409 
access because otherwise you can't
access<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:41.169> chest<00:05:41.440> with<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.710> block<00:05:41.889> here

access the chest with a block here

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.580

travels<00:06:54.440> that<00:06:55.040> way<00:06:55.250> we<00:06:56.180> see<00:06:56.360> we've<00:06:56.480> got<00:06:56.510> a

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
travels that way we see we've got a

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.870 
travels that way we see we've got a
stray<00:06:56.900> seeds<00:06:57.260> there<00:06:57.620> but<00:06:57.920> you<00:06:58.070> know<00:06:58.100> if<00:06:58.670> when

here<00:07:22.670> so<00:07:23.390> on<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:23.720> edge<00:07:23.840> we<00:07:24.710> have<00:07:24.890> one<00:07:25.160> here

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
here so on the edge we have one here

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.190 
here so on the edge we have one here
thats<00:07:26.240> collecting<00:07:26.480> a<00:07:26.810> lot<00:07:26.840> and<00:07:28.540> so<00:07:29.540> is<00:07:29.810> this

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
thats collecting a lot and so is this
