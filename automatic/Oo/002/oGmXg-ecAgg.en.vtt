but<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.170> cooking<00:01:07.560> anymore<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
but not cooking anymore so this now is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.260 
but not cooking anymore so this now is
going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> cook<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:09.930> probably<00:01:10.890> another

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
going to cook for probably another

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
going to cook for probably another
minute<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> half<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
minute and a half and then I'm going to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.580 
minute and a half and then I'm going to
flip<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.250> over<00:01:14.600> because<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.780> concerned<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
flip it over because I'm concerned that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
flip it over because I'm concerned that
this<00:01:16.740> may<00:01:16.950> break<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.790> always<00:01:17.880> good<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this may break up it's always good to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.730 
this may break up it's always good to
use<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.380> sure<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
use one of these and just make sure that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
use one of these and just make sure that
if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.070> run<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> run<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> along<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
if you do run it you run it along the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.929 
if you do run it you run it along the
grill<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.470> rather<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.729> way

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
grill this way rather than that way

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
grill this way rather than that way
which<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.540> harder<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> work<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.200> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
which is a lot harder to work with but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
which is a lot harder to work with but
that<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.460> underneath<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that way you can just get underneath it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.280 
that way you can just get underneath it
and<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.710> turn<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.310> round<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:31.020> I've

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and then just turn it round and if I've

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.539 
and then just turn it round and if I've
still<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.740> tongs<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.259> can<00:01:34.259> still<00:01:34.549> put

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
still got my tongs here I can still put

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
still got my tongs here I can still put
that<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> satisfy

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.950 
the cut of meat that we're cooking which
is<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.320> brisket<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.729> comes<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> belly

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is the brisket it comes from the belly

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
is the brisket it comes from the belly
really<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really and if you think about it the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
really and if you think about it the
belly<00:01:53.759> didn't<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> great<00:01:54.450> deal<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
belly didn't do a great deal I think

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.209 
belly didn't do a great deal I think
it's<00:01:56.460> probably<00:01:56.640> best<00:01:57.360> served<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> stew<00:01:58.920> or

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's probably best served as a stew or

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.760 
it's probably best served as a stew or
by<00:01:59.670> salting<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> boiling<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.170> soul<00:02:01.469> beef

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
by salting it and boiling it a soul beef

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
by salting it and boiling it a soul beef
I<00:02:02.009> mean<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> most<00:02:02.790> traditional<00:02:03.030> way

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I mean that's the most traditional way

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
I mean that's the most traditional way
of<00:02:03.509> cooking<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> does<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
of cooking it but it does you know I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
of cooking it but it does you know I
think<00:02:05.189> any<00:02:05.460> meat<00:02:05.729> works<00:02:05.939> nicely<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.719> been

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
think any meat works nicely if it's been

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
think any meat works nicely if it's been
charred<00:02:07.170> properly<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.819> to
