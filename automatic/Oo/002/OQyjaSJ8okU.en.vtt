hello and welcome to module this time we

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.340 
hello and welcome to module this time we
have<00:00:02.399> real<00:00:02.610> bowls<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> mud<00:00:04.230> that

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
have real bowls this is a mud that

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.869 
have real bowls this is a mud that
replaces<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.859> models<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.400> most<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
replaces the models of most of the

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
replaces the models of most of the
generic<00:00:06.270> bowls<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.690> game<00:00:06.930> there's<00:00:07.560> 12<00:00:07.830> new

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
generic bowls in the game there's 12 new

the<00:00:12.210> idea<00:00:12.450> behind<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.960> mud<00:00:13.110> comes<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.500> an

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
the idea behind the mud comes from an

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
the idea behind the mud comes from an
author<00:00:13.740> who's<00:00:14.070> also<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.429> craftsman<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.660> his

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
author who's also a craftsman and in his

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.300 
author who's also a craftsman and in his
experience<00:00:16.350> he<00:00:16.500> thought<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> vanilla<00:00:17.100> balls

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
experience he thought the vanilla balls

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.859 
experience he thought the vanilla balls
looked<00:00:17.580> more<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.760> Hollywood<00:00:18.270> props<00:00:18.570> rather

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
looked more like Hollywood props rather

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.929 
looked more like Hollywood props rather
than<00:00:19.140> functional<00:00:19.590> bowls<00:00:19.800> while<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> new

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
than functional bowls while the new

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
than functional bowls while the new
models<00:00:21.270> aim<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> change<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
models aim to change that and the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.050 
models aim to change that and the
authors<00:00:22.800> also<00:00:23.070> taken<00:00:23.369> several<00:00:23.699> other<00:00:23.820> key

points into account when designing the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
points into account when designing the
bowls<00:00:25.820> for<00:00:26.820> example<00:00:27.210> he's<00:00:27.330> taken<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
bowls for example he's taken the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
bowls for example he's taken the
material<00:00:28.260> type<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.619> its<00:00:28.740> origins<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.519> things

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
material type in its origins so things

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
material type in its origins so things
like<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.240> made<00:00:30.449> who<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.019> made<00:00:31.199> by<00:00:31.410> an<00:00:31.650> its

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
like how it's made who is made by an its

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
like how it's made who is made by an its
original<00:00:32.189> purpose<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:33.420> he<00:00:33.540> designed

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
original purpose and then he designed

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.150 
original purpose and then he designed
all<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> balls<00:00:34.500> around<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
all of the balls around all of that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
all of the balls around all of that
information<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:36.899> example<00:00:37.200> let's<00:00:37.469> take

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
information so as an example let's take

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
information so as an example let's take
a<00:00:37.680> look<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> new<00:00:38.190> evany<00:00:38.579> bowl<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
a look at the new evany bowl it's now a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
a look at the new evany bowl it's now a
composite<00:00:40.200> bowl<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> twist<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.340> horn<00:00:41.550> has

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
composite bowl with a twist the horn has

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.040 
composite bowl with a twist the horn has
been<00:00:41.820> replaced<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> strip<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> tempered

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
been replaced with a strip of tempered

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
been replaced with a strip of tempered
evany<00:00:43.350> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.890> wood<00:00:44.129> evany<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
evany instead of just wood evany is a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
evany instead of just wood evany is a
much<00:00:45.329> stronger<00:00:45.629> harder<00:00:46.050> material<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.710> it's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
much stronger harder material but it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
much stronger harder material but it's
also<00:00:46.950> relatively<00:00:47.370> lightweight<00:00:47.730> especially

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
also relatively lightweight especially

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
also relatively lightweight especially
when<00:00:48.840> focused<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> specific<00:00:49.710> area<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

when focused into a specific area of the
bowl<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.000> end<00:00:51.510> result<00:00:51.840> means<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.230> draw<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
bowl the end result means you can draw a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
bowl the end result means you can draw a
further<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:52.949> without<00:00:53.250> snapping<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> bowl

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
further back without snapping the bowl

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
further back without snapping the bowl
allowing<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:54.809> powerful<00:00:55.260> shots<00:00:55.500> now

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
allowing for more powerful shots now

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
allowing for more powerful shots now
we're<00:00:56.489> hardly<00:00:56.760> Bo<00:00:57.000> experts<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.570> craftsmen<00:00:57.989> but

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
we're hardly Bo experts or craftsmen but

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
we're hardly Bo experts or craftsmen but
it<00:00:58.260> does<00:00:58.410> seem<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.710> logical<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.160> focus<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it does seem more logical to focus to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
it does seem more logical to focus to
stronger<00:00:59.940> material<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> certain<00:01:00.809> areas<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
stronger material in certain areas of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
stronger material in certain areas of
the<00:01:01.410> bowl<00:01:01.590> instead<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.460> using<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> single

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the bowl instead of just using a single

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670 
the bowl instead of just using a single
material<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.600> encompass<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> entire<00:01:04.439> bowl

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
material to encompass the entire bowl

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
material to encompass the entire bowl
like<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> vanilla<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.030> models<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.510> steps

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
like in vanilla the models have steps

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
like in vanilla the models have steps
away<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> vanilla<00:01:07.500> design<00:01:07.920> where<00:01:08.189> the

away from the vanilla design where the

all know that the elven bow is very

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
all know that the elven bow is very
sleek<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.540> stylish<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.259> also<00:01:16.740> made<00:01:16.920> from

moonstone and Quicksilver those design

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960 
moonstone and Quicksilver those design
choices<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.770> key<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> elven<00:01:20.490> weapon<00:01:20.790> type

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
choices are key to the elven weapon type

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
choices are key to the elven weapon type
so<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> ball<00:01:21.659> sticks<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> even<00:01:22.409> though<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so the ball sticks to it even though it

so the ball sticks to it even though it
might<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> most<00:01:23.250> practical<00:01:23.580> ball

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

Daedric bowl it's similar in
construction<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.090> an<00:02:51.300> ebony<00:02:51.540> bowl<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:52.050> the

Ebony's treated with the Daedra heart

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.699 
Ebony's treated with the Daedra heart
which<00:02:53.880> caused<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> crack<00:02:54.660> Dave<00:02:55.350> Rio<00:02:55.500> blood

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
which caused it to crack Dave Rio blood

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.810 
which caused it to crack Dave Rio blood
then<00:02:55.860> seeps<00:02:56.130> through<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> cracks<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
then seeps through the cracks and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.580 
then seeps through the cracks and
solidifies<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> heat<00:02:57.720> creating<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.440> much

solidifies in the heat creating a much

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.500

more rigid let still flexible material
it's<00:03:01.020> also<00:03:01.230> said<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> sinew<00:03:02.160> used<00:03:02.400> to

enhance the bowl actually comes from
fallen<00:03:04.080> Daedra<00:03:04.470> instead<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.070> animal<00:03:05.400> so

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
fallen Daedra instead of an animal so

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.640 
fallen Daedra instead of an animal so
the<00:03:06.270> bowls<00:03:06.480> themselves<00:03:06.930> contain<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> Vistage

each one rare and unique it's also

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.890 
each one rare and unique it's also
important<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.030> keep<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.330> mind<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.750> although
