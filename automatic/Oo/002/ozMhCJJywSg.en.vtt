first so if I want to maneuver my pump

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.250 
first so if I want to maneuver my pump
this<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.209> inch<00:02:48.360> or<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.020> way<00:02:49.170> an

inch or two I still have the flexibility

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.380 
inch or two I still have the flexibility
to<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.280> as<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.760> come<00:02:53.940> out<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.180> top

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
to do that as I as I come out of the top

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.960 
to do that as I as I come out of the top
of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.599> pump<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.310> am<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> use<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
of the pump I do I am going to use a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.520 
of the pump I do I am going to use a
fast<00:02:57.360> 90<00:02:59.360> this<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> street<00:03:00.780> 90<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.349> one's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
fast 90 this is a street 90 this one's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.830 
fast 90 this is a street 90 this one's
going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> glue<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:03.330> simply

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
going to glue right in it's simply

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.500 
going to glue right in it's simply
because<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.410> my<00:03:04.980> inlet<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.519> my<00:03:05.640> filter<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.269> down

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
because my my inlet to my filter is down

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.390 
because my my inlet to my filter is down
pretty<00:03:06.840> low<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.650> want<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.310> as

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
pretty low so I want to get to it as

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.430 
pretty low so I want to get to it as
fast<00:03:08.640> as<00:03:08.819> possible<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.019> am<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.380> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
fast as possible but I am going to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880 
fast as possible but I am going to
install<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.709> check<00:03:11.069> valve<00:03:11.099> here<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:13.680> talked

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
install a check valve here we talked

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.340 
install a check valve here we talked
about<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> check<00:03:14.310> valve<00:03:14.340> earlier<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:16.230> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
about the check valve earlier in a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.990 
about the check valve earlier in a
perfect<00:03:16.620> world<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.250> my<00:03:17.430> check<00:03:17.640> valves<00:03:17.940> in

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
perfect world I like my check valves in

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.850 
perfect world I like my check valves in
a<00:03:18.060> vertical<00:03:18.360> orientation<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.650> know<00:03:19.739> that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
a vertical orientation so you know that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.590 
a vertical orientation so you know that
flapper<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.610> like<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.420> water

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
flapper is going like this the water

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.350 
flapper is going like this the water
presses<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> flapper<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> down<00:03:23.100> mode<00:03:23.400> but

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
presses the flapper in the down mode but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.990 
presses the flapper in the down mode but
sometimes<00:03:24.870> we're<00:03:25.049> forced<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.440> go<00:03:26.000> horizontal

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
sometimes we're forced to go horizontal

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.059 
sometimes we're forced to go horizontal
and<00:03:27.390> that's<00:03:28.019> okay<00:03:28.380> but<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.680> want<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> make

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
and that's okay but you want to make

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.250 
and that's okay but you want to make
sure<00:03:29.099> actually<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.790> check<00:03:30.000> valve<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:31.049> check

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
sure actually the check valve the check

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.350 
sure actually the check valve the check
valves<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.530> use<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.799> says<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.130> side<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.239> if

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
valves we use it says this side up so if

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.330 
valves we use it says this side up so if
you<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.989> horizontal<00:03:34.470> fashion<00:03:34.620> you

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
you do it in a horizontal fashion you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.160 
you do it in a horizontal fashion you
want<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.580> make<00:03:35.700> sure<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.630> check<00:03:36.870> valve<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
want to make sure the check valve is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.500 
want to make sure the check valve is
hanging<00:03:37.620> down<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:38.459> it's<00:03:38.670> upside<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
hanging down if it's upside down and the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720 
hanging down if it's upside down and the
check<00:03:39.750> valve<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:40.290> loose<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.580> once

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
check valve is loose like that and once

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.970 
check valve is loose like that and once
the<00:03:41.819> hang<00:03:42.000> open<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.739> we're<00:03:43.890> going

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
the hang open so in this one we're going

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.140 
the hang open so in this one we're going
to<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.160> ahead<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.609> installed<00:03:45.000> like

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
to go ahead and get this installed like

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.910 
to go ahead and get this installed like
so<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:45.959> why<00:03:46.109> our<00:03:46.260> check<00:03:46.470> valve<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.799> in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
so so that's why our check valve is in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.400 
so so that's why our check valve is in
this<00:03:47.010> horizontal<00:03:47.280> approach<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
this horizontal approach and then the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.880 
this horizontal approach and then the
tee<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.890> go<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:51.049> or<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.590> three

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
tee is going to go on or that the three

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.039 
tee is going to go on or that the three
way<00:03:53.040> valve<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.579> tee<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.510> control

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
way valve is a tee and so that I control

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.809 
way valve is a tee and so that I control
the<00:03:55.140> flow<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> either<00:03:55.650> way<00:03:55.829> this<00:03:56.370> one's<00:03:56.609> going

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the flow to either way this one's going

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.099 
the flow to either way this one's going
to<00:03:56.850> shoot<00:03:57.030> out<00:03:57.120> towards<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.569> waterfall<00:03:57.959> and

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
to shoot out towards the waterfall and

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.020 
to shoot out towards the waterfall and
this<00:03:58.260> one<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.920> head<00:03:59.100> towards<00:03:59.430> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
this one is going to head towards the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.890 
this one is going to head towards the
this<00:04:00.810> filtration<00:04:01.140> system<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.750> I'm<00:04:03.750> gonna

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
this filtration system here so I'm gonna

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.940 
this filtration system here so I'm gonna
go<00:04:04.019> ahead<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.170> start<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.470> glue<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.769> guy

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
go ahead and start to glue this guy

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.790 
go ahead and start to glue this guy
together

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:36.340 

you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.750 

okay<00:04:37.350> essentially<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.980> but<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.310> pond<00:04:38.520> pump

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
okay essentially the but the pond pump

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.250 
okay essentially the but the pond pump
has<00:04:38.880> been<00:04:38.910> installed<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.570> ready<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.840> go<00:04:40.050> I

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
has been installed and ready to go I

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.320 
has been installed and ready to go I
want<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.740> give<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.010> one<00:04:41.190> tip<00:04:41.460> when<00:04:42.210> you're

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
want to give you one tip when you're

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.580 
want to give you one tip when you're
gluing<00:04:42.660> your<00:04:42.930> check<00:04:43.290> valve<00:04:43.530> assembly

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
gluing your check valve assembly

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.400 
gluing your check valve assembly
together<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.460> lot<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.030> times<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.390> it's<00:04:45.690> easy

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
together a lot of times it's it's easy

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.680 
together a lot of times it's it's easy
to<00:04:46.650> glue<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.100> Prime<00:04:47.310> like<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:47.790> push<00:04:48.570> your

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
to glue and Prime like so push your

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.880 
to glue and Prime like so push your
fittings<00:04:48.990> together<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.470> hold<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.770> together

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
fittings together and hold it together

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.620 
fittings together and hold it together
but<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> want<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.940> be<00:04:51.000> careful<00:04:51.210> about<00:04:51.480> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
but I want you to be careful about the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.430 
but I want you to be careful about the
glue<00:04:51.840> dripping<00:04:52.290> down<00:04:52.470> through<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.010> unit<00:04:53.340> and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
glue dripping down through the unit and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.170 
glue dripping down through the unit and
gluing<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:55.620> flap<00:04:55.920> together<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.030> you're

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
gluing that flap together so as you're

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.330 
gluing that flap together so as you're
doing<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.630> gluing<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.470> priming<00:04:58.920> do<00:04:59.220> it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
doing the gluing and priming do it

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.520 
doing the gluing and priming do it
sideways<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.150> make<00:05:00.540> sure<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:01.380> don't

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
sideways and make sure that you don't

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.620 
sideways and make sure that you don't
have<00:05:01.680> any<00:05:01.830> glue<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.490> drip<00:05:03.090> down<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.420> there<00:05:03.540> and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
have any glue and drip down in there and

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.100 
have any glue and drip down in there and
clog<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.200> up<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.670> want<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.570> point<00:05:06.780> out<00:05:06.930> that

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
clog it up so I want to point out that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.960 
clog it up so I want to point out that
we<00:05:07.230> have<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.830> three<00:05:08.010> different<00:05:08.100> unions<00:05:08.820> I

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
we have the three different unions I

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.310 
we have the three different unions I
have<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> union<00:05:09.330> on<00:05:09.540> either<00:05:09.780> side<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.140> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
have a union on either side of the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.410 
have a union on either side of the
priming<00:05:10.710> pot<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.160> then<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:11.700> have<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> union<00:05:12.150> on

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
priming pot and then I have a union on

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.420 
priming pot and then I have a union on
top<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.170> pump<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:13.890> if<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.040> ever<00:05:14.190> need<00:05:14.400> to

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
top of the pump so if you ever need to
