network so it looks like the software is
just<00:02:44.080> loaded<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.680> took<00:02:45.250> her<00:02:45.400> less<00:02:45.670> than<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850

minute there's a slight pause and then

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.250 
minute there's a slight pause and then
the<00:02:48.970> software<00:02:49.270> appears<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.900> it's<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
the software appears and it's just a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.560 
the software appears and it's just a
pity<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.770> screen<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.250> we<00:02:51.490> just

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
pity on the screen there so we just

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.490 
pity on the screen there so we just
minimize<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.690> screen<00:02:52.930> behind<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.320> for<00:02:53.470> a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
minimize the screen behind it for a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.900 
minimize the screen behind it for a
second<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.380> your<00:02:56.620> Mitel<00:02:57.040> 5000<00:02:57.700> phone
