00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
pretty nice figures they are pretty

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.670 
pretty nice figures they are pretty
limited<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.000> their<00:00:39.180> articulation<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.379> being

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
limited on their articulation for being

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
limited on their articulation for being
mini<00:00:40.890> mates<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.820> both<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
mini mates because both of them have the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
mini mates because both of them have the
shoulder<00:00:43.110> pads<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.680> something<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.129> hinders

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
shoulder pads or something that hinders

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
shoulder pads or something that hinders
their<00:00:44.700> shoulders<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.149> their<00:00:45.570> arms<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> move

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
their shoulders for their arms to move

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
their shoulders for their arms to move
around<00:00:46.260> both<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:47.100> figures<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.640> boots

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
around both these figures have boots

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.779 
around both these figures have boots
wristbands<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> helmets<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.460> they're<00:00:50.640> very

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
wristbands and helmets so they're very

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.220 
wristbands and helmets so they're very
similar<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> pretty

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
similar and I think this is a pretty

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
similar and I think this is a pretty
nice<00:00:52.440> 2-pack<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> they

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
nice 2-pack for them to do that they

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
nice 2-pack for them to do that they
each<00:00:54.210> come<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.539> accessories<00:00:54.840> where<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> can

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
each come with accessories where you can

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
each come with accessories where you can
take<00:00:55.680> off<00:00:55.860> their<00:00:56.039> helmets<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.210> on

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
take off their helmets and then put on

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
take off their helmets and then put on
their<00:00:57.629> hair<00:00:57.840> pieces<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
their hair pieces so I'm going to

their hair pieces so I'm going to
quickly<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.250> over<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> articulation<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
quickly go over the articulation and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
quickly go over the articulation and
then<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.899> over<00:01:01.050> some<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> fine<00:01:01.680> details

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then go over some of the fine details

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
then go over some of the fine details
alright<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> Crimson<00:01:04.110> Dynamo

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
alright so here we have Crimson Dynamo

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
alright so here we have Crimson Dynamo
up-close<00:01:05.180> spin<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.299> around<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:08.510> get<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
up-close spin them around for you get a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
up-close spin them around for you get a
look<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.840> his<00:01:09.990> boots<00:01:10.260> they're<00:01:12.650> definitely<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
look at his boots they're definitely the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
look at his boots they're definitely the
shoulder<00:01:14.460> pads<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.030> or<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> shoulder<00:01:15.900> it's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
shoulder pads here or the shoulder it's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469

on his suit definitely make it stand out

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
on his suit definitely make it stand out
so<00:01:18.840> articulation<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> basically<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> can

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
so articulation is basically you can

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.469 
so articulation is basically you can
take<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> Hat

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
pretty good this is where the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
pretty good this is where the
articulation<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> goes<00:01:28.920> awry<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.270> can't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
