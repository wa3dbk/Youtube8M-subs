good about this Canon camera is that
beneath<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> lens<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.420> macro

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
beneath the lens here it has a macro

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
beneath the lens here it has a macro
okay<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> micro<00:01:35.400> lens<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.180> allow

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
okay then a micro lens is going to allow

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.649 
okay then a micro lens is going to allow
you<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> find<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:38.189> fine<00:01:38.610> focus<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> very

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
you to find very very fine focus on very

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
you to find very very fine focus on very
small<00:01:39.990> elements<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.189> perfect<00:01:41.850> for

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
small elements which is perfect for

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
small elements which is perfect for
photographing<00:01:42.659> makeup<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.500> you'll<00:01:44.100> find

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
photographing makeup because you'll find

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.580 
photographing makeup because you'll find
it's<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> texture<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.630> makeup<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.380> going

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it's the texture of the makeup is going

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's the texture of the makeup is going
to<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:46.950> allow<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.399> colours<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.810> pass

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to really allow the colours to you pass

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
to really allow the colours to you pass
through<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.070> people<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
through so that other people can see it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
through so that other people can see it
whereas<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> start<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> lose<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> lot<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
whereas if you start to lose a lot of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
whereas if you start to lose a lot of
the<00:01:52.770> texture<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> blurs<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.689> find

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the texture and it blurs over you find

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
the texture and it blurs over you find
that<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.560> colors<00:01:55.950> aren't<00:01:56.130> coming<00:01:56.399> through

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that the colors aren't coming through

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.980 
that the colors aren't coming through
these<00:01:56.729> textures<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> coming<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
these textures and coming to you you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
these textures and coming to you you're
not<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.320> getting<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> sense<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.159> how<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
not really getting a sense of how the

not really getting a sense of how the
applied<00:02:00.329> makeup<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.960> going

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
more than likely what's going to happen

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.199 
more than likely what's going to happen
is<00:03:00.560> I'm<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> over<00:03:01.220> expose<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.730> shot<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209
