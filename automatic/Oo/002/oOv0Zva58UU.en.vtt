00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:12.240
 welcome today this video I speak to you tel 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.519
 tomtom multisport 1 clock day on 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 160 for a while to approve it 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.439
 obviously a watch that replaces itself 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.519
 to a personal trainer then followed 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.990
 let's say in the race run training 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.500
 internal then treadmill swimming e 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 bicycle 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.530
 there is also a version that only 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 for the ride while I do this here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 to see shortly is precisely and multi sport 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 from all these specialties before 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.700
 show them in detail how it works 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:53.309
 let's make a move besides the clock 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:57.120
 we have this which is a shopping bag of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.640
 plastic to connect it to the handlebar 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:09.840
 of the bicycle a manual of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:12.390
 instructions this that support for 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.770
 part of the watch then I'll show 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.960
 and that fits here just ground then 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 connect it together with this clamp to the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.520
 bicycle support in this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.229
 that's what the charger is 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 strap is semi-rigid plastic 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.540
 I will show you this closure 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.540
 with this double dentinho it is enough 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 comfortable to wear and the grip is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 decidedly strong on the wrist we have the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.579
 our screen plus this other part that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.799
 a directional pad with the up buttons 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.350
 each side that allows you to navigate in 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.170
 menu as I will show you soon the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.180
 dial along with the button 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.390
 command detaches from the strap 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.790
 simply pushing you see in this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.259
 so the strap can also be used 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.300
 replace and then of course this 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.319
 you can use it with for example 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.859
 accessories that in fact 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.909
 a little while ago for the operation with the 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:21.560
 bicycle to recharge it must be inserted 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.560
 in this way 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.680
 after which there is a door on the other side 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 usb that you can also connect to a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.849
 a computer to recharge the battery 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.120
 this is the main quadrant 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.189
 screen is a blank lcd model e 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.909
 black that can be illuminated by passing 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:44.189
 the finger on these three dots that there 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.379
 I'm here on the lighting side is 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.909
 simply the clear indignation that 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.719
 then a little bit on bloom 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.730
 as I said in this area I am 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.019
 used of four commands which 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.060
 allow you to navigate within the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.590
 menu 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.400
 this is the main screen with time 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.139
 it's given 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.169
 if we go to the left we see the data 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:10.439
 on the multi sport then the state 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.480
 of the battery the memory the state 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.759
 of the gps then in the firmware version 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.549
 all the navigation is done by going to 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.060
 left right up toward up e 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.970
 bass 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.930
 clicking down from the screen 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.970
 does so and then let's go see those 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.609
 which are the basic settings of the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.540
 phone then from the watch itself to 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:37.979
 change their or date to the state 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.590
 of the sensors to some options that 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.549
 allow you to enable or not 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.439
 vibration change unit of measurement to 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.599
 personal profile that must be 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.139
 entered so that the data then 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.719
 especially those for example of the 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.969
 cardio status of calorie consumption 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.819
 are calculated correctly 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.489
 to exit just go back up 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.780
 all right screens left 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.750
 high and low so we go to the right 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.109
 and we can already choose one here 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.939
 of the four ways it works 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.639
 this multisport and I remember there is also the 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.650
 version only traveled then race 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.910
 bicycle are two activities from 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.760
 consider doing 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.420
 outdoors while swimming in the pool or at the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.800
 sea ​​and then carpet then the run in 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.170
 closed environment 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.760
 I gave you this difference because if 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.320
 for example we mention rug e 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.680
 we go to the right 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.420
 see we can immediately start 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.760
 training if we choose the 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.790
 what like outdoors doesn't start because yes 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.080
 is waiting to connect in a manner 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.480
 current you have something down 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.060
 in the left corner flashing the 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.770
 satellite symbol I was saying is 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.210
 waiting to connect in a manner 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.440
 correct to the satellites to maintain 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.250
 withdraw correctly 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.600
 the speed the shift and therefore can 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.980
 cross all the data to give you some 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.710
 correct information on yours 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.960
 physical activity 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.100
 once we choose the mode in 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.170
 this moment to do faster 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.290
 I accept internal ones that you don't need 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.800
 the pil of gps satellites just click 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.520
 on the right and you can start doing 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.530
 this workout 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.680
 if we want other other functions instead 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.960
 I'm sorry to be back now 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.660
 back here are other related options 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 training itself and we still want it 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.560
 carpet before leaving I can go 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.690
 upwards in this case the whole 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.180
 chronology of the previous elements or 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.020
 down to decide for example 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.540
 to set goals for 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.380
 start a mileage race you want 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.710
 you can choose various specialties for 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.830
 decide whether to make laps dance on 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.430
 time on the distance and view 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.560
 obviously where it must be 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.830
 displayed inside the screen i 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.210
 various calories distance gait parameters 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.610
 duration and so on 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.560
 if you are sporting and passionate 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.620
 this is a companion to ideal commercials 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.090
 certainly in this case 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.860
 you should be both passionate about 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.110
 running than swimming for the chip read 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.210
 or at least a couple of these sports 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.439
 because if you want only 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.750
 run then you can save 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:40.680
 a few euros taking the version 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:43.479
 solely for for travel cyclical 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.120
 the savings are not very high for this 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.009
 it costs 199 euros while that for the 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.719
 run then you can go and see if with 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.500
 tones various models only costs a few 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:54.430
 ten hours less 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.150
 eye though that if you think maybe in a 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.669
 future of doing even swimming and you want 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.770
 use it and udc maybe you should 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.490
 buy this obviously right away 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.500
 considering the disciplines also the way is 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.870
 completely waterproof and quite 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.599
 resistant so there are not 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.930
 problems of this case is simple to 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:19.599
 use after playing a little with i 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.789
 so lower joystick with the pad 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:24.039
 directional you will see that really there 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.129
 keep very little to learn a 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:28.870
 issue the command directly 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.740
 I would say that for this from multi sports and 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.870
 all and thank you for following me 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:38.319
 obviously commented below and 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:40.120
 ask I will answer you and then it's on 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.599
 see you on the page 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.599
 they can away
