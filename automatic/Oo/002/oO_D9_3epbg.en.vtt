00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
money one thing I've been doing is I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
money one thing I've been doing is I
found<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.220> paintings<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.939> where

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
found out where the paintings are where

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
found out where the paintings are where
they<00:01:06.420> usually<00:01:06.659> spawn<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> every<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
they usually spawn and every now and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.039 
they usually spawn and every now and
then<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> will<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:09.780> like

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
then you will get one on the side like

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
then you will get one on the side like
as<00:01:10.170> soon<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> building<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
as soon as you get to the building but

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
as soon as you get to the building but
usually<00:01:12.330> they're<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.840> rooms<00:01:13.140> during<00:01:13.560> one

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
usually they're in two rooms during one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.710 
usually they're in two rooms during one
that's<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> basic<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that's in the basic right right by the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's in the basic right right by the
front<00:01:16.020> window<00:01:16.850> like<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> front

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
front window like right by the front

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.999 
front window like right by the front
entrance<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:19.979> that's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
entrance and then you have one that's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
entrance and then you have one that's
right<00:01:20.369> above<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> front<00:01:20.939> entrance<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.509> those

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
right above the front entrance and those

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
right above the front entrance and those
are<00:01:22.020> usually<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> most<00:01:22.470> heavily<00:01:23.310> guarded

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
are usually the most heavily guarded

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
are usually the most heavily guarded
areas<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.990> usually<00:01:25.290> where<00:01:25.500> you're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
areas so that's usually where you're

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100 
areas so that's usually where you're
going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> find<00:01:26.100> those<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
going to find those but again you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
going to find those but again you can
get<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.500> lucky<00:01:28.710> depending<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
get really lucky depending on where it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.539 
get really lucky depending on where it
spawns<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.869> random<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.560> keep<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
spawns because it is random and keep in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
spawns because it is random and keep in
mind<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.090> usually<00:01:33.720> use<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> same<00:01:34.409> route

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
mind that I usually use the same route

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
mind that I usually use the same route
but<00:01:34.920> depends<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.030> how<00:01:36.600> many<00:01:36.659> windows<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.110> open

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
but depends on how many windows are open

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
but depends on how many windows are open
because<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.829> windows<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.400> change<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> get

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because the windows do change so you get

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
because the windows do change so you get
a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.110> bit<00:01:40.200> different<00:01:40.560> variety<00:01:41.180> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a little bit different variety it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.520 
a little bit different variety it
definitely<00:01:42.570> helps<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.049> stealthy

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
definitely helps if you're stealthy

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
definitely helps if you're stealthy
because<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.979> you're<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.159> stealthy<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> will

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because if you're not stealthy you will

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.660 
because if you're not stealthy you will
get<00:01:45.329> swarmed<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.200> plenty<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> people<00:01:47.159> because

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
get swarmed by plenty of people because

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.420 
get swarmed by plenty of people because
this<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> five<00:01:48.960> star<00:01:48.990> heist<00:01:49.649> basically<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
this is a five star heist basically is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190 
this is a five star heist basically is
what<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.670> call<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.049> with

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
what they call it you can do this with

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
what they call it you can do this with
one<00:01:52.380> person<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.549> person<00:01:53.880> all

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
one person I do this with one person all

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
one person I do this with one person all
the<00:01:54.030> time<00:01:54.149> especially<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.229> boosting<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the time especially if I'm boosting it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
the time especially if I'm boosting it's
a<00:01:56.369> lot<00:01:56.460> easier<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> easier<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:57.930> full
