00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.780 

hey<00:00:00.900> guys<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.560> CG<00:00:01.860> animator<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.520> today

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey guys this is CG animator and today

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.579 
hey guys this is CG animator and today
I'm<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> explain<00:00:03.510> symmetry<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.529> you

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I'm going to explain symmetry to you

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.490 
I'm going to explain symmetry to you
guys<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:05.160> it's<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.670> really<00:00:05.850> really<00:00:06.500> big

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
guys so it's a really really big

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.280 
guys so it's a really really big
lifesaver<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.250> ZBrush<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.960> it<00:00:09.960> would<00:00:10.110> make

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
lifesaver in ZBrush and it would make

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.850 
lifesaver in ZBrush and it would make
things<00:00:10.969> twice<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.150> hard<00:00:12.410> if<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.590> didn't<00:00:13.769> have

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
things twice as hard if we didn't have

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
things twice as hard if we didn't have
it<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.040> let's<00:00:14.340> go<00:00:14.460> ahead<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.599> jump<00:00:15.870> right

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it so let's go ahead and just jump right

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.269 
it so let's go ahead and just jump right
into<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.379> first<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> do

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
into it so first thing I'm going to do

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.320 
into it so first thing I'm going to do
is<00:00:17.490> go<00:00:17.699> into<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:17.910> tool<00:00:18.240> palette<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:19.160> 303<00:00:20.160> D

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
is go into my tool palette here 303 D

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.700 
is go into my tool palette here 303 D
let's<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.510> ahead<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.869> drag<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.500> if

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
let's go ahead and just drag that out if

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.810 
let's go ahead and just drag that out if
you<00:00:22.920> don't<00:00:23.100> know<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.460> any<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you don't know how to do any of this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
you don't know how to do any of this
I've<00:00:24.060> explained<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.510> all<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.289> basic

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I've explained it all in my basic

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429 
I've explained it all in my basic
navigation<00:00:26.090> tutorials<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> ZBrush<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
navigation tutorials and ZBrush so just

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.419 
navigation tutorials and ZBrush so just
go<00:00:28.529> ahead<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> check<00:00:28.890> those<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.400> you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
go ahead and check those out if you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.800 
go ahead and check those out if you
haven't<00:00:29.609> seen<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.750> how

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
haven't seen them and you don't know how

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
haven't seen them and you don't know how
to<00:00:30.869> work<00:00:31.019> ZBrush<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.489> our

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to work ZBrush so here we have our

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
to work ZBrush so here we have our
sphere<00:00:32.910> 3d<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.690> let's<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.320> ahead<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.530> make

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
sphere 3d now let's go ahead and make

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.240 
sphere 3d now let's go ahead and make
polymesh3d<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> edit<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:37.250> okay

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
polymesh3d so that we can edit it okay

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330 
polymesh3d so that we can edit it okay
so<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:39.350> let's<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.500> ahead<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.800> turn<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so now let's go ahead and turn on

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
so now let's go ahead and turn on
symmetry<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.660> there's<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:42.960> ways<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
symmetry so there's two ways to do this

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
symmetry so there's two ways to do this
you're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> transform<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> select

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you're going to transform and you select

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
you're going to transform and you select
activate<00:00:45.989> symmetry<00:00:46.730> or<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.300> press<00:00:48.450> X<00:00:49.340> that's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
activate symmetry or you press X that's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.600 
activate symmetry or you press X that's
the<00:00:50.579> keyboard<00:00:51.059> shortcut<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> front

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the keyboard shortcut now this is front

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
the keyboard shortcut now this is front
of<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.199> they

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of you here and you can see now they

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.680 
of you here and you can see now they
have<00:00:55.440> symmetry<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.610> x<00:00:56.969> axis<00:00:57.120> x<00:00:57.570> axis

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
have symmetry on the x axis x axis

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.619 
have symmetry on the x axis x axis
symmetry<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.399> dots<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> side

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
symmetry I have two dots one on one side

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.280 
symmetry I have two dots one on one side
one<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> other<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.410> means<00:01:03.290> while

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
one on the other and that means while

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.990 
one on the other and that means while
the<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.619> dot<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.250> manipulative

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the other dot is the other manipulative

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
the other dot is the other manipulative
point<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.630> whatever<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.040> side<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
point so whatever you do on one side it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
point so whatever you do on one side it
will<00:01:08.580> manipulate<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.409> know

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
will manipulate on the other now to know

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
will manipulate on the other now to know
which<00:01:10.740> side<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.100> yours<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:11.970> with

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
which side is yours is just the one with

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
which side is yours is just the one with
the<00:01:12.180> two<00:01:12.299> rings<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.500> I'll<00:01:13.619> explain<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.130> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the two rings and I'll explain what that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.630 
the two rings and I'll explain what that
entering<00:01:14.729> does<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> separate<00:01:15.840> tutorial<00:01:16.640> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
entering does in a separate tutorial but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
entering does in a separate tutorial but
um<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.950> 2x

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
um that's all there is really to it 2x

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.109 
um that's all there is really to it 2x
symmetry<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:22.369> all<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
symmetry here all there is to it just

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
symmetry here all there is to it just
like<00:01:24.299> blender<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.020> does<00:01:25.229> half<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> work

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
like blender it just does half the work

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.899 
like blender it just does half the work
for<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:29.070> did<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> stuff

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
for you now I just did a lot of stuff

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
for you now I just did a lot of stuff
there<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> control<00:01:30.840> Z<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there so I have to control Z it and so I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
there so I have to control Z it and so I
don't<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> store

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
don't have to do that I'm going to store

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.899 
don't have to do that I'm going to store
morph<00:01:33.119> target<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> does<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.790> go

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
morph target and all that does will go

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390 
morph target and all that does will go
back<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.210> front<00:01:36.390> view<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.100> store<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
back into front view is if I store a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.090 
back into front view is if I store a
morph<00:01:38.610> target<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:40.350> after<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.740> mess<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
morph target and then after they mess it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.950 
morph target and then after they mess it
up<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.540> press<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
up I press which it will go back to this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.120 
up I press which it will go back to this
target<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> store<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:48.090> um<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> little

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
target I store but um there's a little

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460 
target I store but um there's a little
bit<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.540> aware<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
bit of a thing if be aware about is that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.319 
bit of a thing if be aware about is that
if<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> keep<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.820> switch<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
if you keep going and then you switch it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030 
if you keep going and then you switch it
again<00:01:54.659> without<00:01:54.990> deleting<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> will<00:01:55.950> go

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
again without deleting it it will go

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
again without deleting it it will go
back<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.399> first<00:01:56.969> thing<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
back to that first thing that you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
back to that first thing that you
switched<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.009> place<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.090> just

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
switched in the first place so it just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.990 
switched in the first place so it just
controls<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
controls you this and so when you have

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
controls you this and so when you have
the<00:02:03.270> mesh<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.899> want<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.860> delete<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the mesh you want just delete it the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.449 
the mesh you want just delete it the
morph<00:02:06.299> target<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:06.899> store<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.170> again<00:02:07.459> but

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
morph target and then store it again but

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.979 
morph target and then store it again but
um<00:02:08.610> I'm<00:02:08.849> actually<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> delete<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
um I'm actually going to delete it so I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.260 
um I'm actually going to delete it so I
can<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.319> up

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
can go up

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.170 
can go up

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.640 
target so that's it for X symmetry C I'm
controlling<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.080> I'm<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.560> do

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
controlling but I'm just going to do

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.430 
controlling but I'm just going to do
that<00:02:24.770> if<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.010> do<00:02:25.070> too<00:02:25.310> much<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:27.260> thing<00:02:27.380> to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that if I do too much now one thing to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.560 
that if I do too much now one thing to
know<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.830> press<00:02:28.040> X<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:29.090> activate<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
know if you press X to activate the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.670 
know if you press X to activate the
symmetry<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.200> won't<00:02:30.350> activate<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.520> for<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.820> X

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
symmetry it won't activate it for the X

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.560 
symmetry it won't activate it for the X
symmetry<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.070> like<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.490> press<00:02:34.670> Y<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.330> won't

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
symmetry so like if you press Y it won't

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.120 
symmetry so like if you press Y it won't
activate<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.020> for<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> Y<00:02:36.290> symmetry<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.980> only

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
activate it for the Y symmetry it only

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.160 
activate it for the Y symmetry it only
actually<00:02:37.310> activates<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> symmetry<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.780> have

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
actually activates the symmetry you have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.620 
actually activates the symmetry you have
to<00:02:39.290> manually<00:02:39.620> choose<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> axis<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:41.800> x<00:02:42.800> axis<00:02:43.630> it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
to manually choose the axis so x axis it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.590 
to manually choose the axis so x axis it
does<00:02:44.990> symmetry<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> left<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.100> side

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
does symmetry on the left and right side

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.260 
does symmetry on the left and right side
y<00:02:47.600> axis<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.140> front<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.890> back<00:02:49.370> side<00:02:49.640> as<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.150> can

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
y axis is front and back side as you can

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.370 
y axis is front and back side as you can
see<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.540> some<00:02:53.870> random<00:02:54.020> stuff

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
see here so just do some random stuff

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.230 
see here so just do some random stuff
here<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:56.330> see<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.750> both<00:02:56.930> sides<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.470> so

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
here it see it's on both sides here so

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.790 
here it see it's on both sides here so
switch<00:02:59.240> delete<00:02:59.630> store<00:03:00.250> that's<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.460> for<00:03:01.610> y<00:03:02.800> z

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
switch delete store that's it for y z

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.390 
switch delete store that's it for y z
axis<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> top<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.150> bottom<00:03:05.590> really<00:03:06.590> simple<00:03:06.950> if

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
axis is top to bottom really simple if

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
axis is top to bottom really simple if
you<00:03:07.550> know<00:03:08.000> anything<00:03:08.510> about<00:03:08.720> animation<00:03:09.500> or

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you know anything about animation or

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.510 
you know anything about animation or
algebra<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:11.090> shouldn't<00:03:11.390> be<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> real<00:03:11.780> problem

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
algebra it shouldn't be a real problem

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:20.580 
algebra it shouldn't be a real problem
but<00:03:13.960> okay<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.530> we<00:03:18.800> have<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.100> we<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.120> go<00:03:20.150> into

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
but okay so we have that we can go into

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.590 
but okay so we have that we can go into
radio<00:03:21.670> symmetry<00:03:22.700> now<00:03:22.910> what<00:03:23.060> radial<00:03:23.420> symmetry

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
radio symmetry now what radial symmetry

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.870 
radio symmetry now what radial symmetry
does<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.440> does<00:03:24.620> matter<00:03:24.830> on<00:03:25.100> what<00:03:25.250> axis<00:03:25.700> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
does and it does matter on what axis you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.330 
does and it does matter on what axis you
have<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.360> be<00:03:26.720> aware<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.340> radial

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
have just be aware of that radial

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.530 
have just be aware of that radial
symmetry<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:28.820> way<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:28.970> turn<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.270> on<00:03:29.330> you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
symmetry the way to turn that on you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.290 
symmetry the way to turn that on you
just<00:03:29.660> press<00:03:29.810> R<00:03:30.110> right<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.850> transform

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
just press R right here in the transform

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.770 
just press R right here in the transform
palette<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.800> puts<00:03:34.430> more<00:03:35.090> than<00:03:35.480> one

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
palette and it just puts more than one

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.860 
palette and it just puts more than one
symmetry<00:03:36.260> point<00:03:36.709> on<00:03:36.980> your<00:03:37.610> mesh<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.390> if<00:03:38.600> I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
symmetry point on your mesh so like if I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.290 
symmetry point on your mesh so like if I
were<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.770> draw<00:03:40.100> something<00:03:40.370> out<00:03:40.580> here<00:03:40.910> there

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
were to draw something out here there

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.130 
were to draw something out here there
are<00:03:41.420> eight<00:03:41.570> points<00:03:41.930> going<00:03:42.200> along<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:42.950> see

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
are eight points going along with it see

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.290 
are eight points going along with it see
so<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.430> make<00:03:46.550> interesting<00:03:46.880> stuff<00:03:47.270> with

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
so you can make interesting stuff with

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.240 
so you can make interesting stuff with
that<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:47.900> let's<00:03:48.530> say<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.709> want<00:03:48.860> more<00:03:49.100> than

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
that but let's say you want more than

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.100 
that but let's say you want more than
eight<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.370> go<00:03:52.459> over<00:03:52.580> here<00:03:52.990> drop<00:03:53.990> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
eight you can just go over here drop the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.260 
eight you can just go over here drop the
radial<00:03:54.380> account<00:03:54.700> I'm<00:03:55.700> going<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:56.030> turn<00:03:56.120> up

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
radial account I'm going to turn up

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.340 
radial account I'm going to turn up
pretty<00:03:56.750> high<00:03:57.790> turn<00:03:58.790> down<00:03:58.940> my<00:03:59.030> draw<00:03:59.240> size<00:04:00.820> and

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
pretty high turn down my draw size and

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.210 
pretty high turn down my draw size and
cool<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:04.459> make<00:04:04.610> cool<00:04:05.830> illustrations<00:04:06.830> with

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
cool you make cool illustrations with

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.890 
cool you make cool illustrations with
this<00:04:08.320> see<00:04:09.459> make<00:04:10.459> them<00:04:10.730> interesting<00:04:11.570> things

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
this see make them interesting things

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.880 
this see make them interesting things
with<00:04:12.290> that

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.129 

okay<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.549> then<00:04:16.699> I'll<00:04:16.910> show<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.660> guys<00:04:17.840> there's

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
okay and then I'll show you guys there's

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.710 
okay and then I'll show you guys there's
why<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.250> when<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:19.669> trip<00:04:19.910> chain<00:04:20.180> stuff<00:04:20.449> make

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
why and when you trip chain stuff make

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.590 
why and when you trip chain stuff make
sure<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.959> um<00:04:21.729> deselect<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.090> one<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.419> had

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
sure you um deselect the one you had

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.830 
sure you um deselect the one you had
previously<00:04:24.020> otherwise<00:04:24.789> yeah<00:04:25.789> you<00:04:26.479> have<00:04:26.630> just

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
previously otherwise yeah you have just

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
previously otherwise yeah you have just
a<00:04:26.930> bunch<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.199> stuff<00:04:27.380> going<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.800> here<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.220> that

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
a bunch of stuff going on here and that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.610 
a bunch of stuff going on here and that
looks<00:04:28.460> very<00:04:28.610> insane<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:30.229> doesn't<00:04:30.470> look<00:04:30.560> very

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
looks very insane it doesn't look very

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.499 
looks very insane it doesn't look very
neat<00:04:31.539> okay<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:32.600> now<00:04:32.870> here's<00:04:33.139> why<00:04:33.289> symmetry<00:04:34.509> C

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
neat okay so now here's why symmetry C

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.050 
neat okay so now here's why symmetry C
goes<00:04:35.780> from<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.190> X<00:04:37.610> symmetry

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
goes from like this and X symmetry

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.740 
goes from like this and X symmetry
obviously<00:04:38.660> well<00:04:39.620> oopsy<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:40.699> did<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:41.600> same

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
obviously well oopsy I did the same

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.719 
obviously well oopsy I did the same
thing<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:42.320> forgot<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.130> turn<00:04:43.340> off<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.580> other

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
thing I forgot to turn off the other

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.189 
thing I forgot to turn off the other
symmetry<00:04:44.479> so<00:04:46.090> there<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:48.340> um<00:04:49.840> yeah<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.020> that's

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
symmetry so there and um yeah so that's

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.689 
symmetry so there and um yeah so that's
all<00:04:51.380> you<00:04:51.530> there's<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.759> it

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
all you there's to it

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.490 
all you there's to it
yeah<00:04:55.699> so<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.630> turn<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:56.900> back<00:04:57.080> up<00:04:57.259> if<00:04:57.410> I

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
yeah so I can turn this back up if I

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.480 
yeah so I can turn this back up if I
want<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.099> just<00:05:00.520> make<00:05:01.520> some<00:05:01.699> cool<00:05:03.490> cool

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
want to it just make some cool cool

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.300 
want to it just make some cool cool
shapes<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:05.120> stuff<00:05:07.120> my<00:05:08.120> favorite<00:05:08.419> is<00:05:08.539> Z<00:05:09.310> radial

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
shapes and stuff my favorite is Z radial

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.480 
shapes and stuff my favorite is Z radial
symmetry<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.970> um<00:05:11.570> yeah<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.590> see<00:05:12.889> like<00:05:13.250> right

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
symmetry and um yeah I see like right

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.100 
symmetry and um yeah I see like right
now<00:05:13.669> would<00:05:13.820> be<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.970> it'd<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.570> real<00:05:14.750> pain<00:05:14.930> that

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
now would be a it'd be real pain that

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.360 
now would be a it'd be real pain that
just<00:05:15.139> controls<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.800> all<00:05:15.919> this<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:16.220> I'm<00:05:16.310> just

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
just controls the all this so I'm just

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.279 
just controls the all this so I'm just
going<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.639> switch<00:05:16.880> my<00:05:16.910> morph<00:05:17.270> target<00:05:17.660> strong

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
going to switch my morph target strong

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.370 
going to switch my morph target strong
delete<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.650> okay<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:19.639> now<00:05:19.909> I'm<00:05:20.150> turn<00:05:20.990> radial

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
delete it okay so now I'm turn radial

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.560 
delete it okay so now I'm turn radial
off<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.830> just<00:05:22.010> go<00:05:22.310> back<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.580> X<00:05:22.760> symmetry<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:23.510> we

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
off and just go back to X symmetry so we

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.430 
off and just go back to X symmetry so we
have<00:05:23.659> normal<00:05:24.099> so<00:05:25.099> turn<00:05:25.669> my<00:05:25.789> draw<00:05:25.940> size<00:05:26.150> up<00:05:26.440> so

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
have normal so turn my draw size up so

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.020 
have normal so turn my draw size up so
let's<00:05:27.650> say<00:05:27.830> you're<00:05:28.159> messing<00:05:28.550> with<00:05:28.580> something

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
let's say you're messing with something

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.460 
let's say you're messing with something
you've<00:05:29.210> been<00:05:29.270> working<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.750> for<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:30.020> while<00:05:30.050> and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
you've been working on for a while and

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.730 
you've been working on for a while and
then<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.830> all<00:05:31.130> of<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.520> sudden<00:05:31.789> forget<00:05:32.120> or<00:05:32.990> you

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
then you all of a sudden forget or you

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.170 
then you all of a sudden forget or you
have<00:05:33.889> a<00:05:33.949> sudden<00:05:34.159> press<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.400> X<00:05:34.580> button<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.000> you

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
have a sudden press the X button and you

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.450 
have a sudden press the X button and you
turn<00:05:35.389> off<00:05:35.599> symmetry<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.590> you're<00:05:36.860> working<00:05:37.099> and

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
turn off symmetry and you're working and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.589 
turn off symmetry and you're working and
you're<00:05:37.580> working<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.120> you're<00:05:38.210> selling<00:05:38.479> in<00:05:38.539> the

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
you're working and you're selling in the

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.300 
you're working and you're selling in the
moment<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.169> don't<00:05:39.349> realize<00:05:39.470> that<00:05:39.889> just

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
moment that you don't realize that just

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.350 
moment that you don't realize that just
made<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.550> half<00:05:40.849> a<00:05:40.970> face<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:42.860> forgot<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:43.360> do

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
made a half a face and you forgot to do

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.120 
made a half a face and you forgot to do
symmetry<00:05:44.840> and<00:05:45.139> you're<00:05:45.349> thinking<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.860> have<00:05:46.039> to

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
symmetry and you're thinking I have to

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.399 
symmetry and you're thinking I have to
do<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.490> whole<00:05:46.610> thing<00:05:46.639> again<00:05:46.840> but<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.289> great

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
do the whole thing again but the great

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.010 
do the whole thing again but the great
thing<00:05:48.560> about<00:05:48.620> ZBrush<00:05:49.099> is<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.430> don't<00:05:49.610> have<00:05:49.760> to

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
thing about ZBrush is you don't have to

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.290 
thing about ZBrush is you don't have to
so<00:05:51.020> if<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:51.860> guys<00:05:52.070> are<00:05:52.130> not<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.430> mask<00:05:52.760> and<00:05:53.150> show

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
so if you guys are not a mask and show

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.330 
so if you guys are not a mask and show
you<00:05:53.360> guys<00:05:53.510> just<00:05:54.229> hold<00:05:54.320> ctrl<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.190> can

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
you guys just hold ctrl and you can

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.800 
you guys just hold ctrl and you can
either<00:05:55.430> paint<00:05:55.699> the<00:05:55.880> mask<00:05:56.060> what<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.419> mask<00:05:56.599> does

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
either paint the mask what the mask does

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.010 
either paint the mask what the mask does
is<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.260> you<00:05:57.409> can't<00:05:57.680> edit<00:05:58.280> that<00:05:58.760> point<00:05:59.060> that's

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
is that you can't edit that point that's

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.490 
is that you can't edit that point that's
masked<00:06:00.470> it's<00:06:01.130> not<00:06:01.490> it's<00:06:01.789> not<00:06:01.970> edible<00:06:02.500> editable

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
masked it's not it's not edible editable

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.300 
masked it's not it's not edible editable
so<00:06:04.280> sounded<00:06:04.970> like<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.210> said<00:06:05.389> edible<00:06:05.960> but<00:06:06.919> that's

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
so sounded like I said edible but that's

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.129 
so sounded like I said edible but that's
how<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.490> paint<00:06:07.909> a<00:06:08.030> mask<00:06:08.240> on<00:06:08.479> and<00:06:08.539> if<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.960> want

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
how you paint a mask on and if you want

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.210 
how you paint a mask on and if you want
to<00:06:09.970> layer<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.300> like<00:06:11.840> like<00:06:12.199> this<00:06:12.380> here<00:06:12.710> you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
to layer it on like like this here you

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.909 
to layer it on like like this here you
just<00:06:13.340> hold<00:06:13.550> ctrl<00:06:13.909> and<00:06:14.180> click<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.770> drag

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
just hold ctrl and click and drag

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.149 
just hold ctrl and click and drag
outside<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:17.449> mesh<00:06:17.990> in<00:06:18.259> the<00:06:18.470> open<00:06:18.740> 3d<00:06:18.949> space

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
outside of the mesh in the open 3d space

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.589 
outside of the mesh in the open 3d space
but<00:06:19.669> be<00:06:19.789> careful<00:06:20.090> that<00:06:20.210> you<00:06:20.270> don't<00:06:20.419> have<00:06:20.479> an

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
but be careful that you don't have an

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.290 
but be careful that you don't have an
alpha<00:06:20.990> on<00:06:21.199> because<00:06:21.620> if<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:21.770> do<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.159> will<00:06:22.400> mask

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
alpha on because if you do it will mask

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.500 
alpha on because if you do it will mask
with<00:06:23.659> the<00:06:23.810> Alpha<00:06:24.169> so<00:06:24.500> just<00:06:25.090> make<00:06:26.090> sure<00:06:26.210> but<00:06:26.389> you

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
with the Alpha so just make sure but you

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.659 
with the Alpha so just make sure but you
might<00:06:26.659> want<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.870> mask<00:06:27.169> with<00:06:27.380> the

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
might want to mask with the

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.489 
might want to mask with the
so<00:06:27.879> I<00:06:28.030> don't<00:06:28.210> know<00:06:28.270> but<00:06:28.930> if<00:06:29.020> you<00:06:29.110> want<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.289> clear

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:29.499 
so I don't know but if you want to clear

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.230 
so I don't know but if you want to clear
it<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:29.740> just<00:06:29.919> control<00:06:30.219> and<00:06:30.460> Dragon<00:06:30.819> open

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
it you just control and Dragon open

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.429 
it you just control and Dragon open
space<00:06:31.419> but<00:06:31.599> what<00:06:31.749> you<00:06:31.840> want<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.080> do<00:06:32.199> here<00:06:32.409> now

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 
space but what you want to do here now

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.749 
space but what you want to do here now
is<00:06:32.889> you<00:06:33.699> want<00:06:33.819> to<00:06:33.909> go<00:06:33.969> ahead<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.650> drag<00:06:35.759> mask

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
is you want to go ahead and drag mask

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.390 
is you want to go ahead and drag mask
over<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.330> half<00:06:37.479> that<00:06:37.629> you<00:06:37.779> want<00:06:37.990> them<00:06:38.400> the

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
over the half that you want them the

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.100 
over the half that you want them the
symmetry<00:06:39.819> like<00:06:40.120> if<00:06:40.240> I<00:06:40.300> want<00:06:40.539> this<00:06:40.659> half<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:41.020> be

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
symmetry like if I want this half to be

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.290 
symmetry like if I want this half to be
plastered<00:06:41.499> over<00:06:41.620> here<00:06:41.979> you<00:06:42.669> have<00:06:42.849> to<00:06:42.939> mask

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
plastered over here you have to mask

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.659 
plastered over here you have to mask
this<00:06:43.900> half<00:06:44.229> and<00:06:44.529> then<00:06:45.249> we're<00:06:45.370> going<00:06:45.490> to<00:06:45.520> go

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
this half and then we're going to go

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.489 
this half and then we're going to go
over<00:06:45.999> to<00:06:46.270> oh<00:06:47.909> okay<00:06:48.909> sorry<00:06:49.479> my<00:06:49.719> tablet<00:06:50.139> started

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:50.499 
over to oh okay sorry my tablet started

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.279 
over to oh okay sorry my tablet started
acting<00:06:50.770> up<00:06:50.830> there<00:06:51.270> go<00:06:52.270> over<00:06:52.300> to<00:06:52.599> deformation

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
acting up there go over to deformation

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.409 
acting up there go over to deformation
and<00:06:53.650> then<00:06:53.979> you<00:06:54.069> want<00:06:54.219> press<00:06:54.460> smart<00:06:54.789> recent<00:06:55.210> and

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
and then you want press smart recent and

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.540 
and then you want press smart recent and
make<00:06:55.599> sure<00:06:55.749> this<00:06:55.870> little<00:06:56.169> X<00:06:56.319> here<00:06:56.439> is<00:06:56.949> hit<00:06:57.249> so

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
make sure this little X here is hit so

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.149 
make sure this little X here is hit so
you<00:06:57.580> can<00:06:57.759> do<00:06:57.849> y&amp;z<00:06:58.479> as<00:06:58.599> well<00:06:58.779> so<00:06:59.499> just<00:06:59.529> select

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:00.159 
you can do y&amp;z as well so just select

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:01.469 
you can do y&amp;z as well so just select
that<00:07:00.219> and<00:07:00.520> you<00:07:00.610> can<00:07:00.759> see<00:07:00.879> it's<00:07:00.969> analyzing<00:07:01.240> the

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
that and you can see it's analyzing the

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.510 
that and you can see it's analyzing the
mesh<00:07:01.689> and<00:07:01.960> because<00:07:02.860> we<00:07:03.009> didn't<00:07:03.250> do<00:07:03.340> too<00:07:03.490> much

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
mesh and because we didn't do too much

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.769 
mesh and because we didn't do too much
and<00:07:03.939> because<00:07:04.210> we<00:07:04.270> only<00:07:04.389> have<00:07:04.569> a<00:07:04.629> hundred

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
and because we only have a hundred

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.920 
and because we only have a hundred
thousand<00:07:05.229> Polly's<00:07:06.270> it<00:07:07.270> wasn't<00:07:07.750> that<00:07:07.810> big

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
thousand Polly's it wasn't that big

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.950 
thousand Polly's it wasn't that big
video<00:07:08.199> but<00:07:08.349> you<00:07:08.620> can<00:07:08.680> see<00:07:08.919> here<00:07:09.779> did<00:07:10.779> a<00:07:10.840> really

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
video but you can see here did a really

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.240 
video but you can see here did a really
good<00:07:11.110> job<00:07:11.169> everything's<00:07:11.680> perfectly<00:07:12.009> sim

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
good job everything's perfectly sim

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.709 
good job everything's perfectly sim
perfectly<00:07:13.590> aligned<00:07:14.590> with<00:07:14.740> itself<00:07:15.539> but<00:07:16.539> I'm

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
perfectly aligned with itself but I'm

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.129 
perfectly aligned with itself but I'm
just<00:07:17.020> be<00:07:17.139> aware<00:07:17.379> that<00:07:17.439> if<00:07:17.919> you're<00:07:18.610> up<00:07:18.819> to<00:07:18.969> like

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 
just be aware that if you're up to like

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.700 
just be aware that if you're up to like
twelve<00:07:20.139> thousand<00:07:20.560> Polly's<00:07:20.949> and<00:07:21.279> you<00:07:21.939> did<00:07:22.150> that

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
twelve thousand Polly's and you did that

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.469 
twelve thousand Polly's and you did that
then<00:07:23.710> it's<00:07:23.889> going<00:07:23.979> to<00:07:24.039> take<00:07:24.219> a<00:07:24.400> long<00:07:24.759> time<00:07:25.419> so

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
then it's going to take a long time so

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.329 
then it's going to take a long time so
just<00:07:25.990> be<00:07:26.139> aware<00:07:26.379> of<00:07:26.439> that<00:07:26.560> so<00:07:26.889> just<00:07:26.919> try<00:07:27.279> to

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:27.339 
just be aware of that so just try to

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:31.499 
just be aware of that so just try to
keep<00:07:27.550> your<00:07:27.610> X<00:07:28.210> symmetry<00:07:28.719> on<00:07:29.069> okay<00:07:30.069> so<00:07:30.509> that's

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:31.509 
keep your X symmetry on okay so that's

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:32.459 
keep your X symmetry on okay so that's
all<00:07:31.689> you<00:07:31.900> really<00:07:31.990> need<00:07:32.229> to<00:07:32.289> know<00:07:32.439> about

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:32.469 
all you really need to know about

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.939 
all you really need to know about
symmetry<00:07:32.949> to<00:07:33.279> get<00:07:33.430> started<00:07:33.909> right<00:07:33.939> now<00:07:34.240> so

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 
symmetry to get started right now so

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.829 
symmetry to get started right now so
should<00:07:35.949> watch<00:07:36.129> future<00:07:36.699> tutorials<00:07:37.300> on<00:07:37.479> ZBrush

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:37.839 
should watch future tutorials on ZBrush

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:40.230 
should watch future tutorials on ZBrush
and<00:07:38.139> I<00:07:38.439> will<00:07:38.620> be<00:07:38.740> keep<00:07:39.189> making<00:07:39.580> them<00:07:39.729> if<00:07:40.000> you

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
and I will be keep making them if you

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.909 
and I will be keep making them if you
keep<00:07:40.389> watching<00:07:40.509> them<00:07:40.779> okay<00:07:41.469> guys<00:07:41.620> thank<00:07:41.889> you

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 
keep watching them okay guys thank you
