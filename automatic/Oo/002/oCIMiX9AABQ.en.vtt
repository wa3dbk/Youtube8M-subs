forged<00:00:03.300> alliance<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.440> great<00:00:04.710> map<00:00:05.060> familiar

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
forged alliance is a great map familiar

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.890 
forged alliance is a great map familiar
to<00:00:06.180> some<00:00:06.299> people<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.649> just<00:00:07.919> tried<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.900> UI

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to some people and I just tried this UI

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.009 
to some people and I just tried this UI
mod<00:00:10.320> from<00:00:10.800> Azul<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.420> which<00:00:12.420> I've<00:00:12.570> seen<00:00:12.809> about

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
mod from Azul on which I've seen about

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.860 
mod from Azul on which I've seen about
tears<00:00:13.380> ago<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:13.920> never<00:00:14.130> installed<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.450> wish

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
tears ago but never installed and I wish

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
tears ago but never installed and I wish
I<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.170> done<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.650> years<00:00:16.770> ago<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:18.270> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I would have done it two years ago so it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529 
I would have done it two years ago so it
basically<00:00:18.779> allows<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> build<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.670> allows

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
basically allows you to build it allows

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
basically allows you to build it allows
you<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.750> map<00:00:21.990> keys<00:00:22.289> maybe<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.730> best<00:00:23.970> if<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you to map keys maybe it's the best if I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.890 
you to map keys maybe it's the best if I
go<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.740> key<00:00:25.740> mappings<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> press<00:00:26.519> f1<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
go to key mappings if you press f1 you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.880 
go to key mappings if you press f1 you
can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> menu<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.980> massive<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:29.760> there's

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
can see this menu is massive now there's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.049 
can see this menu is massive now there's
so<00:00:31.890> many<00:00:32.040> different<00:00:32.309> options<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.030> can

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so many different options that you can

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.569 
so many different options that you can
customize<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.920> i<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.219> put<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.460> link

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
customize this and i will put the link

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.650 
customize this and i will put the link
into<00:00:37.070> description<00:00:38.450> definitely<00:00:39.450> read

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
into description definitely read

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590 
into description definitely read
everything<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> says<00:00:40.850> before<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> install<00:00:42.300> on

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
everything it says before you install on

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.790 
everything it says before you install on
how<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> install<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.620> basically

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
how to install it but you can basically

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
how to install it but you can basically
assign<00:00:47.430> any<00:00:47.730> key<00:00:48.660> combination<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> building

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
assign any key combination to building

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.540 
assign any key combination to building
any<00:00:50.309> unit<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.530> organized<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.280> for

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
any unit and the way is organized it for

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.080 
any unit and the way is organized it for
example<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.030> AC<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> t3<00:00:54.960> ec<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.879> can<00:00:56.879> put

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
example with AC it's a t3 ec you can put

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.689 
example with AC it's a t3 ec you can put
a<00:00:57.120> push<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> button<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> few<00:00:58.170> times<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.460> AC

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a push a button a few times and this AC

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
a push a button a few times and this AC
you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.030> build<00:01:00.239> four<00:01:00.570> factories<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.440> example

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you can build four factories for example

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
you can build four factories for example
the<00:01:01.949> quantum<00:01:02.280> gate<00:01:03.170> probably<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.320> too

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the quantum gate probably a little too

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
the quantum gate probably a little too
expensive<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> I'll<00:01:06.180> build

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
expensive for me right now so I'll build

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
expensive for me right now so I'll build
something<00:01:06.479> else<00:01:07.010> what<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.130> did<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.369> push<00:01:08.939> w

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
something else what I did was push w

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.399 
something else what I did was push w
once<00:01:10.430> then<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.450> Intel<00:01:12.780> structures<00:01:13.229> for

which<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.500> build<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.860> ground<00:01:20.330> all<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
which we can build on ground all the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.780 
which we can build on ground all the
different<00:01:22.049> shields<00:01:22.409> plus<00:01:22.530> stealth<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
different shields plus stealth this is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.130 
different shields plus stealth this is
all<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.090> pushing<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.570> button<00:01:24.600> over<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
all just pushing one button over and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.620 
all just pushing one button over and
over<00:01:25.460> makes<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> extremely<00:01:26.820> simple<00:01:29.630> there's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
over makes it extremely simple there's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.490 
over makes it extremely simple there's
tactical<00:01:31.200> missile<00:01:31.530> defense<00:01:33.079> as<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.380> at

tactical missile defense as well as at

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530 
tactical missile defense as well as at
emd<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> couple<00:01:35.520> experimentals<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> can

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
emd here a couple experimentals you can

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.649 
emd here a couple experimentals you can
try<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> build<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.450> heat

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
try to build and this is a in the heat

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.300 
try to build and this is a in the heat
of<00:01:39.689> battle<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.320> instead<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> doing<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
of battle that instead of doing this and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
of battle that instead of doing this and
in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> past<00:01:44.640> players<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.270> used<00:01:45.509> build<00:01:45.810> mode

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
in the past players if used build mode

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
in the past players if used build mode
which<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.530> fine<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.729> used<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
which is fine which is what I'm used to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
which is fine which is what I'm used to
but<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.210> significantly<00:01:51.930> easier<00:01:52.170> since

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but this is significantly easier since

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.560 
but this is significantly easier since
it's<00:01:52.710> only<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.189> keystroke<00:01:53.549> instead<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.270> tooth

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
it's only one keystroke instead of tooth

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.550 
it's only one keystroke instead of tooth
so<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.110> does<00:01:56.290> help<00:01:56.530> out<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:59.320> three<00:01:59.590> different

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so it does help out here three different

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440 
so it does help out here three different
so<00:02:02.560> an<00:02:02.800> interesting<00:02:03.220> thing<00:02:03.370> happens<00:02:03.790> inside

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so an interesting thing happens inside

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.130 
so an interesting thing happens inside
the<00:02:04.510> factories<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.670> also<00:02:06.870> just<00:02:07.870> push<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
the factories you can also just push a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.560 
the factories you can also just push a
button<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.649> example<00:02:09.009> we<00:02:09.070> want<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.250> make<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.570> ng

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
button for example we want to make a ng

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.160 
button for example we want to make a ng

it<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.250> him<00:02:18.400> fit<00:02:18.580> building<00:02:18.940> another<00:02:19.180> ng<00:02:21.000> that

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it on him fit building another ng that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.720 
it on him fit building another ng that
is<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.330> cool<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:24.540> hit<00:02:25.540> alt

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
is really cool and then you can hit alt

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.250 
is really cool and then you can hit alt
and<00:02:27.730> then<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.090> an<00:02:28.180> ng<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.840> replace

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and then do an ng and you can replace

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
and then do an ng and you can replace
the<00:02:29.590> build<00:02:30.310> q<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:34.630> so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.089 

with<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.260> engineers<00:02:38.709> tech<00:02:39.129> one<00:02:39.310> engineer<00:02:41.099> can

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
with the engineers tech one engineer can

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.619 
with the engineers tech one engineer can
do<00:02:42.280> everything<00:02:42.579> that<00:02:42.849> they<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.390> can

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
accept that it can to build any higher

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.600 
accept that it can to build any higher
structures<00:02:46.439> and<00:02:47.439> you<00:02:47.560> take<00:02:47.799> tour<00:02:48.040> tech<00:02:48.280> 3<00:02:48.459> of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
structures and you take tour tech 3 of

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.880 
structures and you take tour tech 3 of
course<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.090> engineer<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.140> anything<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> ACU

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
course this engineer do anything the ACU

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.240 
course this engineer do anything the ACU
for<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.250> most<00:02:51.430> part<00:02:52.590> see<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.739> else<00:02:53.890> there

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
for the most part see what else there

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.149 
for the most part see what else there
that's<00:02:54.549> interesting<00:02:55.319> also<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.409> customs<00:02:56.860> all

here build on here here here that I

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:16.490 
here build on here here here that I
would<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:09.420> something<00:03:10.420> else<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> pigeon

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.899 

another<00:03:17.500> another<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.489> then<00:03:18.639> you<00:03:18.730> can

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
another another so then you can

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.520 
another another so then you can
appreciate<00:03:19.150> how<00:03:19.420> powerful<00:03:20.049> this<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.349> if

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
appreciate how powerful this is if

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.780 
appreciate how powerful this is if
you've<00:03:20.680> been<00:03:20.859> playing<00:03:21.069> this<00:03:21.220> for<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.459> while<00:03:21.579> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
you've been playing this for a while and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.649 
you've been playing this for a while and
haven't<00:03:22.000> been<00:03:22.120> using<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.540> mod<00:03:23.609> and

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
haven't been using this mod and

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.819 
haven't been using this mod and
hopefully<00:03:25.659> more<00:03:25.810> people<00:03:25.870> get<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.650> get

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
hopefully more people get it and get

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.580 
hopefully more people get it and get
used<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:28.780> twist<00:03:29.109> your<00:03:29.260> fingers

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
used to it and not twist your fingers

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.920 
used to it and not twist your fingers
after<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.920> while<00:03:30.099> putting<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.790> pinky<00:03:31.389> on<00:03:31.540> shift

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
after a while putting a pinky on shift

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.910 
after a while putting a pinky on shift
and<00:03:32.670> thumb<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.849> power<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.590> build<00:03:35.829> a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
and thumb and power just to build a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.300 
and thumb and power just to build a
power<00:03:36.159> generator<00:03:36.870> gets<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.989> little<00:03:38.079> old<00:03:38.319> and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
power generator gets a little old and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.780 
power generator gets a little old and
all<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.579> got<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.879> do<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.389> press<00:03:41.340> f<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.430> of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
all you got to do is just press f and of

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.339 
all you got to do is just press f and of
course<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.239> real<00:03:46.419> beauty<00:03:46.629> here<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.199> you

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
course the real beauty here is that you

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.020 
course the real beauty here is that you
can<00:03:47.500> assign<00:03:47.799> anything<00:03:48.129> to<00:03:48.489> anything<00:03:48.669> you<00:03:48.849> want

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
can assign anything to anything you want

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.839 
can assign anything to anything you want
and<00:03:49.269> one<00:03:49.840> warning<00:03:50.260> ah<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:51.190> probably<00:03:51.430> want<00:03:51.730> to

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
and one warning ah you probably want to

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.000 
and one warning ah you probably want to
assign<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.120> few<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:52.599> things<00:03:52.660> back<00:03:53.019> things

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
assign a few of your things back things

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.930 
assign a few of your things back things
like<00:03:54.190> very<00:03:54.840> launch<00:03:55.840> tactical<00:03:56.560> missiles<00:03:56.940> have

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
like very launch tactical missiles have

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.849 
like very launch tactical missiles have
to<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.269> reassigned<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:58.989> hopefully<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.680> is

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
to be reassigned so hopefully this is

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.339 
to be reassigned so hopefully this is
useful<00:04:00.660> hopefully<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.690> lot<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.079> more<00:04:02.199> people

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
useful hopefully a lot of more people

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.010 
useful hopefully a lot of more people
use<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.650> small
