00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
use the clutch and I'm now in a position

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.730 
use the clutch and I'm now in a position
to<00:00:22.830> tell<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.609> much<00:00:23.670> i<00:00:23.910> love<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.330> i<00:00:24.740> am

to tell you just how much i love it i am

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.790 
to tell you just how much i love it i am
a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:26.250> hard<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.609> back<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.230> monogram

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a little hard on back so the monogram

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
a little hard on back so the monogram
print<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.519> isn't<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> good<00:00:30.779> fit<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.260> me

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
print really isn't a good fit for me

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
print really isn't a good fit for me
because<00:00:32.040> it'll<00:00:32.309> look<00:00:32.430> bad<00:00:32.730> more<00:00:33.329> sooner

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because it'll look bad more sooner

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.740 
because it'll look bad more sooner
sooner<00:00:34.260> rather<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.710> later<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.100> i<00:00:35.670> tend<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> go

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sooner rather than later so i tend to go

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.500 
sooner rather than later so i tend to go
with<00:00:37.489> darker<00:00:39.559> darker<00:00:40.559> bags<00:00:41.270> because<00:00:42.270> they

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
with darker darker bags because they

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
with darker darker bags because they
suit<00:00:42.750> me<00:00:42.780> better<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.879> klutz<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.690> I
