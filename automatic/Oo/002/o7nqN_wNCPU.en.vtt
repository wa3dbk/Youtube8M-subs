what<00:06:37.620> happens<00:06:37.919> when<00:06:38.009> the<00:06:38.130> Golem<00:06:38.400> explodes<00:06:38.819> I

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
what happens when the Golem explodes I

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.550 
what happens when the Golem explodes I
think<00:06:39.389> that<00:06:39.539> he<00:06:39.630> might<00:06:39.810> take<00:06:40.050> out<00:06:40.199> the<00:06:40.349> mortar

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
think that he might take out the mortar

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.189 
think that he might take out the mortar
yes<00:06:40.979> he<00:06:41.190> does<00:06:41.400> so<00:06:41.669> the<00:06:41.819> gun<00:06:42.060> when<00:06:42.419> he<00:06:42.449> exploded

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
yes he does so the gun when he exploded

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.159 
yes he does so the gun when he exploded
took<00:06:43.770> out<00:06:43.949> the<00:06:44.130> mortar<00:06:44.509> which<00:06:45.509> was<00:06:45.720> awesome

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
took out the mortar which was awesome

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.200 
took out the mortar which was awesome

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
King is working his way around to

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.909 
King is working his way around to
pekka's<00:06:50.970> are<00:06:51.090> coming<00:06:51.360> in<00:06:51.449> behind<00:06:51.660> I<00:06:52.199> don't

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
pekka's are coming in behind I don't

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.650 
pekka's are coming in behind I don't
know<00:06:53.099> what<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.639> health<00:06:53.880> is<00:06:54.090> on<00:06:54.300> them<00:06:54.479> but<00:06:54.630> I

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
know what the health is on them but I

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.659 
know what the health is on them but I
know<00:06:54.750> one<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.110> them<00:06:55.259> is<00:06:55.380> pretty<00:06:55.860> low<00:06:56.250> than<00:06:56.580> the

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
know one of them is pretty low than the

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.600 
know one of them is pretty low than the
other<00:06:56.880> one<00:06:57.150> is<00:06:57.360> doing<00:06:57.979> ok<00:06:58.979> on<00:06:59.009> health<00:06:59.340> I<00:06:59.460> think

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
other one is doing ok on health I think

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.610 
other one is doing ok on health I think
is<00:06:59.699> it<00:06:59.849> like<00:06:59.970> 80%<00:07:00.330> or<00:07:00.690> something<00:07:00.960> some<00:07:01.139> two

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
is it like 80% or something some two

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.070 
is it like 80% or something some two
defenses<00:07:02.160> left<00:07:02.400> a<00:07:02.639> whole<00:07:03.240> bunch<00:07:03.449> of<00:07:03.570> walls<00:07:03.810> in

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
defenses left a whole bunch of walls in

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.499 
defenses left a whole bunch of walls in
the<00:07:04.169> way<00:07:04.289> and<00:07:04.639> King<00:07:05.639> goes<00:07:05.880> down<00:07:06.150> right<00:07:06.330> there

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
the way and King goes down right there

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.969 
the way and King goes down right there
so<00:07:06.660> you<00:07:06.750> can<00:07:06.900> see<00:07:07.020> how<00:07:07.139> low<00:07:07.380> that<00:07:07.590> pekka's

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
so you can see how low that pekka's

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.980 
so you can see how low that pekka's
health<00:07:08.190> is<00:07:08.400> but<00:07:08.699> she's<00:07:09.240> holding<00:07:09.419> up<00:07:09.630> strong

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
health is but she's holding up strong

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.749 
health is but she's holding up strong
not<00:07:10.500> to<00:07:10.650> break<00:07:10.860> through<00:07:11.070> this<00:07:11.280> is<00:07:11.490> probably

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
not to break through this is probably

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.400 
not to break through this is probably
yeah<00:07:12.090> one<00:07:12.300> two<00:07:12.509> it's<00:07:12.690> just<00:07:12.870> gonna<00:07:12.960> take<00:07:13.199> two

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
yeah one two it's just gonna take two

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.490 
yeah one two it's just gonna take two
shots<00:07:13.680> we<00:07:14.099> only<00:07:14.310> had<00:07:14.759> guys<00:07:15.030> legit<00:07:15.570> we<00:07:16.020> had<00:07:16.199> ten

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
shots we only had guys legit we had ten

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.790 
shots we only had guys legit we had ten
seconds<00:07:16.979> left<00:07:17.160> over<00:07:18.050> at<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.139> end<00:07:19.289> of<00:07:19.500> this<00:07:19.590> so

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
seconds left over at the end of this so

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.740 
seconds left over at the end of this so
one<00:07:19.979> of<00:07:20.009> the<00:07:20.130> pekus<00:07:20.430> goes<00:07:20.610> down<00:07:20.849> last<00:07:21.479> one

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
one of the pekus goes down last one

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.110 
one of the pekus goes down last one
comes<00:07:22.020> in<00:07:22.259> and<00:07:22.500> I<00:07:22.770> believe<00:07:22.800> that<00:07:23.430> the<00:07:23.639> oh<00:07:23.909> it

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
comes in and I believe that the oh it

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.520 
comes in and I believe that the oh it
looked<00:07:24.270> like<00:07:24.389> the<00:07:24.509> archer<00:07:24.870> didn't<00:07:25.080> look<00:07:25.169> look

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
looked like the archer didn't look look

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.300 
looked like the archer didn't look look

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
a layered the Pekka was frozen in time

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.610
