00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 to me 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello friends tell your friends bank 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.760
 list and greetings to all 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.190
 installers and make-up artists of the system 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.410
 I bring the one from Lima and all the Peru 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 well here, resuming after a lot 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 time with a new contribution on a subject 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.169
 which I think is very important whose title 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.239
 it's how cheap it's expensive it's more than 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.450
 clear that this phrase applies in many 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.090
 fields for example one buys a 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.149
 cheap used car and possibly this 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.309
 car bring start problems where 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.590
 you have to buy spare parts and leave more 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.340
 expensive than we initially thought 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.129
 but how would this phrase be applied to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 drywall system good I tell you that a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.679
 Once I went to visit one of the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.570
 health facilities and I stayed 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.120
 surprised about the installation of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.399
 some works done in dry word and not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 precisely for a good installation 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 but I was surprised by the fact that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.280
 as bad advice can lead to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.770
 terrible results that's why I took 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 some photos to be able to explain 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.329
 because these things happen 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 to mention that I'm not criticizing 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.909
 quite the opposite the sole purpose of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.549
 this is to improve the system and I know that still 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.009
 so I will receive bad comments but 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.860
 well worth it to improve the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.069
 system here we have a ceiling with 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.950
 202-foot acoustic tile with one 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.320
 15 16 inch suspension 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.659
 it is clear that both the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.619
 suspension as the tiles are 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.420
 deteriorated but in an abnormal way 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.390
 atypical few times I've seen something like that 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.759
 the tiles are pumped things that 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.399
 It is not very usual in this type of material 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.220
 the radio is always deteriorating but 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.890
 not in this way you really see a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.049
 bad image of the environment was passed the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.600
 answer is here this is the part 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.670
 outside of the environment in question the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.099
 acoustic ceiling and is installed 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 under a strong fiber cover 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.110
 it turns out that transfers the heat of the sun 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 stone by 'the and comes to the same 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.790
 tile as it is known in the tile is not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 a material that supports temperatures of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.959
 exterior are materials that are 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.480
 designed to work indoors 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.180
 because even if it is below the fiber 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.489
 strong is not enough the heat makes 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 that the tiles will not be 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.260
 combine in this way I have had 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.079
 times when I've been inside a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.370
 environment whose roof was only covered 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.409
 consider strong 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 and it's an oven when the sun is in its 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.659
 maximum splendor I'm not saying that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 the strong strip is human to the contrary 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.470
 It is a good choice in terms of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.349
 coverage is about but you have to know 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.049
 apply it if it's not like that the result is 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.000
 catastrophic one of the functions of 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.489
 this work would have been that instead of 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.069
 put tiles would have been installed 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.829
 a silo dragon time because the plaster is 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.379
 more resistant the drago for exterior 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.930
 obviously another option is that between 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.329
 tiles and strong fiber is installed 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.250
 a woolen blanket the glass or instead of 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.620
 the fiber carries plates of 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.019
 thermos ceilings that also nullify the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.599
 heat input and so several options 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.760
 the idea is that the heat reaches us 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.709
 tile there are many technicians in the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.900
 system I bring very good you can them 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.599
 give guidelines on this good work and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.970
 another little thing more in this project is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.519
 that also the misalignment reprimanded or 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.770
 false league I bring you what supports the 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.630
 Strong fiber up soon friends 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.630
 to me
