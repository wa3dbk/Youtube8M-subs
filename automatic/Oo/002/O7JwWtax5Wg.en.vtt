00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.669
 Greetings to all people 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.549
 women 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.759
 who think the same or similar to the ideas that I will expose next 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.539
 and my respects to the men who also share them 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.829
 I really hope everyone likes it 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.409
 kindly a woman 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:19.659
 the present day 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.689
 while I was doing the previous video 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 I found an article on the internet that has caught my attention 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.999
 sexist toys 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.539
 He said 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.910
 Since a good time we have all been hearing about sexism spread in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 toys 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.170
 but hey, you're impressed by the point where this problem has gone 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.260
 advancing because yes that is a problem 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.839
 the article commented on a small demonstration in paris 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.909
 where they entered a toy store 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.440
 a group of people trying to change the toys in the children's section 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.960
 to the children's 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 and calling some others violent 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.940
 up to this point I would have also wanted to be there pence 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.670
 although it is something a bit extreme 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.410
 but it was about time someone did something 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.289
 what surprised me most 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.049
 of the article was that apart from the fact that the store was 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.630
 traditional newborn dolls 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.870
 cooking games tea sets 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.600
 that by the way are very well is in accordance with our reality governs us 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.689
 or at least 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.109
 this is what is sought was also among these toys 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 Pilates dolls as mom 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 vacuum cleaners from three years to do cleaning like mom and dad 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.970
 as you dry with red lace underwear in your shopping bags 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370
 red 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.430
 go see what they buy their girls 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.450
 every day in the channels for girls we are flooded 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410
 for one after another propaganda of toys 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.810
 but what kinds of toys 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.360
 definitely 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.359
 they're very few 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.429
 those that encourage the development of our children 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.819
 On the contrary, there are many who endorse chan with stereotyped ideas of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.759
 what should 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.219
 be a man so she should be a woman 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.790
 sadly though the day to day many men and women 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.719
 try to look for gender equality 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.250
 what is this 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 if everything we manage to move forward is destroyed from one moment to the next 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.720
 using fragile minds 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.179
 of the kids 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.209
 the worst is that sometimes 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.240
 are the same parents that a orán what they really do when buying from their 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.670
 line that doll that was worth it so expensive that it comes with so many accessories 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.209
 clothing 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.960
 shoes 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.559
 and wolves 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.719
 pool to party with the other girlfriends dolls 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.690
 strangely just as tall blondes 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.549
 blue-eyed 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.790
 unconsciously we are sending the real message of false stereotype of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.239
 woman to our girls not to mention the newborn dolls games 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.169
 kitchen elm washing machines one be you 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.469
 perelló 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.909
 I would feel much calmer watching our girls playing with toys 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.009
 that really encourage their development as people and future women 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.510
 and perhaps 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.720
 more than two hours 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.460
 trying to find some girl's toy what a place like a doll 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.530
 engineer football player maybe architect maybe astronaut or why not a 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.189
 doll president 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.010
 I would definitely buy many of those maybe some against without not 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.599
 miniskirt I omitted min but no 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.570
 I only found very dry mostly going to hilary navas 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.139
 singers with phrases as I like to paint measure of stores 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.819
 this is not OK 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.959
 never was 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.789
 I do not agree with those people 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.240
 what do they say girls do not like other toys 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.090
 Quino are strollers and tea sets that's a big lie 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.099
 I would have wanted you to give me 100 a set of toy tools 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.710
 I would have been very happy 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.740
 how he loved to disarm and put things together a play with those carts that looked 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.439
 so amazing and dreamed with my racing tracks 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.369
 but I did not dare to ask for them because they advertise them as children's toys 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.259
 once I remember taking my brother's off-road remote control trolley 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.659
 but I was told that it was not for girls 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.250
 we do not grow 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.920
 that our girls grow up in that sexist environment in which we grew up 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.090
 many of us 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.870
 also there to stop conditioning the children 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.110
 do not deny that you should have told a child that you will not play 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.379
 with dolls 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.790
 because they were children 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.430
 let him play with pistols and soldiers 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.370
 because that's from men 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.980
 The truth is that there are no children's or girl's toys 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.809
 there are only toys and point 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:22.349
 The reality we see is that our society is in a process of change 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.430
 point the toys present society 20 years ago 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.110
 but not now 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.280
 It is not true that the woman is currently locked up at home 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.139
 that and have no other professional option 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.170
 It is not true that men do not change diapers or feed 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.539
 it is not true that the normal family has a father and mother 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.900
 but are worth media 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.949
 that's what we lie to children 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.990
 and that there of our girls 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.949
 who feel inferior to children in terms of sports skills 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.150
 ofisis boxes 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.419
 that when they try to play some sport of origin 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.189
 that you will not do the same or better than a million just for being a girl 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:10.809
 if a woman can not play well football to basketball other sport 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.089
 Maybe it's because the people because for her 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.760
 as well as for some of us 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.210
 it is not the cooked ironing 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.759
 not because of being a woman 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.849
 just as there are other women who perform very well in these sports 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.510
 we do not want to forget that while girls 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.400
 suffer the consequences of stereotypes that shorten and limit their 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.300
 potentialities 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.400
 children 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.790
 suffer the demands imposed by society on males has many 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.569
 occasions 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.619
 can be asphyxiating and cause complex 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.499
 in conclusion stop giving sexist toys 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.289
 at birthday parties stop buying 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.699
 or accept toys that mark in their sibling children what they should not today 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.220
 do talk with them spend time with them 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.850
 remember that far from what the media can say and 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.990
 everyone else for our little ones the most important opinion is that of their 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.680
 parents 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.569
 because they are his models 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.009
 more important
