you're<00:01:35.990> going<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.439> do<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.979> just<00:01:37.729> start<00:01:38.030> making

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
you're going to do is just start making

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.410 
you're going to do is just start making
little<00:01:38.750> stitch<00:01:39.020> lines<00:01:39.350> across<00:01:40.009> those<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.759> the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
little stitch lines across those and the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.690 
little stitch lines across those and the
key<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.200> just<00:01:42.409> keeping<00:01:42.829> minimum

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
key to this is just keeping minimum

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.749 
key to this is just keeping minimum
minimum<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.049> minimal<00:01:45.530> minimal<00:01:45.890> amount<00:01:46.520> of

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
minimum the minimal minimal amount of

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.059 
minimum the minimal minimal amount of
nail<00:01:47.270> polish<00:01:47.630> on<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.049> brush<00:01:48.079> if<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.740> makes

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
nail polish on the brush if that makes

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.130 
nail polish on the brush if that makes
sense<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.299> don't<00:01:50.569> get<00:01:50.750> too<00:01:50.869> much<00:01:50.989> on

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
sense but just don't get too much on

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.350 
sense but just don't get too much on
there<00:01:51.200> because<00:01:51.649> if<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:51.979> do<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.549> will<00:01:52.849> kind<00:01:53.299> of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
there because if you do it will kind of

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.050 
there because if you do it will kind of
come<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.689> really<00:01:53.869> thick<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.500> not<00:01:54.890> look<00:01:55.670> like

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
come out really thick and not look like

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.600 
come out really thick and not look like
stitches<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:56.810> anything<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.039> again

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
stitches or anything like that and again

to want to finish up with a topcoat
which<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.150> don't<00:02:20.240> have<00:02:20.569> pictured<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.230> because

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
which I don't have pictured here because

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.850 
which I don't have pictured here because
it's<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.860> me<00:02:22.040> putting<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.550> topcoat<00:02:22.819> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
it's just me putting on a topcoat and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.830 
it's just me putting on a topcoat and
that<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.430> sorry<00:02:25.850> for<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.540> creepy

that is it sorry for the really creepy
music<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> thought<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.310> was<00:02:29.000> fitting

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
music but I thought it was fitting

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.900 
music but I thought it was fitting
because<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.200> Halloween<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.950> stay<00:02:31.700> tuned
