remembering<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> emotions<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
remembering all the emotions and all the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
remembering all the emotions and all the
excitement<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> felt<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> watched

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
excitement I felt when I watched

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
excitement I felt when I watched
katakana<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.669> kid<00:00:32.880> those<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.570> feelings

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
katakana was a kid those same feelings

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630

watching<00:00:34.410> till<00:00:34.590> nutty<00:00:34.770> milk<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.190> scoop

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
watching till nutty milk I would scoop

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and that never happens it's probably

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
and that never happens it's probably
because<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> show<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.820> funny<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

sitting there asking yourself what's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.530 
sitting there asking yourself what's
going<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.149> everything<00:01:45.149> seems<00:01:45.360> really

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
going on and everything seems really

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
going on and everything seems really
natural<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.439> don't<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.770> feel<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.070> the
