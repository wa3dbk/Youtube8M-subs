00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.899
 the more alien you know the universal 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.640
 car mount we have this here now 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.680
 follow model in front of the camera rather 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 foreign plus that is already on Amazon 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 currently can be listed but believe 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.000
 I do not order yet 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 we thought we always just keep 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.599
 in front of the camera will go the same 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 a bit more rattling but short 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.490
 times the Eckdaten down what is there to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.109
 say 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.670
 the old frame he lent himself to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.769
 devices up to a screen diagonal 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 of 5 inches the new power does that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.039
 now up to 6 inches that means I can 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.210
 here these pull apart these 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.539
 spring in there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 which is now up to 15 2 cm on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 the old against them up to 12.7 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.680
 price point is currently but expectation 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.879
 listed for 29 euros I think there will 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 to turn a little bit to something 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.590
 the old one has cost around 20 euros 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.370
 or he still costs so he has them 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 about 1 is clocked 27 grams if 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 we take the matter in hand 7 x 5 x 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.050
 3 cm two and a half, I think big suits 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 So still in your pocket and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 I would say we go a little 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.739
 so that bit more we ran the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.690
 history also from the near 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.920
 can look at so you should the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 had not yet been in hand 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 it's such a rubbery mat 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 material with 25 can be relatively heavy like 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.960
 So one feels so finished 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 in hand 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.509
 and the clou is actually behind here 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.220
 this this element is there but 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.600
 also a bit flexible and we see 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 that we are fine we have here once 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.130
 a relatively wide recesses would like 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 that the rotary a relatively narrow the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 can be turned so that the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.659
 Angled accordingly stands for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.189
 front area I can now here 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.890
 so me in the lock 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 different rest stages and the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.130
 is there to lamella in the air 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.840
 car to be plugged depending on whether 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 you have thick air or report or rather 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.450
 the thinner ones are the stop 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.619
 according to one if the host one 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 then a bit diagonally mounted 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.810
 you can do this here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 for my sake, it's still so easy to angle 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.380
 and then you put it in the fan 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.960
 the lamellar purely we have times 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 a chipcard of my swedish 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.799
 camping map for the moment too 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.969
 demonstrate the whole thing is stuck 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.579
 because in there and keep the iphone 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.390
 in the front firm, the manufacturer says 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.250
 can the thing here also 16 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.990
 I use the video stand 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.950
 not such a friend of but as I said 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.330
 that would be a second 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.380
 application possibility and we look us 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.590
 that time with the iphone 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.700
 You just click that in here 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 is mother of the he frame attitudes 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.740
 Usually that's what keeps you sitting 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.190
 accordingly in the recess 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.780
 in front of the fan bracket and has 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.459
 just a proper train on it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.340
 see that I'm still such a leather 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.360
 Case threatens and can stop that 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.640
 to be taken away that is relative 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 handy if you drive my car to go 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.090
 to use all this kascelan 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.500
 stories can be used in the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.239
 have a bag and if you think so 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 Attitude needs to be plugged in 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.820
 never lamellas rhine feeds that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.860
 opens up the cellphone 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.120
 again as I said in contrast to 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.800
 predecessor model has not been very much there 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.519
 changed a lot it's easy now 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.350
 a bit bigger 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.060
 looking at the iphone 6 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.400
 probably quite a nice one 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.630
 nice plus also for the users or before 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.060
 all for the user he still one 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.170
 have case trainer and as we said 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.610
 Just wanted a video impression 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.340
 that's why he is here for it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.440
 a plus around 30 euros and his money 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.440
 Thank you for watching
