00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the Microtech tanki on - we are all

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:43.819 
the Microtech tanki on - we are all
familiar<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.730> blade<00:00:24.060> design<00:00:24.480> by<00:00:24.750> now

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.380 

most<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:45.039> the<00:00:45.219> material<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:45.730> taken<00:00:45.850> out<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.300> the

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
most of the material is taken out in the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.049 
most of the material is taken out in the
pivot<00:00:46.780> in<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.230> middle<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.190> handle<00:00:48.609> which

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
pivot in the middle of the handle which

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.819 
pivot in the middle of the handle which
means<00:00:49.300> there's<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.690> bit<00:00:49.899> more<00:00:50.079> weight<00:00:50.350> on<00:00:50.589> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
means there's a bit more weight on the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.509 
means there's a bit more weight on the
end<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.670> handle<00:00:52.120> also<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:53.170> blade<00:00:53.589> has<00:00:54.190> had

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
end of the handle also the blade has had

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.540 
end of the handle also the blade has had
some<00:00:54.969> holes<00:00:55.210> put<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.780> near<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.350> pivot<00:00:57.129> area

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
some holes put in it near the pivot area

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.219 
some holes put in it near the pivot area
which<00:00:57.909> takes<00:00:58.239> off<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.479> little<00:00:58.690> weight<00:00:58.899> here

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
which takes off a little weight here

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.109 
which takes off a little weight here
which<00:00:59.469> means<00:00:59.710> there's<00:00:59.979> a<00:01:00.190> bit<00:01:00.610> more<00:01:00.640> in<00:01:01.059> the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
which means there's a bit more in the

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.899 
which means there's a bit more in the
tip<00:01:01.869> of<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.049> blade<00:01:02.140> here<00:01:02.559> which<00:01:02.909> helps

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
tip of the blade here which helps

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.920 
tip of the blade here which helps
balance<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.330> out<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.449> little<00:01:04.659> bit<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:06.430> pivots

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
balance it out a little bit now pivots

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
balance it out a little bit now pivots
I'm<00:01:07.930> not<00:01:08.170> too<00:01:08.289> much<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.470> fan<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.799> they<00:01:09.640> do<00:01:09.700> use

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I'm not too much a fan of they do use

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.660 
I'm not too much a fan of they do use
focus<00:01:11.950> here<00:01:12.810> no<00:01:14.009> but<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.189> can<00:01:15.340> see<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.550> little

little<00:01:16.899> safety<00:01:17.289> Torx<00:01:17.770> bit<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.310> am<00:01:18.399> NOT<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> fan

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
little safety Torx bit so I am NOT a fan

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.020 
little safety Torx bit so I am NOT a fan
of<00:01:19.649> it's<00:01:20.649> not<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.830> bit<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.369> have<00:01:21.550> just<00:01:21.759> lying

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
of it's not a bit that I have just lying

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.010 
of it's not a bit that I have just lying
around<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.390> house<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.270> ends<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
around the house now the ends of the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.059 
around the house now the ends of the
handles<00:01:26.470> do<00:01:26.800> fall<00:01:27.369> just<00:01:28.090> shy<00:01:28.569> of<00:01:28.600> being<00:01:29.289> at<00:01:29.979> a

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
handles do fall just shy of being at a

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.910 
handles do fall just shy of being at a
perfect<00:01:30.520> weight<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.240> because<00:01:31.569> so<00:01:31.899> aerials<00:01:32.679> do

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
perfect weight and because so aerials do

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:57.670 
perfect weight and because so aerials do
tend<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.520> be<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.880> unpredictable

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.060 

I<00:01:58.450> love<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.750> last<00:01:59.990> design<00:02:00.350> they<00:02:00.470> did<00:02:00.650> on<00:02:00.770> here

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
I love the last design they did on here

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.030 
I love the last design they did on here
so<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:02.360> not<00:02:02.510> too<00:02:02.990> plain<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.710> not<00:02:03.830> too

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
so it's not too plain and it's not too

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.790 
so it's not too plain and it's not too
intricate<00:02:04.340> aníbal<00:02:04.850> allows<00:02:05.300> easy<00:02:06.290> roll<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
throwing it just right the the blade

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.070 
throwing it just right the the blade
will<00:02:55.730> stick<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> inside<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> handle

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
will stick to the inside of the handle

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:09.729 
will stick to the inside of the handle
and<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.260> won't<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.590> very<00:02:57.620> far<00:02:57.860> with<00:02:58.100> it

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.229 

now<00:03:10.739> tank<00:03:11.010> 2<00:03:11.190> really<00:03:11.459> does<00:03:11.610> play<00:03:11.879> well<00:03:12.090> with

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
now tank 2 really does play well with

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.930 
now tank 2 really does play well with
the<00:03:12.390> a/b<00:03:12.750> because<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.650> length<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.610> weight

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the a/b because the length and weight

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.649 
the a/b because the length and weight
are<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.870> similar<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:17.129> not<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.909> too<00:03:18.090> big<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
are so similar it's not not too big of a

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.600 
are so similar it's not not too big of a

the a B and you switch to the TAC 2 as

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.699 
the a B and you switch to the TAC 2 as
