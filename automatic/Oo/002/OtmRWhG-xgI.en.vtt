what if the only fire in our hands was a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.319 
what if the only fire in our hands was a
flare<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.260> fading<00:00:49.890> fast<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.180> instead

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
flare that's fading fast what if instead

flare that's fading fast what if instead
of<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> rocket<00:00:52.050> launcher<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.590> had<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
flashlight it's also fading very fast

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
flashlight it's also fading very fast
and<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.430> instead<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.789> making<00:00:57.149> us

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and what if instead of making us

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:18.300 
and what if instead of making us
powerful<00:00:57.710> they<00:00:58.710> made<00:00:58.890> us<00:00:59.010> hide

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820 

this<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.520> video<00:01:19.850> game<00:01:19.940> that's<00:01:20.930> not<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.620> video

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
this is a video game that's not a video

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.310 
this is a video game that's not a video
game<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.580> mean<00:01:23.120> obviously<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:23.960> video<00:01:24.230> game

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320

what<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:24.860> mean<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.280> it's<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.030> video<00:01:26.300> game<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
what I mean is it's a video game that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.990 
what I mean is it's a video game that
disregards<00:01:27.470> everything<00:01:27.980> about<00:01:28.280> video<00:01:28.700> games

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
disregards everything about video games

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.850 
disregards everything about video games
like<00:01:29.390> everything<00:01:29.870> they're<00:01:30.080> supposed<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.650> be

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
like everything they're supposed to be

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.280 
like everything they're supposed to be

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
it's not and and all the things I'd

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.780 
it's not and and all the things I'd
normally<00:01:33.470> think<00:01:33.920> about<00:01:34.010> when<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.340> review<00:01:34.760> a

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
normally think about when I review a

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.530 
normally think about when I review a
video<00:01:35.120> game

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
video game

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.780 
video game
they<00:01:36.020> don't<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:36.410> apply<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:37.670> in

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
they don't really apply here like in

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.420 
they don't really apply here like in
this<00:01:37.910> entire<00:01:38.300> game<00:01:38.360> there's<00:01:39.200> really<00:01:39.619> like<00:01:39.920> one

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
this entire game there's really like one

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.480 
this entire game there's really like one
real<00:01:40.790> enemy<00:01:41.330> that's<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.170> one<00:01:42.560> bad<00:01:42.890> guy<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
real enemy that's it one bad guy and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.820 
real enemy that's it one bad guy and
everything<00:01:43.729> happens<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.390> one<00:01:44.750> place<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
everything happens in one place so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.350 
everything happens in one place so
normally<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:46.580> where<00:01:46.729> I'd<00:01:46.850> say<00:01:47.090> something

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
normally this is where I'd say something

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.900 
normally this is where I'd say something
about<00:01:47.570> oh<00:01:47.930> there's<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.649> lack<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.040> enemies<00:01:49.190> me

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
about oh there's a lack of enemies me

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.139 
about oh there's a lack of enemies me
it's<00:01:50.060> more<00:01:50.270> diversity<00:01:51.040> game<00:01:52.040> review<00:01:52.460> but<00:01:53.000> that

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
it's more diversity game review but that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.120 
it's more diversity game review but that
one<00:01:53.420> enemy<00:01:53.660> happens<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.979> most

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
one enemy happens to be the most

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.150 
one enemy happens to be the most
daunting<00:01:55.490> game<00:01:56.149> enemy<00:01:56.630> ever<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.710> much<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.130> that

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
daunting game enemy ever so much so that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.980 
daunting game enemy ever so much so that

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
the first two alien movies that this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
the first two alien movies that this
just<00:03:03.620> makes<00:03:03.860> sense

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
just makes sense

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.490 
just makes sense
you<00:03:04.640> know<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.360> movie<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.840> gave<00:03:06.049> so<00:03:06.320> much

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
you know that a movie that gave so much

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.949 
you know that a movie that gave so much
to<00:03:06.560> video<00:03:06.980> games<00:03:07.280> would<00:03:07.790> continue<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.690> so

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
to video games would continue to do so

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.160 
to video games would continue to do so
only<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:10.040> time<00:03:10.370> through<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.850> video<00:03:11.269> huh<00:03:11.630> like

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
only this time through a video huh like

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.110 
only this time through a video huh like
that's<00:03:12.440> on<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> different<00:03:13.340> level<00:03:13.579> than<00:03:13.790> most

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
that's on a different level than most

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.569 
that's on a different level than most
movie<00:03:14.660> games<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.260> besides<00:03:15.590> most<00:03:15.920> movie<00:03:16.340> games

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
movie games and besides most movie games

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.170 
movie games and besides most movie games
go<00:03:16.910> for<00:03:17.209> okay<00:03:17.989> at<00:03:18.260> best<00:03:18.640> aliens<00:03:19.640> looking<00:03:19.970> for

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
go for okay at best aliens looking for

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:33.880 
go for okay at best aliens looking for
something<00:03:20.510> bigger<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.430> also<00:03:22.430> you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.240 

so<00:03:34.890> what<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.310> alien<00:03:35.910> isolation<00:03:36.150> well<00:03:37.250> well

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so what is alien isolation well well

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.640 
so what is alien isolation well well
actually<00:03:38.580> I'm<00:03:38.880> not<00:03:39.330> really<00:03:39.810> sure<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.380> mean

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
actually I'm not really sure I mean

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.800 
actually I'm not really sure I mean
technically<00:03:41.130> it's<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.430> stealth<00:03:41.700> game<00:03:41.810> but

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
technically it's a stealth game but

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.690 
technically it's a stealth game but
stealth<00:03:43.230> would<00:03:43.440> seem<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.770> imply<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.130> you're

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
stealth would seem to imply that you're

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
stealth would seem to imply that you're
sneaking<00:03:45.240> up<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.510> people<00:03:45.750> right<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.500> all

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
sneaking up on people right like all

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.530 
sneaking up on people right like all
your<00:03:46.830> you're<00:03:47.160> hiding<00:03:47.550> behind<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.970> Box<00:03:48.210> you're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
your you're hiding behind the Box you're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.120 
your you're hiding behind the Box you're
waiting<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.110> bad<00:03:49.290> guy<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> turn<00:03:49.830> around

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
waiting for the bad guy to turn around

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.800 
waiting for the bad guy to turn around
cuz<00:03:50.370> he's<00:03:50.550> on<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> timed<00:03:51.060> route<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.660> know

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
cuz he's on a timed route and you know

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.210 
cuz he's on a timed route and you know
he's<00:03:51.960> gonna<00:03:52.110> turn<00:03:52.350> around<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.890> then<00:03:53.070> you

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
he's gonna turn around and then you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.250 
he's gonna turn around and then you
knock<00:03:53.460> him<00:03:53.610> out<00:03:53.730> cold<00:03:53.810> like<00:03:54.810> that's<00:03:55.080> what

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
knock him out cold like that's what

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.990 
knock him out cold like that's what
stealth<00:03:55.530> implies<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.220> implies<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.700> you're

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
stealth implies it implies that you're

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.150 
stealth implies it implies that you're
the<00:03:57.180> hunter<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:58.140> could<00:03:58.500> not<00:03:58.770> be<00:03:58.800> further

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
the hunter that could not be further

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.700 
the hunter that could not be further
from<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.550> truth<00:03:59.580> in<00:04:00.030> alien<00:04:00.510> isolation<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:01.290> mean

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
from the truth in alien isolation I mean

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.260 
from the truth in alien isolation I mean
it<00:04:01.950> has<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.130> mechanics<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.970> stealth<00:04:03.210> game

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
it has the mechanics of a stealth game

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.690 
it has the mechanics of a stealth game
but<00:04:04.080> this<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> game<00:04:05.100> about<00:04:05.250> stealth

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
but this is not a game about stealth

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.180 
but this is not a game about stealth
it's<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.360> game<00:04:06.510> about<00:04:06.560> hiding<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> game

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it's a game about hiding it's a game

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.380 
it's a game about hiding it's a game
that<00:04:08.220> doesn't<00:04:08.640> patronize<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.360> with

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
that doesn't patronize you with

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.710 
that doesn't patronize you with
fantasies<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.260> power<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.920> strength

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
fantasies of power and strength

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.360 
fantasies of power and strength
there's<00:04:12.720> no<00:04:12.870> bravery<00:04:13.470> here<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:13.980> even<00:04:14.250> if

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
there's no bravery here and even if

there's issues with the AI and I mean

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.189 
there's issues with the AI and I mean
look<00:06:24.839> it<00:06:24.960> has<00:06:25.469> video<00:06:26.159> game<00:06:26.580> problems<00:06:27.330> like<00:06:28.169> I
