00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
pretty evident that it was a little

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.650 
pretty evident that it was a little
distracting<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.910> Gino<00:03:14.910> came<00:03:15.269> up<00:03:15.420> with<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.030 
distracting and Gino came up with the
idea<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.350> why<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.860> use<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
idea you know why don't we use a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.460 
idea you know why don't we use a
percussionist<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.150> know<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.390> drumbeat

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
could really we could really get them to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
could really we could really get them to
maybe<00:03:22.650> focus<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.430> follow<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.970> bit

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
maybe focus and follow a little bit

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.040 
maybe focus and follow a little bit
better<00:03:24.300> with<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> beat

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
better with the beat

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:37.170 
better with the beat
that<00:03:25.560> was<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.800> brainstorm

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.789 

one<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.360> biggest<00:03:38.629> challenges<00:03:39.170> was<00:03:39.409> trying

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
one of the biggest challenges was trying

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
to all of us trying to figure out how we

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.059 
to all of us trying to figure out how we
could<00:03:41.870> teach<00:03:42.049> them<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.439> learn<00:03:42.590> left<00:03:42.859> from

could teach them to learn left from

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.399 
could teach them to learn left from
right<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.579> we<00:03:44.540> tried<00:03:44.780> all<00:03:44.930> kinds<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.349> things

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.970 
syndrome don't like things on their body
and<00:03:50.599> so<00:03:50.840> they<00:03:50.989> would<00:03:51.140> pull<00:03:51.379> they<00:03:51.680> would<00:03:51.829> be

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
and so they would pull they would be

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.280 
and so they would pull they would be
pulling<00:03:52.219> them<00:03:52.459> off<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.939> we<00:03:53.510> tried<00:03:53.750> bells<00:03:54.019> on

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
pulling them off and we tried bells on

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
one hand that didn't work and then I did

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.319 
one hand that didn't work and then I did
get<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.230> idea<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.829> duct<00:03:58.760> tape<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:59.120> their

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
shoe so those were things that we

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.920 
shoe so those were things that we
started<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.229> really<00:04:43.090> make<00:04:44.090> us<00:04:44.300> realize<00:04:44.720> that

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
started to really make us realize that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.870 
started to really make us realize that
what<00:04:45.470> we<00:04:45.590> were<00:04:45.710> doing<00:04:45.740> was<00:04:46.190> actually<00:04:46.400> working

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
what we were doing was actually working

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.460 
what we were doing was actually working
because<00:04:47.120> once<00:04:47.479> you<00:04:47.630> understand<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.349> you're

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
because once you understand that you're

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.890 
because once you understand that you're
making<00:04:48.650> mistakes<00:04:49.220> then<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.580> can<00:04:49.760> fix<00:04:50.690> them

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
making mistakes then you can fix them

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.649 
making mistakes then you can fix them
and<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:52.159> know<00:04:52.280> me<00:04:52.550> making<00:04:53.060> mistake<00:04:53.449> was

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
and and you know me making mistake was

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.820 
and and you know me making mistake was
also<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.380> key<00:04:55.250> element<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:56.210> learning<00:04:57.110> because<00:04:57.680> I

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
also a key element of learning because I

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.939 
also a key element of learning because I
had<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.370> make<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:59.360> this<00:04:59.900> point<00:05:00.349> that<00:05:00.620> making

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
had to make this this point that making

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.189 
had to make this this point that making
a<00:05:01.010> mistake<00:05:01.159> was<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.639> good<00:05:01.970> thing<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.419> feeling
