watchtowers<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
watchtowers are kind of up on a up on a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
watchtowers are kind of up on a up on a
rise<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.750> watchtowers<00:02:01.350> are

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
rise a little bit these watchtowers are

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.340 
rise a little bit these watchtowers are
actually<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.390> ramps<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
actually down the ramps right here and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
actually down the ramps right here and
right<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.850> pretty<00:02:06.119> difficult

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
right here so it can be pretty difficult

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
right here so it can be pretty difficult
to<00:02:06.869> clinton<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.320> take<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:07.829> especially<00:02:08.340> if

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
to clinton to take them especially if

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.040 
to clinton to take them especially if
you<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.789> forces<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.690> trying<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you have forces up here trying to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.490 
you have forces up here trying to
assault<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.099> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
assault but it's a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.020 
assault but it's a
going<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.830> an<00:02:12.920> interesting<00:02:13.010> game<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.850> is

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
going to be an interesting game here is

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 
going to be an interesting game here is
this<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.570> probably<00:02:14.960> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> be<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.380> most

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this is probably going to be the most

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
this is probably going to be the most
contest<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.160> tower<00:02:16.370> between<00:02:16.730> these<00:02:16.880> two

contest to tower between these two

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.850 
contest to tower between these two
players<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.020> me<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.440> simple

you that let's actually look the players
here<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.100> see<00:02:25.190> Stefano<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.970> ahead<00:02:26.090> with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
here we can see Stefano going ahead with

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.120 
here we can see Stefano going ahead with
that<00:02:26.390> early<00:02:26.840> expansion<00:02:27.170> first<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:28.070> is

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that early expansion first this is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.040 
that early expansion first this is
something<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:28.790> pretty<00:02:29.090> popular<00:02:29.480> on<00:02:29.840> this

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
something that's pretty popular on this

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.050 
something that's pretty popular on this
map<00:02:30.260> because<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.160> could<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.670> overall

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
map because you could see the overall

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.140 
map because you could see the overall
map<00:02:32.270> size<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.750> big<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.830> very<00:02:34.280> freaking<00:02:34.880> big

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
map size is big it's very freaking big

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.850 
map size is big it's very freaking big
so<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> chances<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.500> above<00:02:36.740> your

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
so the chances of the above your

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.770 
so the chances of the above your
opponent<00:02:37.310> finding<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> are<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> little<00:02:38.570> bit

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
opponent finding you are a little bit

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.840 
opponent finding you are a little bit
lower<00:02:39.080> than<00:02:39.500> say<00:02:39.740> try<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.100> execute<00:02:40.550> this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
lower than say try to execute this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.570 
lower than say try to execute this
strategy<00:02:41.090> unzell<00:02:41.870> naga<00:02:42.110> caverns<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.490> I'm<00:02:43.550> not

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
strategy unzell naga caverns so I'm not

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.160 
strategy unzell naga caverns so I'm not
surprised<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.270> we<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.630> both<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> these

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
surprised that we have both of these

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.020 
surprised that we have both of these
players<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:46.010> for<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.400> early<00:02:46.670> expansion

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
players going for this early expansion

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.890 
players going for this early expansion
right<00:02:47.780> off<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.140> bat<00:02:48.550> now<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.820> see<00:02:50.000> gas<00:02:50.570> is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
right off the bat now we can see gas is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.360 
right off the bat now we can see gas is
pretty<00:02:51.560> similar<00:02:51.860> for<00:02:52.100> both<00:02:52.130> players

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
pretty similar for both players

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.550 
pretty similar for both players
obviously<00:02:52.900> demography<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> little

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
obviously demography to get it a little

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.170 
obviously demography to get it a little
bit<00:02:54.800> earlier<00:02:55.100> than<00:02:55.430> his<00:02:55.580> opponent<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.060> think

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
bit earlier than his opponent I think

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.220 
bit earlier than his opponent I think
it's<00:02:56.300> also<00:02:56.390> kind<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.690> interesting<00:02:57.080> he's

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
it's also kind of interesting he's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.600 
it's also kind of interesting he's
letting<00:02:57.530> his<00:02:57.620> money<00:02:57.830> kind<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.100> tick<00:02:58.280> up<00:02:58.430> there

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
letting his money kind of tick up there

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.520 
letting his money kind of tick up there
to<00:02:58.730> 400<00:02:59.209> probably<00:02:59.750> gonna<00:02:59.840> get<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.080> metabolic

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
to 400 probably gonna get the metabolic

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.070 
to 400 probably gonna get the metabolic
boost<00:03:00.650> upgrade<00:03:01.130> yep<00:03:01.400> switch<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.690> right

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
boost upgrade yep switch that on right

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.240 
boost upgrade yep switch that on right
there<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.560> then<00:03:03.739> probably<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.070> coincidence

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
there and then probably a coincidence

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.729 
there and then probably a coincidence
that<00:03:05.060> go<00:03:05.209> down<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.780> also<00:03:06.380> got<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> couple

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
that go down and also got a couple

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.680 
that go down and also got a couple
zerglings<00:03:07.220> heading<00:03:07.520> out<00:03:07.640> as<00:03:07.760> well<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
zerglings heading out as well so this is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.270 
zerglings heading out as well so this is
a<00:03:08.720> pretty<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> pretty<00:03:09.860> standard

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
a pretty this is a pretty standard

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.300 
a pretty this is a pretty standard
opening<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.820> do<00:03:11.239> like<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:12.800> looking<00:03:13.160> over

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
opening I do like that I'm looking over

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.949 
opening I do like that I'm looking over
here<00:03:13.400> stefano<00:03:13.790> actually<00:03:14.510> going<00:03:14.750> ahead

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
here stefano actually going ahead

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.289 
here stefano actually going ahead
immediately<00:03:15.860> upon<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.519> spawning<00:03:17.060> pools

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
immediately upon the spawning pools

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.900 
immediately upon the spawning pools
completion<00:03:17.870> dropping<00:03:18.590> down<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.860> roach<00:03:19.430> warren

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
completion dropping down a roach warren

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.460 
completion dropping down a roach warren
i<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.780> actually<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.110> very

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
i think this is actually a very

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.199 
i think this is actually a very
interesting<00:03:22.280> play<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.730> we're<00:03:22.850> going<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.000> see

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
interesting play that we're going to see

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.509 
interesting play that we're going to see
here<00:03:23.510> from<00:03:23.810> stefano<00:03:24.290> he<00:03:24.560> may<00:03:24.799> just<00:03:24.830> decide<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
here from stefano he may just decide to

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.270 
here from stefano he may just decide to
go<00:03:25.640> ahead<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.150> put<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> couple<00:03:27.320> drones<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.950> here

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
go ahead and put a couple drones on here

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.160 
go ahead and put a couple drones on here
and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:28.760> start<00:03:29.090> dedicating<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.049> the

and then start dedicating all of the
larvae<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.980> roaches<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.610> try<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.910> push<00:03:32.180> up

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
larvae to roaches and try to push up

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.199 
larvae to roaches and try to push up
damaja<00:03:33.890> over<00:03:34.459> here<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.790> can<00:03:34.820> see<00:03:35.030> he's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
damaja over here we can see he's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.360 
damaja over here we can see he's
actually<00:03:35.420> dropping<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:36.019> baneling<00:03:36.709> nest<00:03:37.130> right

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
actually dropping a baneling nest right

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.759 
actually dropping a baneling nest right
now<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.110> don't<00:03:39.200> know<00:03:39.410> how

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
now so this is just I don't know how

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.319 
now so this is just I don't know how
well<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.280> gonna<00:03:40.489> work<00:03:40.730> out<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.030> de<00:03:41.150> manga

well this is gonna work out for de manga
he<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.870> gonna<00:03:42.079> have<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.590> there<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.829> use

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
he is gonna have to get in there and use

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.190 
he is gonna have to get in there and use
these<00:03:43.519> banelings<00:03:44.000> before<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.750> roaches

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
these banelings before the roaches

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.590 
these banelings before the roaches
become<00:03:45.799> or<00:03:46.280> had<00:03:46.459> gained<00:03:46.790> too<00:03:47.030> heavy<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.390> a

scouting it out he sees all right
there's<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> expansion<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.340> what's<00:03:55.549> going<00:03:55.700> on

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
there's the expansion is what's going on

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.400 
there's the expansion is what's going on
with<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.030> he<00:03:56.420> may<00:03:56.600> decide<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.989> put<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> little

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
with that he may decide to put a little

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.170 
with that he may decide to put a little
bit<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.620> pressure<00:03:57.829> on<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.370> don't<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:58.700> his

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
bit of pressure on it I don't know his

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.670 
bit of pressure on it I don't know his
circling<00:03:59.660> speed<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.049> going<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.260> be<00:04:00.350> done<00:04:00.530> just

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
circling speed is going to be done just

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.160 
circling speed is going to be done just
a<00:04:00.829> tiny<00:04:01.130> bit<00:04:01.310> before<00:04:02.239> Stefano<00:04:02.630> but<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.930> don't

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
a tiny bit before Stefano but I don't

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.020 
a tiny bit before Stefano but I don't
think<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.470> gonna<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:03.739> such<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.220> big<00:04:04.430> gap<00:04:04.610> that

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
think it's gonna be such a big gap that

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.830 
think it's gonna be such a big gap that
it's<00:04:05.150> going<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.329> make<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.480> substantial

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
it's going to make a substantial

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.630 
it's going to make a substantial
difference<00:04:06.590> combine<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.220> with<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.549> fact

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
difference combine that with the fact

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.860 
difference combine that with the fact
that<00:04:07.910> you're<00:04:08.060> going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.269> have<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.480> roaches

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that you're going to have the roaches

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.660 
that you're going to have the roaches

going to run up the ramp like that
that's<00:04:18.350> just<00:04:18.410> another<00:04:18.769> thing<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.459> really

that's just another thing that is really
helpful<00:04:20.030> early<00:04:20.390> game<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.959> do<00:04:21.080> with<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
helpful early game to do with the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.860 
helpful early game to do with the
roaches<00:04:21.919> you<00:04:22.039> see<00:04:22.220> he's<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> he<00:04:23.210> has<00:04:23.419> indeed

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
roaches you see he's a he has indeed

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.330 
roaches you see he's a he has indeed
kind<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.200> cut<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.590> dream<00:04:24.860> production<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
kind of cut that dream production a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.140 
kind of cut that dream production a
little<00:04:25.550> bit<00:04:25.669> there

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
little bit there

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.850 
little bit there
so<00:04:26.300> let's<00:04:26.690> see<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:26.990> got<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.139> couple<00:04:27.290> roaches

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
so let's see we got a couple roaches

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.890 
so let's see we got a couple roaches
zergling<00:04:28.669> speed<00:04:28.970> is<00:04:29.150> finishing<00:04:29.540> up<00:04:29.720> for

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
zergling speed is finishing up for

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.450 
zergling speed is finishing up for
stefano<00:04:30.199> as<00:04:30.380> well<00:04:30.530> looks<00:04:30.919> like<00:04:31.040> he<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.280> going

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
stefano as well looks like he is going

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.640 
stefano as well looks like he is going
to<00:04:31.639> employ<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.210> wall<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.600> know<00:04:33.169> one<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
to employ that wall you know one of the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.279 
to employ that wall you know one of the
reasons<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:34.479> he's<00:04:35.479> probably<00:04:35.630> doing<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.110> is

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
reasons that he's probably doing this is

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.990 
reasons that he's probably doing this is
again<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.009> mentioned<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.490> previous<00:04:37.580> games

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
again like I mentioned in previous games

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.060 
again like I mentioned in previous games
you'll<00:04:38.570> see<00:04:38.810> there's<00:04:39.050> an<00:04:39.199> overlord<00:04:39.740> train

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
you'll see there's an overlord train

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.710 
you'll see there's an overlord train
coming<00:04:40.460> all<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.789> way<00:04:40.820> from<00:04:40.910> dimaggio<00:04:41.509> space

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
coming all the way from dimaggio space

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.050 
coming all the way from dimaggio space
so<00:04:42.289> Stefano<00:04:42.710> knows<00:04:43.009> way<00:04:43.490> ahead<00:04:43.699> of<00:04:43.910> time

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
so Stefano knows way ahead of time

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.120 
so Stefano knows way ahead of time
what's<00:04:44.630> going<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> be<00:04:44.960> coming<00:04:45.139> Adam<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:45.949> he

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
what's going to be coming Adam so he

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.680 
what's going to be coming Adam so he
knows<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.639> number<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.030> zerglings<00:04:47.419> are

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
knows that a number of zerglings are

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.540 
knows that a number of zerglings are
here<00:04:47.930> he<00:04:48.289> hasn't<00:04:48.710> actually<00:04:48.889> don't<00:04:49.280> think<00:04:49.460> he's

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
here he hasn't actually don't think he's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.240 
here he hasn't actually don't think he's
been<00:04:49.729> up<00:04:49.820> into<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.060> base<00:04:50.240> no<00:04:50.479> he<00:04:50.660> has<00:04:50.780> not<00:04:51.250> so

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
been up into the base no he has not so

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.730 
been up into the base no he has not so
he<00:04:52.400> doesn't<00:04:52.789> he<00:04:53.630> doesn't<00:04:53.660> know<00:04:54.199> unless<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
banelings more for it every her in the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.850 
banelings more for it every her in the
edge<00:04:56.090> i<00:04:56.270> don't<00:04:56.419> think<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.750> Damaja<00:04:57.289> actually

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
edge i don't think that Damaja actually

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.219 
edge i don't think that Damaja actually
did<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.220> but<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.210> he's<00:04:59.360> probably<00:04:59.600> expecting

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
did that but so he's probably expecting

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.930 
did that but so he's probably expecting
the<00:05:00.350> zerglings<00:05:00.590> maybe<00:05:01.070> not<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.400> banelings<00:05:01.820> i

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
the zerglings maybe not the banelings i

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.640 
the zerglings maybe not the banelings i
don't<00:05:02.090> know<00:05:02.180> either<00:05:02.389> way<00:05:02.630> roche<00:05:03.139> position

don't know either way roche position

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.159 
don't know either way roche position
here<00:05:03.889> very<00:05:04.310> solid<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.910> Nelda<00:05:05.810> maaga<00:05:05.990> is

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.779 
here very solid and Nelda maaga is
actually<00:05:06.500> going<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.650> be<00:05:06.710> taking<00:05:07.039> out<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.580> set

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
actually going to be taking out the set

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.879 
actually going to be taking out the set
of<00:05:07.880> destructible<00:05:08.330> debris<00:05:08.690> that<00:05:09.169> prevents

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
access from the third base think that's

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.629 
access from the third base think that's
a<00:05:11.960> little<00:05:12.050> interesting<00:05:12.560> here<00:05:12.770> but<00:05:13.160> we<00:05:13.280> see<00:05:13.490> de
