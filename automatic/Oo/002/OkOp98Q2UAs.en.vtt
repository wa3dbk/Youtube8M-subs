bumblebee<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:56.570> think<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> biggest<00:01:57.840> feature<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bumblebee I think the biggest feature is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
bumblebee I think the biggest feature is
probably<00:01:58.860> his<00:01:58.979> wings<00:01:59.250> that's<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> biggest

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
probably his wings that's the biggest

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.609 
probably his wings that's the biggest
thing<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.810> different<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> our

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
thing that's different from all of our

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.359 
thing that's different from all of our
other<00:02:01.680> bumblebee<00:02:02.399> things<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.090> uh<00:02:04.100> his<00:02:05.100> wings

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
in transformers prime his wings are
unlike<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> movie<00:02:18.569> bumblebee<00:02:19.020> he<00:02:19.410> looks

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
unlike like the movie bumblebee he looks

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
unlike like the movie bumblebee he looks
a<00:02:19.740> lot<00:02:19.950> similar<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.970> movie<00:02:21.209> bumblebee<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
a lot similar to the movie bumblebee and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300 
a lot similar to the movie bumblebee and
the<00:02:21.930> cars<00:02:22.110> pretty<00:02:22.319> much<00:02:22.470> exactly<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.950> same

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the cars pretty much exactly the same

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510 
the cars pretty much exactly the same
but<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.630> biggest<00:02:24.900> difference<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.220> fact

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
but the biggest difference is the fact

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.930 
but the biggest difference is the fact
that<00:02:26.790> his<00:02:28.160> he<00:02:29.160> doesn't<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.520> radio<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
that his he doesn't use the radio to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.059 
that his he doesn't use the radio to
talk<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.630> Transformers<00:02:31.530> Prime<00:02:31.739> which<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
talk in the Transformers Prime which I

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.740 
talk in the Transformers Prime which I
thought<00:02:32.190> was<00:02:32.310> weird<00:02:32.580> he<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.120> bleeps<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
thought was weird he just bleeps and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
thought was weird he just bleeps and
bloops<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:35.120> his<00:02:36.120> wings<00:02:36.770> stick<00:02:37.770> out<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.980> his

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
bloops and his wings stick out of his

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.449 
bloops and his wings stick out of his
shoulders<00:02:39.060> sort<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:41.100> sort<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
shoulders sort of like they sort of

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.370 
shoulders sort of like they sort of
launched<00:02:41.850> out<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> side<00:02:42.750> i<00:02:42.780> guess<00:02:43.940> um<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.989> I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
launched out to the side i guess um so I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.060 
launched out to the side i guess um so I
guess<00:02:46.470> leave<00:02:46.769> me<00:02:46.920> more<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:49.230> sort<00:02:49.950> of

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
guess leave me more like that sort of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.190 
guess leave me more like that sort of
thing<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.540> can't<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.870> because<00:02:51.989> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
thing but we can't do that because it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.960 
thing but we can't do that because it
interferes<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> arms<00:02:53.310> but

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
interferes with the arms but

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.690 
interferes with the arms but
realistically<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.600> more<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.530> guess

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.370 

anyways<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.420> yeah<00:03:00.450> his<00:03:00.810> door<00:03:01.050> wings<00:03:01.230> would

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
anyways so yeah his door wings would

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.150 
anyways so yeah his door wings would
stick<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.690> um<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.930> he<00:03:04.769> uses

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
stick out more like that um and he uses

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.390 
stick out more like that um and he uses
a<00:03:05.190> binocular<00:03:05.580> piece<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.420> his<00:03:07.050> torso<00:03:07.470> II<00:03:07.680> area

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
a binocular piece on his torso II area

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.479 
a binocular piece on his torso II area
and<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:10.200> all<00:03:10.319> gonna<00:03:10.440> feet<00:03:10.650> her<00:03:11.640> ankles<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.510> guess

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and we all gonna feet her ankles I guess

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.479 
and we all gonna feet her ankles I guess
he<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.610> switch<00:03:14.790> piece<00:03:15.030> head<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:16.830> guys<00:03:17.250> can

yeah I guess we'll show you how we
attach<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.440> how<00:03:28.620> Daniel<00:03:29.040> Daniel<00:03:29.370> made<00:03:29.610> this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
attach or how Daniel Daniel made this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.310 
attach or how Daniel Daniel made this
one<00:03:29.940> attached<00:03:32.180> though<00:03:33.180> wings<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:34.079> basically

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
one attached though wings it's basically

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.580 
one attached though wings it's basically
just<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.769> our<00:03:34.860> hand<00:03:35.070> pieces<00:03:36.079> attached<00:03:37.079> to

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
just one of our hand pieces attached to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.160 
just one of our hand pieces attached to
one<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.040> stud<00:03:38.549> clips<00:03:38.910> with<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> vent<00:03:39.989> piece

one of the stud clips with a vent piece

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.650 
one of the stud clips with a vent piece
on<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> sticks<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.370> all<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.510> way<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
on so that it sticks out all the way to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.759 
on so that it sticks out all the way to
the<00:03:42.840> side<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.690> more<00:03:45.930> like<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.290> larger

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
the side to look more like the larger

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.400 
the side to look more like the larger
shoulders<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.579> bumblebee<00:03:47.970> has<00:03:48.359> in<00:03:48.959> tris
