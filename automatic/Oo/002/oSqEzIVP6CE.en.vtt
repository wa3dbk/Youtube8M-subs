00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
each paramotor is powder coated so part

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.940 
each paramotor is powder coated so part
of<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.670> powder<00:04:55.880> coating<00:04:56.420> process<00:04:56.450> is<00:04:57.140> heating

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
of the powder coating process is heating

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.970 
of the powder coating process is heating
up<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.280> painted<00:04:58.880> material<00:04:59.480> so<00:04:59.900> that<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.350> cures

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
up the painted material so that it cures

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.310 
up the painted material so that it cures
so<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.700> is<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.880> custom-made<00:05:02.420> oven<00:05:02.900> that<00:05:03.050> all

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
so this is a custom-made oven that all

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.860 
so this is a custom-made oven that all
the<00:05:03.530> paramotor<00:05:03.920> parts<00:05:04.400> go<00:05:04.550> into<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.510> make<00:05:05.690> sure

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
the paramotor parts go into to make sure

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.150 
the paramotor parts go into to make sure
that<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.170> paint<00:05:06.760> sticks<00:05:07.760> well<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.450> actual

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
that the paint sticks well to the actual

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.220 
that the paint sticks well to the actual
aluminum<00:05:10.160> in<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.120> back<00:05:11.300> here<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:11.720> where<00:05:11.750> the
