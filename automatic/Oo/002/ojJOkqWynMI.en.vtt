00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and I think that as we see with a lot of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
and I think that as we see with a lot of
schools<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> rebuilding

schools that are in that rebuilding

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
schools that are in that rebuilding
phase<00:00:45.559> where<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.370> make<00:00:47.789> things

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
phase where do they go to make things

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
phase where do they go to make things
happen<00:00:48.210> first<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.899> defense<00:00:49.320> how<00:00:49.500> many<00:00:49.710> of

second best defense in the nation in I
think<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:18.140> their<00:02:19.140> offenses<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.460> what

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
think that their offenses this is what

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.440 
think that their offenses this is what
they're<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.300> other

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
they're going to see in other

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.480 
they're going to see in other
conferences<00:02:21.960> okay<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.560> maybe<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> little

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
conferences okay so maybe it's a little

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.250 
conferences okay so maybe it's a little
skewed<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> personnel<00:02:25.080> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
skewed but just I like the personnel and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.390 
skewed but just I like the personnel and
I<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> what<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.740> okay<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> think

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
I like what they do okay and I think

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
number one in the irony of the stoops

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.760 
number one in the irony of the stoops
making<00:02:30.330> these<00:02:30.420> comments<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.500> know<00:02:31.620> now

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
making these comments and you know now

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.310 
making these comments and you know now
here<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.520> again<00:02:32.670> yeah<00:02:33.570> yeah<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.020> think

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
here we go again yeah yeah I think

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.630 
here we go again yeah yeah I think
they're<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.650> fast<00:02:34.830> defensive<00:02:35.250> country<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
they're all fast defensive country and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640 
they're all fast defensive country and
this<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> classic<00:02:36.209> example<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.930> when<00:02:37.500> your

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is the classic example of when your

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.360 
this is the classic example of when your
offense<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.670> bad<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.470> when<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> they<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
offense is so bad and when and they have

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.040 
offense is so bad and when and they have
looked<00:02:41.580> whore<00:02:41.880> might<00:02:42.330> be<00:02:42.510> getting<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> little

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
looked whore might be getting a little

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.870 
looked whore might be getting a little
bit<00:02:43.320> better<00:02:43.530> with<00:02:43.709> Tyler<00:02:44.070> Murphy<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.550> little

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
bit better with Tyler Murphy a little

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
bit better with Tyler Murphy a little
maybe<00:02:45.030> we'll<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:45.720> right<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.860> this

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
see them at some point in a big game I

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.729 
see them at some point in a big game I
think<00:04:15.630> we'll<00:04:15.750> all<00:04:15.780> find<00:04:16.140> out<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.440> how<00:04:16.590> good

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
think we'll all find out just how good

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.409 
think we'll all find out just how good
that<00:04:16.859> defense<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.000> don't<00:04:18.180> have<00:04:18.239> any

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that defense is so we don't have any

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.539 
that defense is so we don't have any
that<00:04:18.630> are<00:04:18.750> similar<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.470> last<00:04:19.620> three<00:04:20.100> you

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
