like a thorn undersea account numbers

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.080 
like a thorn undersea account numbers
numbers<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:25.069> there's<00:02:25.249> only<00:02:25.370> two<00:02:25.579> in<00:02:25.790> Israel

separately or you have to hold entire
equation<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.469> it<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.819> it's<00:02:31.999> very<00:02:32.120> confusing

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
equation of it so it's very confusing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.459 
equation of it so it's very confusing
but<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:34.579> conclusion<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.689> question<00:02:36.349> at

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
but to the conclusion the question at

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.199 
but to the conclusion the question at
the<00:02:36.560> end<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.219> basically<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.849> term

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
the end of this is basically is a term

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.589 
the end of this is basically is a term
