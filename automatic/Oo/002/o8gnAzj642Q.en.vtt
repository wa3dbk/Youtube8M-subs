spinning rails so in fall 2013 you're
going<00:00:22.279> to<00:00:22.340> need<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.580> see<00:00:22.850> a<00:00:22.880> new<00:00:23.029> spinning<00:00:23.330> reel

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
going to need to see a new spinning reel

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.600 
going to need to see a new spinning reel
in<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.570> market<00:00:23.840> from<00:00:23.930> us<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.400> position<00:00:25.400> wise

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
in the market from us and position wise

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.330 
in the market from us and position wise
it<00:00:26.090> fits<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.600> kind<00:00:27.290> of<00:00:27.380> above<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.770> battle

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
it fits in kind of above the battle

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.400 
it fits in kind of above the battle
below<00:00:28.610> the<00:00:28.790> conquer<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.720> doesn't<00:00:30.259> really

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
below the conquer it doesn't really

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.260 
below the conquer it doesn't really
compare<00:00:30.770> with<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.340> spin<00:00:31.550> Fisher<00:00:31.849> V<00:00:32.029> that's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
compare with the spin Fisher V that's

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.640 
compare with the spin Fisher V that's
kind<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.660> different<00:00:32.840> animal<00:00:33.260> more<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.560> a

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
kind of a different animal more of a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.740 
kind of a different animal more of a
near<00:00:33.860> shore<00:00:34.100> offshore<00:00:34.640> style<00:00:35.060> reel<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.390> little

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
near shore offshore style reel a little

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.280 
near shore offshore style reel a little
heavier<00:00:35.990> duty<00:00:36.350> bigger<00:00:36.680> drag<00:00:37.660> you<00:00:38.660> know<00:00:38.810> bigger

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
heavier duty bigger drag you know bigger

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.130 
heavier duty bigger drag you know bigger
built<00:00:39.650> reel<00:00:39.920> heavier<00:00:40.400> duty<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.570> conflict

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
built reel heavier duty so the conflict

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.400 
built reel heavier duty so the conflict
is<00:00:42.320> more<00:00:43.660> designed<00:00:44.660> for<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.079> that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
is more designed for that that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.250 
is more designed for that that
lightweight<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:47.030> short<00:00:47.390> technical<00:00:47.660> angler

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
lightweight in short technical angler

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.319 
lightweight in short technical angler
although<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.039> do<00:00:49.219> go<00:00:49.370> up<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.730> larger<00:00:50.090> sizes

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
although we do go up to the larger sizes

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.040 
although we do go up to the larger sizes
so<00:00:51.230> we<00:00:51.500> are<00:00:51.739> going<00:00:51.859> to<00:00:51.949> make<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> 1000<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.120> 2000

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
so we are going to make a 1000 a 2000

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.369 
so we are going to make a 1000 a 2000
2500<00:00:54.800> which<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.550> new<00:00:55.789> size<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.329> us<00:00:56.359> a<00:00:56.629> lot<00:00:57.260> of

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
2500 which is a new size for us a lot of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.470 
2500 which is a new size for us a lot of
the<00:00:57.440> guys<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:58.070> are<00:00:58.579> fishing<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.179> really

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
the guys that are fishing that really

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.860 
the guys that are fishing that really
light<00:00:59.719> you<00:00:59.750> know<00:01:00.079> 10<00:01:00.410> pound<00:01:00.679> braided<00:01:00.980> line

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
light you know 10 pound braided line

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.350 
light you know 10 pound braided line

their reels out on real lightweight rods

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.090 
their reels out on real lightweight rods
we<00:01:08.660> consider<00:01:08.990> those<00:01:09.140> guys<00:01:09.350> more<00:01:09.560> technical

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we consider those guys more technical

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600 
we consider those guys more technical
finesse<00:01:10.430> style<00:01:10.610> inshore<00:01:11.270> anglers<00:01:11.660> and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
finesse style inshore anglers and

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.130 
finesse style inshore anglers and
jumping<00:01:13.610> from<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.940> 2<00:01:14.120> to<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.330> 3<00:01:14.540> impasse<00:01:14.900> was

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
jumping from the 2 to the 3 impasse was

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.560 
jumping from the 2 to the 3 impasse was
was<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> pretty<00:01:15.830> big<00:01:15.980> jump<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:16.970> we've<00:01:17.270> added

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
was a pretty big jump so we've added

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.170 
was a pretty big jump so we've added
this<00:01:17.810> 2500<00:01:18.560> size<00:01:18.740> we've<00:01:19.130> increased<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.820> line

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
this 2500 size we've increased the line

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.810 
this 2500 size we've increased the line
capacity<00:01:20.689> on<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.960> 3<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:21.439> slightly<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:22.790> make

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
capacity on the 3 just slightly to make

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.569 
capacity on the 3 just slightly to make
room<00:01:23.210> for<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.509> 2500<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.409> 4000<00:01:25.100> stays<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
room for the 2500 the 4000 stays the

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.090 
room for the 2500 the 4000 stays the
same<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> little<00:01:26.840> bit<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.439> shake-up<00:01:27.829> from

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
same so a little bit of a shake-up from

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.190 
same so a little bit of a shake-up from
a<00:01:28.130> sizing<00:01:29.090> standpoint<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.869> conflict

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
a sizing standpoint on the conflict

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380 
a sizing standpoint on the conflict
series<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.100> have<00:01:31.189> our<00:01:31.340> standard<00:01:31.549> 5<00:01:32.000> we've

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
series then we have our standard 5 we've

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.149 
series then we have our standard 5 we've
increased<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.899> line<00:01:33.110> capacity<00:01:33.619> on<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> 6

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
increased the line capacity on the 6

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.789 
increased the line capacity on the 6
slightly<00:01:34.700> we've<00:01:35.240> got<00:01:35.420> rid<00:01:35.659> of<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.869> 7000<00:01:36.619> size

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
slightly we've got rid of the 7000 size

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.810 
slightly we've got rid of the 7000 size
and<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.460> we<00:01:37.729> end<00:01:37.880> up<00:01:38.090> at<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.390> 8,000<00:01:39.049> size<00:01:39.820> so

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
and we we end up at the 8,000 size so

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.969 
and we we end up at the 8,000 size so
what<00:01:41.060> makes<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.420> reel<00:01:41.659> different<00:01:42.200> from<00:01:42.500> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
what makes this reel different from the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.580 
what makes this reel different from the
battle<00:01:43.549> or<00:01:43.790> fierce<00:01:44.630> or<00:01:44.810> whatever<00:01:45.079> whatever

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
battle or fierce or whatever whatever

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.709 
battle or fierce or whatever whatever
you<00:01:45.740> want<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> compare<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.540> we've<00:01:47.540> adjusted

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
you want to compare it to we've adjusted

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.819 
you want to compare it to we've adjusted
the<00:01:48.640> oscillation<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:49.850> well<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.689> line<00:01:51.590> lay

the oscillation as well as the line lay
on<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.189> reel<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.640> we've<00:01:52.880> done<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.270> by<00:01:53.420> by

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
on the reel and we've done that by by

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.749 
on the reel and we've done that by by
altering<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.619> dimensions<00:01:55.219> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> spool<00:01:55.729> a

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
altering the dimensions of the spool a

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.469 
altering the dimensions of the spool a
little<00:01:56.030> bit<00:01:56.149> we've<00:01:56.719> also<00:01:56.930> changed<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
little bit we've also changed the

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.060 
little bit we've also changed the
dimensions<00:01:59.479> on<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.049> spool<00:02:00.320> lip<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.619> little<00:02:00.920> bit

dimensions on the spool lip a little bit

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.609 
dimensions on the spool lip a little bit
we've<00:02:01.700> done<00:02:01.939> this<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.420> enhance<00:02:02.840> cast<00:02:03.110> ability

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
we've done this to enhance cast ability

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.980 
we've done this to enhance cast ability
or<00:02:03.860> improve<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.939> line<00:02:05.119> management<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.869> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
on our conventional rails we've now

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.130 
on our conventional rails we've now
pulled<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.220> spinning<00:02:58.580> reels<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:59.810> did<00:02:59.990> that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
pulled in the spinning reels we did that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.960 
pulled in the spinning reels we did that
on<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.410> torque<00:03:00.650> rail<00:03:00.800> as<00:03:00.980> well<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.820> we've

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
on the torque rail as well so we've

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.990 
on the torque rail as well so we've
keyed<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.500> drive<00:03:03.500> washers<00:03:03.950> into<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.670> spool

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
keyed the drive washers into the spool

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.180 
keyed the drive washers into the spool
which<00:03:05.240> is<00:03:05.420> allowing<00:03:06.290> us<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.440> use<00:03:06.560> both<00:03:06.920> sides

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
which is allowing us to use both sides

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.100 
which is allowing us to use both sides
of<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.460> drag<00:03:07.670> washers<00:03:08.120> given<00:03:08.510> us<00:03:08.630> more<00:03:08.810> max

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
of the drag washers given us more max

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.140 
of the drag washers given us more max
drag<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.530> about<00:03:09.710> 20<00:03:09.980> 20<00:03:10.430> percent<00:03:10.730> more<00:03:10.910> than

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
drag so about 20 20 percent more than

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.350 
drag so about 20 20 percent more than
the<00:03:11.270> battle<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:13.160> we've<00:03:13.370> reduced<00:03:13.520> weight<00:03:14.030> we've

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
the battle so we've reduced weight we've

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.000 
the battle so we've reduced weight we've
increased<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.960> drag<00:03:15.200> pressure<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.650> little<00:03:15.890> bit

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
increased the drag pressure a little bit

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.520 
increased the drag pressure a little bit
we've<00:03:16.190> added<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.670> new<00:03:16.790> 25-hundred<00:03:17.570> size<00:03:17.750> we

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
we've added a new 25-hundred size we

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.740 
we've added a new 25-hundred size we
have<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.680> seven<00:03:19.160> plus<00:03:19.400> one<00:03:19.520> bearing<00:03:20.090> system<00:03:20.570> and

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
have a seven plus one bearing system and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.560 
have a seven plus one bearing system and
the<00:03:21.080> bearings<00:03:21.440> are<00:03:21.620> all<00:03:21.860> sealed<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.210> we<00:03:23.360> have

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
the bearings are all sealed so we have

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.080 
the bearings are all sealed so we have
two<00:03:23.960> on<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> main<00:03:24.440> gear<00:03:24.710> two<00:03:25.580> on<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.880> pinion

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
two on the main gear two on the pinion

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.990 
two on the main gear two on the pinion
gear<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:27.350> have<00:03:27.530> two<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.190> handle<00:03:28.520> knob<00:03:28.670> and

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
gear we have two on the handle knob and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.060 
gear we have two on the handle knob and
we<00:03:29.390> have<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.840> underneath<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.500> spool<00:03:30.770> just

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
we have one underneath the spool just

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.979 
we have one underneath the spool just
like<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.340> battle<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:31.820> there's<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.060> seal

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
like the battle so there's a seal

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.530 
like the battle so there's a seal
bearing<00:03:33.380> underneath<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.830> spool<00:03:34.100> that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
bearing underneath the spool that

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.699 
bearing underneath the spool that
reduces<00:03:35.540> friction<00:03:35.750> when<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.140> drag<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.470> paying

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
reduces friction when the drag is paying

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.690 
reduces friction when the drag is paying
out<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.910> we've<00:03:38.150> got<00:03:38.770> sealed<00:03:39.770> bearings<00:03:40.340> better

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
out so we've got sealed bearings better

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.820 
out so we've got sealed bearings better
drag<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.420> little<00:03:41.570> bit<00:03:41.810> lighter<00:03:42.080> weight<00:03:42.320> we've

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
drag a little bit lighter weight we've

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.590 
drag a little bit lighter weight we've
