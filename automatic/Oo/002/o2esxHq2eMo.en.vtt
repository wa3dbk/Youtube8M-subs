00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
massive scale well ever since then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.380 
massive scale well ever since then
worldwide<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.090> causes

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
worldwide and that is what causes

inflation<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.130> loss<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.640> purchasing

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
inflation and the loss of purchasing

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
inflation and the loss of purchasing
power<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:36.960> thinking<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.560> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
power so people thinking that they can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.050 
power so people thinking that they can
retire

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
next one it became interchange so let me

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.229 
next one it became interchange so let me
ask<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.860> printing<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.610> money<00:02:36.000> out

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.910 
ask you this this printing of money out
of<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.540> paper<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.200> has<00:02:37.319> been<00:02:37.500> tried<00:02:37.739> before

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
of just paper this has been tried before

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.440 
of just paper this has been tried before
isn't<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:39.049> many<00:02:40.049> many<00:02:40.769> many<00:02:41.730> times<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
isn't it many many many times and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.620 
isn't it many many many times and
there's<00:02:42.989> always<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.290> result<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.239> far

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
there's always one result you get far

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.890 
there's always one result you get far
far<00:02:45.660> higher<00:02:46.459> prices<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.640> everything<00:02:48.329> but

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
far higher prices of everything but

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.539 
far higher prices of everything but
especially<00:02:48.930> real<00:02:49.650> money<00:02:49.920> when<00:02:50.160> they<00:02:50.280> start

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
especially real money when they start

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.160 
especially real money when they start
creating<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.120> whole<00:02:51.359> lot<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.690> currency

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
creating a whole lot of currency

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.590 
creating a whole lot of currency
eventually<00:02:52.920> gold<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.670> silver<00:02:53.940> lie<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.359> wait

eventually gold and silver lie in wait

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
eventually gold and silver lie in wait
and<00:02:54.959> then<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.890> public<00:02:56.190> senses<00:02:56.609> this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
and then when the public senses this

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.870 
and then when the public senses this
inflation<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.410> retail<00:02:59.100> prices<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.730> is

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
Lido this doesn't buy anything today

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.819 
Lido this doesn't buy anything today
doesn't<00:03:46.970> buy<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> cup<00:03:48.640> no<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.909> fact<00:03:50.620> they<00:03:51.620> have

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
doesn't buy a cup no in fact they have

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.990 
doesn't buy a cup no in fact they have
ruined<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.190> by<00:03:52.340> putting<00:03:52.549> ink<00:03:52.849> on<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.269> can't

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
ruined it by putting ink on it you can't

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.819 
ruined it by putting ink on it you can't
you<00:03:56.000> can't<00:03:56.239> write<00:03:56.420> all<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.230> there<00:03:57.470> it

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
you can't write all this so there it

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.319 
you can't write all this so there it
would<00:03:58.159> have<00:03:58.190> been<00:03:58.280> more<00:03:58.549> valuable<00:03:58.760> at<00:03:59.150> this

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
would have been more valuable at this

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.360 
would have been more valuable at this
point<00:03:59.599> if<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.810> was<00:03:59.930> black<00:04:00.109> right<00:04:00.379> so<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
point if it was black right so the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.009 
point if it was black right so the
Greeks<00:04:01.879> did<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.389> same<00:04:02.599> thing<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:02.930> they

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
Greeks did the same thing when they

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.720 
Greeks did the same thing when they
started<00:04:03.290> flipping<00:04:03.680> coins<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.400> take<00:04:04.549> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
started flipping coins is just take the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.710 
started flipping coins is just take the
silver<00:04:05.060> off<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.420> it

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
silver off of it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.080 
silver off of it
the<00:04:05.959> Romans<00:04:06.409> ride<00:04:06.709> up<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.159> english<00:04:07.609> tried<00:04:07.909> it

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the Romans ride up the english tried it

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.059 
the Romans ride up the english tried it
the<00:04:08.269> Germans<00:04:08.720> tried<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.319> Chinese<00:04:09.560> try<00:04:10.010> it

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
the Germans tried it the Chinese try it

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.240 
the Germans tried it the Chinese try it
and<00:04:10.700> now<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.000> u.s.<00:04:11.389> is<00:04:11.599> trying<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.010> that's

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
and now the u.s. is trying and so that's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430 
and now the u.s. is trying and so that's
why<00:04:13.489> saving<00:04:14.120> money<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.690> probably<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.170> biggest

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
why saving money is probably the biggest

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.439 
why saving money is probably the biggest
mistake<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:16.039> can<00:04:16.160> make<00:04:16.220> right<00:04:16.639> now<00:04:16.669> because

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
mistake you can make right now because
