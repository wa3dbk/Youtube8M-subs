00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
looking at the wind shear map you can

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.430 
looking at the wind shear map you can
see<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.910> it's<00:02:03.090> been<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> baiting<00:02:03.900> slightly

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440

we<00:02:12.120> could<00:02:12.360> possibly<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.930> some<00:02:13.110> interference

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we could possibly see some interference

so trying to form at the moment not too
well<00:03:24.330> defined<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:25.770> about<00:03:26.250> see

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
well defined but you can just about see

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.090 
well defined but you can just about see
it<00:03:26.870> beginning<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.020> develop<00:03:28.170> towards<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
center of the storm there looks like the

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.970 
center of the storm there looks like the
most<00:03:32.160> potent<00:03:32.820> area<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.830> thunderstorms<00:03:34.830> and

right<00:03:36.930> now<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.410> was<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.770> east<00:03:38.010> earlier

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
right now but it was on the east earlier

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.690 
right now but it was on the east earlier
just<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.209> few<00:03:39.239> hours<00:03:39.660> ago<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.260> will<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
just a few hours ago so that will be a

fluctuate quite a lot I imagine most of
