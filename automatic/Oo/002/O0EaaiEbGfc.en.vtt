00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 while I waited for it we hope for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.390
 to start this time for this price 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 last group selection in 2010 to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.190
 the pits place but what are we going 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.750
 this time it looks good with a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.400
 very good start from number 5 to turkey 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 and castle one of the favorites that is very 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 well gone so at the first level with 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 also expected is number 3 which has 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 got off to a good start and we have to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 sure to go very fast for young people from 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 review very quickly the 5 and 6 to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 produce footbuzz of a road at 17h no 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.599
 be it done to access 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.949
 parties very quickly with astor duquette 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.840
 jean michel bazire number 5 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.099
 aladdin d'ecajeul in second position 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.750
 we got in his wake with 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 aldo des chirac islands of cape vert is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 already 4th and then a competitor of 25 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 meters to know where one of the lan the number 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 15 who are already very well positioned in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.899
 five or sixth position but for 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.579
 the moment these are the horses of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 sebastian guarato a tale the best 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.010
 in this selection price with doncaster 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.660
 from wharf number 3 which is more 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 associated with jean-michel bazire alan diesel 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 number 5 with eric raffin 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.070
 comes in second position in front of number 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 aldo deschamps associated with matthieu 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.590
 abrivard who is 3rd a small break 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.149
 behind to find the rest of the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.620
 platoon rowing and especially by the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.270
 number 7 to whom even ducas berthier there in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 fifth position case with that too 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 not very far from him the number 2 alesia 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.189
 of trumps that comes along the rope 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.689
 whereas we see that number 15 of 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.460
 land of Baden actually ends up 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.229
 really very well placed already olive 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.820
 yes especially since he has a back to Kim Cape 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.049
 green everything is probably going to bring them very 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.220
 at length we went very quickly with 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.659
 young people we did not think they 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 would go so fast what explains for 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.570
 the moment we do not come back with 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.159
 the old ones we're probably going a little 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 little delay in the rising part 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.950
 of the test because we left very quickly 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 with astor duquesne harm three who 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.710
 take his workout companion 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 number 5 aladdin and kajol aldo 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.409
 deschamps a good intimate course of cape 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.579
 green the set is getting closer in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.750
 fourth position he takes for 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.610
 the moment on a plateau it in dual 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 alyzia date where the number two and on a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 third line can be seen next 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.439
 myrtle voltigeurs with her small 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
 red ears that extends this eighth 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.829
 previous position still the one who 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.800
 last year when it was 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.730
 it may be the wine day the number 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.530
 that a horse that had offered a 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.820
 formidable reply to the champion barely 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.980
 quick in 5 year critérium the horse 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.150
 is ideally placed in 4th position with 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.230
 Cedric Makers will no doubt be 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.700
 staggered in a few moments the 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.960
 soon the intersection of the tracks 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.550
 olive tree always with jean michel bazire 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.750

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.010
 duquesne at his hakim out of the cape 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.300
 green continues to put pressure 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.860
 while number bag in hand cases 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.320
 third position with a lot of 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.790
 resources just like him at the ball of 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.170
 number 15 which will not be long olivier is 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.100
 relaunched the young people who are at the three 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.120
 first places for now then 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.500
 that there is less than 500 meters left 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.700
 browse with astor duquenne the number 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.750

 leap in his wake to whoever 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.990

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.100
 publication around the fields also 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.090

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 number she is in fourth position 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.610
 now it's going to be played on a script 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.650
 with duval momentum that phase intensive to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.090
 the outside right from 150 meters to 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.810

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.930
 minute 10 that's what he did there I 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.489
 think you did that is what he did 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.930

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.910
 can not go out but good eric hours 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.170

 horse that is almost olive 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.710
 without fail since he had already won 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.060
 a test at the highest level at the beginning 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.110
 Winter criterium of 3 years is 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.150
 true he had a tailor-made course 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.310
 since he was brought to his companion 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.480
 box he was able to shift without too much 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.830
 problems fortunately that american raffin has 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.120
 could have shifted when the back of the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.470

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.300

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.770
 fifth place but he was very 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.180
 far away at the entrance of the brave night 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.540

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.120
 the tandem sébastien garat early eric 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.190
 refined it will be specified that it is particularly 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.480
 the tandem of roxane won every 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.850
 two this winter five groups a 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.170
 incredible more for the driver 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.580
 salesman you saw him he brought out 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.600
 only 50 meters from the post 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.310
 olive tree right now we will go 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.630
 collect the impressions so of 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.130
 the coach of this meeting with his 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:33.880
 Sebastian Guarato basilica lines then 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.320
 super super g is here 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.340
 but then he well has this criterion is the 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.500
 long course could not come out at the right 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.760
 moment and then that's it but it was not 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.600
 planned competition like that there is a 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.830
 clause team like that but today 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.690
 I had to change tactics and then 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.140
 here you have disappointed for your other 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.490
 pensionary 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.140
