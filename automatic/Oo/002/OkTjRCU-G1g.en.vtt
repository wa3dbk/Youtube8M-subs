00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.730
 new video we wanted you today 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 if my husband 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 a little bit more ahead 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.289
 and that is the sit and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 relax by hauck and only when you 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.930
 let's see why that's what it's called here 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.770
 is the normal seat, so to speak 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 we are now plugged every time 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.780
 to have 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.610
 and now I'll put that the second one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.680
 tower on it and that the relax essay 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 that is now this relax on sand 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.129
 That's why this high chair is already 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.890
 really from zero months suitable here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.429
 then you can do such a game 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.230
 then what do you do here 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.269
 A little bit below, the baby also grows something 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.879
 has to watch 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.010
 Here you have the to determine 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.860
 you also have the straps you can do that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.860
 Baby, so to speak, also in this one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.050
 carrying around the bowl that is here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 very soft so you want me too 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.070
 lay out more blankets and that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 material is the same as the seat 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.610
 tower so it is nice washable 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.259
 had the wind are not in it now 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
 more because he was too old for that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.969
 but our second child will come then 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 really banned holes in there you have 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.439
 It always looks and can do it too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.869
 have once dim in the kitchen with with 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.100
 That's why I actually was 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.960
 one with the reasons why i am looking for 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 decided this college because 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.759
 The part really really good 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.979
 by the way, that's the way it looks 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.859
 just do this completely normal and scaffold 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.079
 from where you then the two essays 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.630
 can do it then you just still 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.100
 times as a storage scorpio have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.450
 I then something like the washcloths in it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.840
 and the bibs and also a bit 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.189
 toys when the high chair moister 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.439
 it does not look folded 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.659
 then with us in the kitchen so out 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.670
 really super super space saving with so 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.140
 We do not have much space now 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 and we'll show you now 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 Step by step how to do the whole thing 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.550
 then disassemble and then disassemble 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.750
 what else is there for functions 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.280
 now you can also do so yet again, 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.260
 see from the side how narrow the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.849
 actually is very much so far 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.390
 takes up little space 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.840
 when it is folded and the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.340
 you just press on both sides 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.959
 you can lower the foot part then 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.930
 set up, so to speak 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.930
 it works, so to speak, to work apart 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.519
 then if there are the plans 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.380
 folded down then you have already there 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.310
 you can already see the quote knows well 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.870
 can be attached 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.400
 and now the picture just comes up 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.780
 On top of that you can stop off super 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.390
 that can be done a lot 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.489
 Cleanse better and you see 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.100
 real again the belts with which you 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.350
 then attach the child 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.380
 As I said the material can be great 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.390
 wipe wet if there is something 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.070
 is spilled or so occurred here too 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.079
 down if something falls down or 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.940
 so here on the table you have it again 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.250
 such a bulge here I put 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 most of the time the vial it the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.940
 fits her very well and everyone again 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.160
 a slightly larger bulge then for 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.010
 when it is so far and mugs and 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.079
 mug and something the back part you can 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.880
 of course also wonderful very far 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.650
 for example, child fold backwards 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.660
 take it or go that far 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.190
 above as we actually most 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.910
 have time because winter like a lot 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.620
 nice and just sitting and you can do that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.030
 whole part also very far after 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.760
 below we make that 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.560
 for example, if we sit high up 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.510
 over in the living room and the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.049
 put small with a living room table 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.390
 should 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.920
 and I think that's great too 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.859
 that you can do the real thing like that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.100
 height adjustable can change to green 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.720
 so that can really be done by 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.670
 the lake is so that he always with 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.100
 the adults can sit at the table 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 down here you can also see the foot part 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.480
 still unfold 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.510
 that sounds like that too 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.100
 fishermen down there so we 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.530
 he is very satisfied he is too 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.910
 very very sturdy and stable and it 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.859
 we like everything very rarely 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.990
 we'll show you how 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.710
 you assemble the whole thing again 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.600
 just take the table and we do 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.310
 We'll be down there in this 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.380
 storage head because it still 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.130
 space saving is then works 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.300
 Just raise the arms back up and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.460
 then press a page again and then 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.130
 it all comes together so nicely 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.050
 and then he gets so thin and small 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.400
 you can do that by showing then you can 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.169
 you can subordinate that too 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.330
 of course, even less space one 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.729
 this is our high chair from hau i 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.620
 Just link the chair again 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.180
 and in the infobox you can still 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.190
 times look at closely and one more time 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.660
 look for praise there are also 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.850
 different design that i have 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.990
 aware now here for this bear 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.910
 Design decided 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.860
 both can want to keep it neutral 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.449
 Of course there are blue and there are 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.610
 I think pink too 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.930
 I think there was something else, too 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.950
 Winnie the Pooh then in my 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.180
 tighter choice 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.220
 but I think that was not true 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.870
 available or so and then go again 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.060
 taken here because it's not that special 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.639
 on the boy or as open media 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.720
 wanted to have agreed 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.520
 write me my comments like 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.840
 you are what you are high 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.030
 maybe for a high chair 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.500
 Berlin and I'm happy 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.880
 me on your comments and we'll see 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.599
 See you soon at my next one 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.830
 Video 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.830
 bye bye
