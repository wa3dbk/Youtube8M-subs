that<00:00:18.800> was<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:18.950> difference<00:00:19.100> in<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.430> game<00:00:19.520> it

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
that was the difference in the game it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.570 
that was the difference in the game it
was<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.600> great<00:00:20.840> performance<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.410> feel<00:00:21.590> like<00:00:21.770> the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
was a great performance I feel like the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.680 
was a great performance I feel like the
whole<00:00:22.670> 90<00:00:22.910> minutes<00:00:23.830> worked<00:00:24.830> our<00:00:24.980> tails<00:00:25.160> off

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
whole 90 minutes worked our tails off

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.390 
whole 90 minutes worked our tails off
you<00:00:26.690> know<00:00:26.780> offensively<00:00:27.200> defensively<00:00:28.039> on

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400

transition<00:00:29.000> we<00:00:29.600> were<00:00:29.720> getting<00:00:29.930> in<00:00:30.020> behind

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
transition we were getting in behind

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.109 
transition we were getting in behind
them<00:00:30.530> I<00:00:30.800> think<00:00:31.220> we<00:00:31.310> were<00:00:31.430> just<00:00:31.610> a<00:00:31.730> handful<00:00:32.060> for

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
them I think we were just a handful for

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.600 
them I think we were just a handful for
him<00:00:32.419> throughout<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.320> whole<00:00:33.440> match<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:34.489> know

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
him throughout the whole match you know

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.300 
him throughout the whole match you know
it<00:00:34.790> was<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.940> nice<00:00:35.180> finish<00:00:35.540> by<00:00:35.750> Dawkins<00:00:36.530> but<00:00:37.280> uh

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
it was a nice finish by Dawkins but uh

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.550 
it was a nice finish by Dawkins but uh
you<00:00:38.149> know<00:00:38.270> I<00:00:38.480> feel<00:00:38.810> like<00:00:38.930> we<00:00:39.050> deserve<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.440> way

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
you know I feel like we deserve that way

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.190 
you know I feel like we deserve that way
very<00:00:40.160> good<00:00:40.310> win<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.880> very<00:00:41.540> good<00:00:41.720> start<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
very good win a very good start on the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.590 
very good win a very good start on the
game<00:00:42.380> I<00:00:42.800> think<00:00:43.520> we<00:00:43.700> came<00:00:43.910> out<00:00:43.970> extremely

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
game I think we came out extremely

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.850 
game I think we came out extremely
strong<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:47.020> dominated<00:00:48.020> completely<00:00:48.290> the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
strong and dominated completely the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.310 
strong and dominated completely the
first<00:00:49.100> 45<00:00:49.579> minutes<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:50.600> we<00:00:50.720> played<00:00:50.989> some<00:00:51.020> of

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
first 45 minutes think we played some of

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.650 
first 45 minutes think we played some of
the<00:00:51.500> best<00:00:51.980> server<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.399> far<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:52.760> season<00:00:52.820> in

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
the best server so far this season in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.220 
the best server so far this season in
the<00:00:53.840> first<00:00:54.079> 4<00:00:54.320> 45<00:00:54.860> minutes<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:55.570> came<00:00:56.570> out<00:00:56.719> with

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
the first 4 45 minutes I came out with

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.740 
the first 4 45 minutes I came out with
routed<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.920> nothing<00:00:58.309> lead<00:00:58.460> at<00:00:58.610> halftime<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.090> I

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
routed to nothing lead at halftime and I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.639 
routed to nothing lead at halftime and I
think<00:01:00.530> we<00:01:00.710> had<00:01:01.309> some<00:01:01.460> good<00:01:01.579> chances<00:01:01.640> in<00:01:02.649> second

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
think we had some good chances in second

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.879 
think we had some good chances in second
half<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.920> joy<00:01:04.189> to<00:01:04.429> kill<00:01:04.609> the<00:01:04.729> game

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:05.889 
half to joy to kill the game

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.379 
half to joy to kill the game
unfortunately<00:01:06.889> they<00:01:07.340> came<00:01:07.549> back<00:01:07.759> in<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.270> game

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:08.389 
unfortunately they came back in the game

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:11.440 
unfortunately they came back in the game
with<00:01:08.569> a<00:01:08.630> great<00:01:08.810> goal<00:01:09.130> but<00:01:10.130> figured<00:01:11.119> out<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.270> way

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
with a great goal but figured out a way

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.629 
with a great goal but figured out a way
to<00:01:11.509> to<00:01:12.139> keep<00:01:12.350> them<00:01:12.499> away<00:01:12.740> from<00:01:12.770> from<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.490> big

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
to to keep them away from from the big

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.160 
to to keep them away from from the big
changes<00:01:13.999> in<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.209> end<00:01:14.299> of<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.539> game<00:01:14.569> and<00:01:14.929> I

changes in the end of the game and I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.139 
changes in the end of the game and I
think<00:01:15.829> overall<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.340> was<00:01:16.459> a<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:16.579> solid

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
think overall it was a very solid

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.779 
think overall it was a very solid
performance<00:01:17.630> from<00:01:17.779> from<00:01:18.079> our<00:01:18.200> team<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:19.700> a

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789
