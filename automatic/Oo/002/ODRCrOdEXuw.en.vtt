00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.490 
plant beans with it started working with
a<00:00:27.310> mechanism<00:00:28.310> that<00:00:28.789> would<00:00:28.970> plant<00:00:29.359> this<00:00:30.140> one

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
a mechanism that would plant this one

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.689 
a mechanism that would plant this one
bean<00:00:31.279> seed<00:00:31.670> at<00:00:31.939> a<00:00:32.059> time<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.410> that's<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.160> brush

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
bean seed at a time and that's the brush

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.710

it's crazy as it might sound that brush
meter<00:01:01.039> caused<00:01:01.489> me<00:01:01.789> more<00:01:01.969> problem<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.680> the

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
meter caused me more problem then the

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.859 
meter caused me more problem then the
finger<00:01:04.250> pick<00:01:04.460> up<00:01:04.670> didn't<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.149> worked<00:01:05.420> on<00:01:05.660> that

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
finger pick up didn't I worked on that

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.570 
finger pick up didn't I worked on that
for<00:01:06.009> probably<00:01:07.009> three<00:01:07.640> or<00:01:07.670> four<00:01:07.759> years<00:01:09.430> went<00:01:10.430> up

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
for probably three or four years went up

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.150 
for probably three or four years went up
to<00:01:10.789> John<00:01:11.060> Deere<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:12.350> showed<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:12.979> them

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
to John Deere and I showed it to them

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.130 
to John Deere and I showed it to them
and<00:01:13.369> they<00:01:13.520> said<00:01:13.759> no<00:01:13.970> said<00:01:14.330> we're<00:01:14.570> coming<00:01:14.990> out

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140

and they said no said we're coming out
with<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:17.349> iron<00:01:18.349> meter<00:01:18.709> and<00:01:19.099> said<00:01:19.429> that's

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
with the iron meter and said that's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.580 
with the iron meter and said that's
gonna<00:01:19.880> solve<00:01:20.149> all<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.599> problems<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.410> so<00:01:21.619> Ivan

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
gonna solve all the problems and so Ivan

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.320 
gonna solve all the problems and so Ivan
destroyed<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.860> mean<00:01:25.069> I<00:01:25.099> didn't<00:01:25.550> even<00:01:25.610> keep<00:01:26.030> the
