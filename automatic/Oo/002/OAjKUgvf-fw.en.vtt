the<00:00:07.259> most<00:00:07.470> pitch<00:00:07.740> close<00:00:08.010> pretty<00:00:08.280> well<00:00:08.550> but<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the most pitch close pretty well but the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.370 
the most pitch close pretty well but the
swing<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.330> something<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.660> really<00:00:09.809> helped

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
swing was something that really helped

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.539 
swing was something that really helped
us<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> bowling<00:00:10.830> unit<00:00:10.980> today<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:13.549> that

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
us as a bowling unit today and that

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.599 
us as a bowling unit today and that
finding<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.059> fuller<00:00:15.389> length<00:00:15.540> obviously

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
finding that fuller length obviously

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.099 
finding that fuller length obviously
showed<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.210> Knicks<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.690> bolds<00:00:18.960> can

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
showed that the Knicks and bolds can

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.689 
showed that the Knicks and bolds can
come<00:00:19.289> from<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.470> length<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> will<00:00:20.670> give

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
come from that length so that will give

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
come from that length so that will give
me<00:00:20.880> confidence<00:00:21.119> leading<00:00:21.720> into<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.380> rest<00:00:22.529> of

me confidence leading into the rest of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.580 
me confidence leading into the rest of
this<00:00:22.740> series<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:24.170> i'll<00:00:25.170> certainly<00:00:25.500> be

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this series and i'll certainly be

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
this series and i'll certainly be
searching<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.880> length<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.840> the

searching for a length with with the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
searching for a length with with the
quick<00:00:28.800> bouncer<00:00:29.160> obviously<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> player<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
quick bouncer obviously is a player you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999 
quick bouncer obviously is a player you
get<00:00:30.750> asked<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.500> roles<00:00:31.710> within

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
get asked to do different roles within

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.209 
get asked to do different roles within
the<00:00:32.189> side<00:00:32.399> i<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:33.710> within<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> change<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the side i think within the change of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
the side i think within the change of
everyone's<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.450> always<00:00:36.719> known<00:00:36.899> i'm

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
everyone's or it not always known i'm

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.889 
everyone's or it not always known i'm
best<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> pitch<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> ball<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.870> get<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
best when I pitch the ball up get a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.030 
best when I pitch the ball up get a
little<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.260> movement<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> when<00:00:43.040> when

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
little bit of movement but when when

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.180 
little bit of movement but when when
that<00:00:44.219> moment<00:00:44.399> comes<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.890> bowlers<00:00:46.890> needed

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that moment comes where a bowlers needed

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
that moment comes where a bowlers needed
too<00:00:47.280> rough<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> batsman<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.090> poor<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.620> get<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
too rough a batsman are poor or get to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
too rough a batsman are poor or get to
em<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> hook<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> try<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.660> sell<00:00:51.960> some

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
em out on the hook and try and sell some

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
em out on the hook and try and sell some
on<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.590> ball<00:00:52.800> gets<00:00:52.860> thrown<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> me

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
on then the ball gets thrown to me

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
on then the ball gets thrown to me
because<00:00:54.559> my<00:00:55.559> bat<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.719> pretty<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
because my bat is pretty good and it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.279 
because my bat is pretty good and it's
got<00:00:58.320> decent<00:00:58.500> yard<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.989> will

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
got decent yard in it so I think we will

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.950 
got decent yard in it so I think we will
have<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> changing<00:01:02.190> room<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
have it in the changing room that the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
have it in the changing room that the
way<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> bail<00:01:04.379> today<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.860> certainly<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
way I bail today is certainly the way to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
way I bail today is certainly the way to
go<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> order<00:01:07.979> refa

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
go but if if we need to order refa

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
go but if if we need to order refa

let me show you fantastic patient's I
think<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.480> bill<00:01:45.630> swim<00:01:45.870> for<00:01:46.110> has<00:01:46.230> all<00:01:46.320> day<00:01:46.530> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
think the bill swim for has all day so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.690 
think the bill swim for has all day so
the<00:01:47.670> way<00:01:47.820> he<00:01:48.120> he<00:01:48.900> left<00:01:49.140> outside<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.980> stampers

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the way he he left outside of stampers

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.820 
the way he he left outside of stampers
was<00:01:51.390> probably<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.750> particular<00:01:52.020> highlight<00:01:52.320> form

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
was probably a particular highlight form

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.510 
was probably a particular highlight form
and<00:01:53.510> but<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.440> we're<00:01:55.920> both<00:01:56.010> quite<00:01:56.310> nicely

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and but I think we're both quite nicely

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
and but I think we're both quite nicely
atomy<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.330> kept<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> pressure<00:01:58.050> at<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.650> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
atomy we kept the pressure at all the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
atomy we kept the pressure at all the
time<00:01:59.190> we<00:01:59.520> try<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> give<00:02:00.570> him<00:02:00.660> any<00:02:00.750> easy

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
time we try not to give him any easy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.950 
time we try not to give him any easy
easy<00:02:01.320> boundaries<00:02:02.660> so<00:02:03.660> we<00:02:03.750> played

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
easy boundaries so we played

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.250 
easy boundaries so we played
particularly<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:04.410> 300<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.990> said<00:02:07.140> we

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
particularly well 300 but as I said we

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.810 
particularly well 300 but as I said we
look<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.800> our<00:02:07.860> plans<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.580> we

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
look at our plans to and I think we

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.690 
look at our plans to and I think we
executed<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.479> quite<00:02:09.720> nicely<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.490> Barry

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
executed them quite nicely but it Barry

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.910 
executed them quite nicely but it Barry
