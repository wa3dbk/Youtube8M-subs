to this type of performance with the new
macbook<00:05:13.310> pro<00:05:13.640> we<00:05:14.420> set<00:05:14.810> out<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.380> design

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
macbook pro we set out to design

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.920 
macbook pro we set out to design
something<00:05:16.340> extreme

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
something extreme

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.890 
something extreme
and<00:05:18.560> this<00:05:18.860> led<00:05:19.190> us<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.610> rethink<00:05:20.389> everything

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
and this led us to rethink everything

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.379 
and this led us to rethink everything
about<00:05:21.500> our<00:05:21.680> process<00:05:22.060> everything<00:05:23.060> about

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
about our process everything about

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.519 
about our process everything about
what's<00:05:23.600> essential<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.620> notebook

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
what's essential to a notebook

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.979 
what's essential to a notebook
and<00:05:26.799> that<00:05:27.159> meant<00:05:27.489> that<00:05:28.149> we<00:05:28.269> could<00:05:28.299> design<00:05:28.779> the

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:28.989 
and that meant that we could design the

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:31.979 
and that meant that we could design the
very<00:05:29.319> best<00:05:29.679> computer<00:05:30.219> for<00:05:30.399> today<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:31.089> for<00:05:31.959> the

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:31.989 
very best computer for today and for the

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:34.079 
very best computer for today and for the
future
