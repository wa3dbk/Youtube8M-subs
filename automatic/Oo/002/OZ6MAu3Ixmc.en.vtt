00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.020
 well we are here with the charger is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.720
 66 05 street 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.710
 we wanted to teach him how to use it to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.710
 load a relief 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.780
 good the cable that comes in the charger 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.110
 It is of this type 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.210
 and connect it here is encoded by 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.780
 color the black in the black the red in the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 Red 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.360
 we have here a stack of 5000 thousand amperes 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.050
 Two cells 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.000
 which we will connect 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.750
 a main plug 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.970
 and the connector to balance is 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.970
 connect in the port for laser 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.790
 I recommend you always use a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.580
 bag for loads of olive tree so that the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.970
 Charge the batteries safely 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 clean are highly flammable so 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 that are not used 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.720
 wants to take care of his own and his wrote that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.720
 nothing happens to him 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.820
 let's leave there 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 now when we get here the charger 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 let's 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.080
 you have to go to the main menu that rotates 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.850
 with these two buttons 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.850
 for both for both sides 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
 you have to look for the one where you say lipo but 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.770
 We were the bat team 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.350
 we press enter we want 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.560
 always charge a lipo that is over 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.530
 of two cells of two cells or more in 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.049
 way to balance 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.830
 then with this one moves to ice 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.740
 different way of loading or unloading us 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.200
 let's go to lipo bullets 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.420
 the pile that we are charging is 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.600
 5000 thousand amperes so the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.360
 we will charge to 5 pÃ©rez if out of 4000 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.540
 thousand amps we would have to charge 4 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.210
 so, but we are still without perez 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.280
 it is put to the battery voltage or in 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:35.050
 defect the amount of cell in this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.270
 case is two cells or 7.4 vol 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.270
 we left the enter button 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.940
 and will verify that everything is fine 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.470
 connected and here we have to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.120
 confirm 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.400
 the battery and it is already loading in the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.640
 bottom right side shows us 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.320
 how many milian pÃ©rez has loaded 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.620
 so that if the stack was up to the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.810
 half of its discharge in this case to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.660
 finish the load would reach 2500 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.440
 milliamps work 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.700
 here tells us the time it takes 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 loading and here indicates the amps to 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.720
 which is loading if we want to see 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.940
 how it is in our pile in the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.130
 two cells the voltage they have we can 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.020
 select with the button more and we 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.810
 will show here the individual voltages 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.850
 for each cell in this case the stack is 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.190
 find perfectly balanced 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.860
 because there is a very small difference 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.580
 between the two cells which at the end of 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.300
 the load that should reach 42 by 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.300
 each cell 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.090
 now let's proceed to load a stack 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.720
 nickel metal in this case of 3300 thousand 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.620
 72 volt metal nickel metal in this 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.230
 case we have occupied this cable razer 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.349
 fact that comes with all the different 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.370
 connectors with 10 stretcher to load 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.650
 receiver batteries 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:15.970
 so here you go back to the main menu 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.100
 goes to nickel metal select program 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.930
 the crack between 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.490
 we no longer have the function of balancing 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.770
 like the lipo yes that there is only 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.750
 enter it how much am but do not want 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.150
 load 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.540
 and that's enough in this case 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.540
 let's connect 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.960
 and we left the start button 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.880
 enter the stack and you are already 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.210
 loading taking into consideration that the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.650
 batteries or that the metal chargers to 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.000
 Sometimes they do not detect when they are 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.610
 fully loaded so 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.830
 we recommend touching the batteries 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.210
 so that they are warm at the moment of 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.610
 finalize the load in case of not being 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.980
 warm you have to put the load again 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.220
 until the pile takes some 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.220
 temperature
