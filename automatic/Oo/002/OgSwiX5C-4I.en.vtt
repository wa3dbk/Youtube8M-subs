00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 and next to blue is very close 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.420
 there is such a popular color to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.480
 blue color is a color that refreshes color 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.570
 which a lot of people rejuvenate and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.789
 grandfather who is in our in our region in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 our country so many people and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 fit because it is the color which 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 corresponds to the type of summer and all women 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.189
 and most of them he fits but 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.399
 after all this is a very difficult color than he 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.460
 associated with many head spelled 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.649
 in big letters the word hope yes because 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.180
 that blue is the color of hope 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 why is this color hope for example why 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.629
 on the same cube the light of hope is not blue 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 pink everything is actually very simple 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.760
 when a person prays where he looks and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 looks at the sky from the mean at what 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 blue or another question and give a person 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.619
 waiting for help wine something really hopes 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 where he looks at looking into the distance 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 when will some help come and if 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 my in our latitudes will look into the distance 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 what we will see there is a bluish haze 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 well, so it is very clear and logical 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 why do we have this color correlates 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 it is with the color of hope on the cube on the cube 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 pink because she is just red 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 the soil and accordingly this haze in the distance 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.079
 it will be pink 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.619
 just but on this we can very much 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.590
 play and so girl in blue what is it 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 such an image well, probably something 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.409
 a little bit more serious than a girl in pink 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.500
 but also 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 also this creature from life is not real 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 it's a creature soaring in the clouds 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 being unwilling to recognize and see 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.619
 reality is what it is but it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.369
 no longer an infantile creature as if 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.159
 hysterical and this will be a girl who 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.840
 lives on some very clear principles 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.640
 and go 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.830
 and it is important that everything is correct and such 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.040
 girls will mostly choose 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.160
 blue color but if we are talking about 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.680
 choice in clothes what 's in the interior 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.549
 bungie conducted more than once research and 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.040
 stated an amazing fact if we 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.530
 go to the room 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.750
 which is in part 1 you even on 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.569
 one side let room 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.970
 painted walls are yellow orange and 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.209
 next room windows are facing the same 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.370
 the side is painted blue and how 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.079
 you think it will turn out that in 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.480
 the room where the walls are beautiful 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.730
 blue painted temperature 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.060
 about 2 degrees below Celsius 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.640
 it shows the edge of the thermometer than in that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.819
 the room is in the same side 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.430
 lights but walls to be painted in 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.590
 warm yellow intense shade it 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.140
 once again proves that these vibrations 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.629
 which are color vibrations around us 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.870
 there is no reason that they are not us 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.030
 acts maybe we don't understand it and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.200
 we do not feel but we are alive with them 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.519
 every day blue is very good at 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.760
 actually the ladies who decided very 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.579
 seriously lose weight 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.970
 quickly go to the kitchen and repaint 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.109
 all blue color blue color kills 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.680
 our appetite 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.560
 yes because it is cold and we love 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.930
 I have a cold meal I love more 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.650
 there is glass so the action is very 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.859
 simple cold tableware 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.840
 tablecloth cold color curtains and us 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.010
 a little easier to cope with nothing 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.010
 can handle for years
