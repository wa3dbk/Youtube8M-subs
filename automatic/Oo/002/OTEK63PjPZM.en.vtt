ever but take one look at this one and I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
ever but take one look at this one and I
think<00:00:43.320> you'll<00:00:43.410> agree<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.280> big<00:00:44.460> issue

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
think you'll agree with me the big issue

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.130 
think you'll agree with me the big issue
here<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> Macintosh<00:00:45.840> portable

now<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> course<00:00:53.489> inside<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.390> actually

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
now of course inside it was actually

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.049 
now of course inside it was actually
fairly<00:00:54.989> decent<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> time<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.160> has<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> 16

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

megabyte of RAM however all that didn't

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
megabyte of RAM however all that didn't
help<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:01.859> being<00:01:02.129> absolutely<00:01:03.090> massive<00:01:03.390> as

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
help it from being absolutely massive as

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
help it from being absolutely massive as
it<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.260> basically<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> normal<00:01:04.920> Mac<00:01:05.220> from<00:01:05.430> the

form factor another major problem is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
form factor another major problem is
that<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.740> powered<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.189> lead<00:01:11.520> acid<00:01:11.700> battery

that it's powered by a lead acid battery

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
that it's powered by a lead acid battery
the<00:01:12.420> same<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> battery<00:01:13.049> you'll<00:01:13.170> find<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the same kind of battery you'll find in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
the same kind of battery you'll find in
your<00:01:13.530> car<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.580> didn't<00:01:14.790> work<00:01:14.909> too<00:01:15.090> well

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
your car now this didn't work too well

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
your car now this didn't work too well
for<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.420> laptop<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> ever<00:01:16.409> actually

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
for a laptop is if you ever actually

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.590 
for a laptop is if you ever actually
depleted<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> battery<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> 0%

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
depleted the battery to 0%

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
depleted the battery to 0%
it<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.110> totally<00:01:19.590> dead<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> even

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it was totally dead to make it even

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
it was totally dead to make it even
worse<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> tried<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.600> plug<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> use

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
worse if you tried to plug it in and use

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
worse if you tried to plug it in and use
it<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> AC<00:01:23.070> adapter<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.820> wasn't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it just off the AC adapter it wasn't

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
it just off the AC adapter it wasn't
powerful<00:01:24.390> enough<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> then

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
powerful enough to actually run the then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
powerful enough to actually run the then
pretty<00:01:26.310> powerful<00:01:26.729> hardware<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> couple<00:01:28.020> all

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pretty powerful hardware so a couple all

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830 
pretty powerful hardware so a couple all
this<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> giant<00:01:29.100> $6,500<00:01:30.030> price<00:01:30.299> tag<00:01:30.600> and

the<00:01:31.259> Mac<00:01:31.470> portable<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.369> wasn't<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the Mac portable really wasn't so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
the Mac portable really wasn't so
portable<00:01:33.240> after<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:34.170> number<00:01:34.439> four<00:01:34.680> we

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
portable after all at number four we

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
portable after all at number four we
have<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> IBM<00:01:35.700> ThinkPad<00:01:36.240> trans<00:01:36.659> note<00:01:36.900> from

have the IBM ThinkPad trans note from

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.350 
have the IBM ThinkPad trans note from
2001<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> big<00:01:38.640> problem<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.119> one

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
2001 now the big problem with this one

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.640 
2001 now the big problem with this one
was<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.380> ahead<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
was actually that it was way ahead of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
was actually that it was way ahead of
its<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.210> hand<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.840> was

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
its time so on one hand you had what was

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
its time so on one hand you had what was
basically<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.380> normal<00:01:43.770> laptop<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.490> had<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
basically a normal laptop so you had a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
basically a normal laptop so you had a
Pentium<00:01:45.119> 3<00:01:45.149> processor<00:01:45.840> windows<00:01:46.320> 98<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Pentium 3 processor windows 98 and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
Pentium 3 processor windows 98 and
actually<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> fairly<00:01:47.729> impressive<00:01:48.030> 10.4<00:01:48.899> inch

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
actually a fairly impressive 10.4 inch

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
actually a fairly impressive 10.4 inch
touchscreen<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> ran<00:01:50.189> into<00:01:50.340> issues<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
touchscreen where I ran into issues is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.130 
touchscreen where I ran into issues is
the<00:01:51.119> pin<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.659> wasn't<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the pin really wasn't all that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
the pin really wasn't all that
comfortable<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> use<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.369> much<00:01:53.549> larger

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
comfortable to use as it was much larger

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
comfortable to use as it was much larger
than<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.119> normal<00:01:54.420> sized<00:01:54.570> pin<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.500> top<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
than a normal sized pin and on top of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
than a normal sized pin and on top of
that<00:01:55.950> when<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> ran<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.579> ink<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that when you ran out of ink you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.459 
that when you ran out of ink you
actually<00:01:57.299> had<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> buy<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> ink<00:01:58.049> cartridges

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
actually had to buy the ink cartridges

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.039 
actually had to buy the ink cartridges
straight<00:01:58.860> from<00:01:59.040> IBM<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.939> top<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
straight from IBM on top of that the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.929 
straight from IBM on top of that the
entire<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.680> absolutely<00:02:02.340> massive<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
entire thing was absolutely massive and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
entire thing was absolutely massive and
with<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> $3,000<00:02:03.689> price<00:02:03.840> tag<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.350> didn't<00:02:04.560> last

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
with a $3,000 price tag it didn't last

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
with a $3,000 price tag it didn't last
too<00:02:04.890> long<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.520> number<00:02:05.880> three<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.360> had<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> Sony

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
too long at number three we had the Sony

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.559 
too long at number three we had the Sony
Vaio<00:02:06.960> P<00:02:07.439> from<00:02:07.619> 2009<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.209> back<00:02:09.360> when

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
Vaio P from 2009 now this was back when

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
Vaio P from 2009 now this was back when
netbooks<00:02:09.869> were<00:02:09.989> really<00:02:10.229> big<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> imagine

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
netbooks were really big so I imagine

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.949 
netbooks were really big so I imagine
Sony<00:02:11.459> engineers<00:02:11.849> said<00:02:12.060> hey<00:02:12.270> look<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.840> do

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
Sony engineers said hey look we can do

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.300 
Sony engineers said hey look we can do
way

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
way

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.370 
way
better<00:02:13.430> than<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.060> by<00:02:14.510> better<00:02:14.690> they

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
better than that and by better they

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.229 
better than that and by better they
meant<00:02:15.590> way<00:02:15.770> smaller<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.730> screen<00:02:16.970> itself

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
meant way smaller the screen itself

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.210 
meant way smaller the screen itself
wasn't<00:02:17.599> bad<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.200> an<00:02:18.290> 8<00:02:18.440> inch<00:02:18.620> display<00:02:18.980> with

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
wasn't bad it was an 8 inch display with

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.670 
wasn't bad it was an 8 inch display with
a<00:02:19.250> resolution<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.819> 1600<00:02:20.599> by<00:02:20.690> 768<00:02:21.080> which

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
a resolution of 1600 by 768 which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.380 
a resolution of 1600 by 768 which
actually<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> better<00:02:22.400> than<00:02:22.670> some<00:02:22.880> 7<00:02:23.209> inch<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
actually is better than some 7 inch and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.540 
actually is better than some 7 inch and
8<00:02:23.569> inch<00:02:23.599> tablets<00:02:24.170> today<00:02:24.440> however<00:02:25.160> where<00:02:25.459> it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
8 inch tablets today however where it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.979 
8 inch tablets today however where it
came<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:25.849> problems<00:02:26.270> was<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.569> fact<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
came into problems was the fact that the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.690 
came into problems was the fact that the
Intel<00:02:27.349> Atom<00:02:27.530> processor<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.250> was<00:02:28.340> powering

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
Intel Atom processor that was powering

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.670 
Intel Atom processor that was powering
it<00:02:28.819> was<00:02:29.239> way<00:02:29.510> too<00:02:29.540> weak<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> actually<00:02:30.380> handle

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it was way too weak to actually handle

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.559 
it was way too weak to actually handle
that<00:02:30.860> resolution<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:32.000> top<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.330> that

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
that resolution and on top of that that

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.360 
that resolution and on top of that that
resolution<00:02:32.870> was<00:02:33.140> really<00:02:33.650> really<00:02:33.860> small<00:02:34.130> with

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
resolution was really really small with

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.880 
resolution was really really small with
Windows<00:02:34.730> XP<00:02:34.910> on<00:02:35.360> an<00:02:35.540> 8<00:02:35.750> inch<00:02:35.900> display<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.709> was

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
Windows XP on an 8 inch display it was

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.259 
Windows XP on an 8 inch display it was
very<00:02:37.099> hard<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.370> see<00:02:37.519> much<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.760> anything<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
very hard to see much of anything that

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.030 
very hard to see much of anything that
you<00:02:38.390> were<00:02:38.480> doing<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:39.140> top<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.860> had<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you were doing on top of that it had a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.009 
you were doing on top of that it had a
tiny<00:02:40.489> little<00:02:40.910> keyboard<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.510> absolutely<00:02:41.810> no

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
tiny little keyboard and absolutely no

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.720 
tiny little keyboard and absolutely no
trackpad<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.560> touchscreen<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.459> all<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
trackpad or touchscreen so all the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.040 
trackpad or touchscreen so all the
navigation<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.300> did<00:02:44.480> was<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> little

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
navigation you did was with a little

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.410 
navigation you did was with a little
tiny<00:02:45.319> nub<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.830> middle<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> keyboard

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
tiny nub in the middle of the keyboard

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.850 
tiny nub in the middle of the keyboard
combine<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.720> 900<00:02:48.200> Allah<00:02:48.290> price<00:02:48.560> and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
combine this with a 900 Allah price and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.410 
combine this with a 900 Allah price and
it<00:02:48.980> didn't<00:02:49.220> last<00:02:49.340> too<00:02:49.519> long<00:02:49.549> although<00:02:50.030> funnily

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
it didn't last too long although funnily

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.910 
it didn't last too long although funnily
enough<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:50.989> actually<00:02:51.140> still<00:02:51.590> find<00:02:51.769> them

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
enough you can actually still find them

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.039 
enough you can actually still find them

was actually a great idea and again

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.289 
was actually a great idea and again
something<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.700> was<00:02:58.849> ahead<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> its<00:02:59.239> time

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
something that was ahead of its time

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.210 
something that was ahead of its time
basically<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.410> was<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.890> various

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
basically this was one of the various

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220 
basically this was one of the various
first<00:03:01.489> Ultra<00:03:01.940> portables<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.080> course

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
first Ultra portables now of course

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.660 
first Ultra portables now of course
taking<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> look<00:03:03.709> at<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:03.920> today<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.430> really

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
taking a look at it today it really

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.309 
taking a look at it today it really
wasn't<00:03:04.819> all<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.090> ultra<00:03:05.540> portable<00:03:05.780> but

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
wasn't all that ultra portable but

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.509 
wasn't all that ultra portable but
compared<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.709> laptops<00:03:07.099> of<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.280> time

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
compared to laptops of the time

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.039 
compared to laptops of the time
especially<00:03:07.849> like<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.330> Macintosh<00:03:08.780> portable

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
especially like the Macintosh portable

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.050 
especially like the Macintosh portable
it<00:03:09.470> was<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.920> lot<00:03:10.130> smaller<00:03:10.459> when<00:03:10.940> it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
it was actually a lot smaller when it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.370 
it was actually a lot smaller when it
ran<00:03:11.209> into<00:03:11.330> problems<00:03:11.510> was<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.959> fact<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.260> it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
ran into problems was the fact that it

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.380 
ran into problems was the fact that it
relies<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:12.709> two<00:03:13.130> inch<00:03:13.280> floppy<00:03:13.580> disks<00:03:14.000> now<00:03:14.330> if

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
relies on two inch floppy disks now if

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.490 
relies on two inch floppy disks now if
you<00:03:14.480> never<00:03:14.630> heard<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> these<00:03:15.019> before<00:03:15.290> there's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
you never heard of these before there's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.990 
you never heard of these before there's
a<00:03:15.530> good<00:03:15.680> reason<00:03:15.709> they<00:03:16.130> absolutely<00:03:16.489> flopped

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
a good reason they absolutely flopped

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.810 
a good reason they absolutely flopped
and<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.390> costing<00:03:17.810> over<00:03:17.930> $8<00:03:18.530> per<00:03:18.590> floppy<00:03:19.190> was

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
and it costing over $8 per floppy was

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.400 
and it costing over $8 per floppy was
way<00:03:20.090> way<00:03:20.329> too<00:03:20.390> much<00:03:20.570> money<00:03:20.840> for<00:03:20.959> people<00:03:21.320> to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
way way too much money for people to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.170 
way way too much money for people to
spend<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.340> because<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.030> was<00:03:23.120> very

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
spend so because of this it was very

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.970 
spend so because of this it was very
difficult<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.750> get<00:03:23.840> any<00:03:24.019> kind<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.380> programs<00:03:24.829> or

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
difficult to get any kind of programs or

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.440 
difficult to get any kind of programs or
in<00:03:25.070> fact<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.430> whole<00:03:25.700> lot<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:25.910> anything<00:03:26.329> on

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
in fact do a whole lot of anything on

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.970 
in fact do a whole lot of anything on
this<00:03:26.600> laptop<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.290> operating<00:03:27.650> system<00:03:27.890> was

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
this laptop the operating system was

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.620 
this laptop the operating system was
also<00:03:28.280> saved<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> ram<00:03:28.910> disk<00:03:29.120> which<00:03:29.420> meant

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
also saved on a ram disk which meant

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.000 
also saved on a ram disk which meant
that<00:03:29.690> if<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.930> battery<00:03:30.079> ever<00:03:30.410> went<00:03:30.650> out<00:03:30.739> you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
that if the battery ever went out you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.559 
that if the battery ever went out you
had<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> go<00:03:31.280> into<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.519> BIOS<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.060> reset<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.390> up

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
had to go into the BIOS and reset it up

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.840 
had to go into the BIOS and reset it up
to<00:03:32.690> be<00:03:32.780> even<00:03:32.930> able<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.290> boot<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.709> computer
