but it's quite difficult if you I mean
so<00:00:10.160> simple<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.340> learn<00:00:11.550> how<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:13.110> it's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
so simple to learn how to do it but it's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:01:10.990 
so simple to learn how to do it but it's
hard<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> actually<00:00:13.559> do

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.270 

okay<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:11.720> listen<00:01:11.840> young<00:01:12.440> fix<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.190> you're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
not using in the 10 then you could spit

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.170 
not using in the 10 then you could spit
sprinklers<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.560> we've<00:01:19.550> roll<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.000> onto

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
didn't catch there but you know okay so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.330 
didn't catch there but you know okay so
when<00:01:38.150> you're<00:01:38.240> actually<00:01:38.330> doing<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.840> whip<00:01:39.340> what

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
when you're actually doing the whip what

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.820 
when you're actually doing the whip what
you<00:01:40.430> want<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.640> do<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:42.110> will<00:01:42.200> not<00:01:42.320> probably<00:01:42.560> want

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you want to do so will not probably want

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.070 
you want to do so will not probably want
to<00:01:42.860> hold<00:01:43.009> your<00:01:43.160> sticks<00:01:43.340> like<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:44.780> there

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
to hold your sticks like that in there

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.600 
to hold your sticks like that in there
so<00:01:45.259> they're<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.440> bit<00:01:45.470> far<00:01:45.830> apart<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.340> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
so they're a bit far apart so you can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.870 
so they're a bit far apart so you can
get<00:01:47.270> around<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.050> diabolo<00:01:48.410> there<00:01:48.710> guess<00:01:49.700> that

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
get around the diabolo there guess that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.160 
get around the diabolo there guess that
works<00:01:51.610> your<00:01:52.610> list<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.270> want<00:01:53.420> your<00:01:53.600> stick<00:01:53.960> on

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
works your list you want your stick on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.499 
works your list you want your stick on
the<00:01:54.440> inside<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:55.820> close<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.149> you
