00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
of the day sure maybe all I did was

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.440 
of the day sure maybe all I did was
calibrate<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> sensor<00:05:37.910> used<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.240> test

that<00:05:42.890> tested<00:05:43.460> those<00:05:43.670> components<00:05:44.570> because

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
that tested those components because

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.470 
that tested those components because
