00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.820
 good afternoon we go to the team 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:10.880
 called scholastics which make it up 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.860
 my colleagues roxana vargas fallas the 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 antioqueña caves garcía 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.830
 irma bocanegra pérez ind and tells me 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 figueroa palaces gestos gómez areas and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.410
 I 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.730
 jamie vergara greetings 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.630
 we have been doing a project 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.270
 ecological called offside which is to use 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.120
 things that we do not use since it is a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.450
 waste to form new things but 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.700
 one of the products that is is from 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.100
 old notebooks already used 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.620
 previously in previous courses that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 they do not know about five days ago 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.190
 notebook or two at least this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.950
 we advise and all these hours we grab 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 the similar ones and we form a new one 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.760
 package new destiny to your 50 like here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.949
 this one of cut iras that remain in the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.989
 We also use the springs 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.720
 more good covers that are for example 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.690
 we patch them and the corners 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.390
 are damaged or something and this and and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.460
 we occupy for the notebooks and the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.010
 procedure is the following one time 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.970
 leafless and having the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.880
 leaves and doors 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.710
 and if we grab the spring we start 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.710
 insert part by part of the area 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 the objective of 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.460
 of what we are doing is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 reuse the leaves that we already have and do not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.620
 of not discarding the simply burning 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.100
 damaging the environment 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.320
 throw it in the trash since for example 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.330
 too many millions of trees are cut 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.330
 to form these diverse 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.130
 but 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.720
 If we do this, everyone in his house does not 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.420
 they reuse the freedom that they 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 left over 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.070
 we put this 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.580
 will help up to 17 trees per year also 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.910
 as 30% of the energy in all of Mexico is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.740
 used to make the notebooks and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.560
 if we do this that I am 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.440
 doing and this we can use to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.950
 something else and also as I mentioned in 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.410
 the trees 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.090
 Another of our objectives is that 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.470
 example these areas already just do not 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.709
 we are going to occupy them and throw them to the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.200
 trash and we can create a new one already 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.500
 economists to start for example already 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.680
 you will not have to buy more notebooks and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.080
 neither damage to the environment 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.590
 well here with we continue with the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.590
 process 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.370
 the other section is the end 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.920
 and nothing more 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.920
 the last 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.840
 as you can see it's not very difficult to 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.340
 do what 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.610
 but they have been trying every packet of 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.330
 leaves 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.330
 spring 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.510
 already have all the leaves inserted 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.050
 we grab the top part of the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.050
 notebook 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.590
 and finally the back goes 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.390
 Once inserted both are marked 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.390
 close each one 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.660
 already have the list we have a product 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.600
 like this one 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.600
 a freedom totally recycled all 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.230
 since we had good we also have 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.230
 others as they are 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.620
 this can not be given accounts mend 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.620
 some short of others 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.310
 some are totally nothing like that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.310
 is 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.830
 the conclusion to this also another part 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.330
 that looked at all those that no longer occupy 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 for example enough is already scratched 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.830
 we use them for 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.960
 It is the signal 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.160
 and here we have 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.039
 what are the cards 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.419
 good the condition was fine 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.470
 recycle the leaves that we no longer use 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.520
 because as I mentioned 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.920
 You can go back to 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.980
 use 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.390
 and we can also help 17 trees by 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.930
 year ago 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.930
 Hello
