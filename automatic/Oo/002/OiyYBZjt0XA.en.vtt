00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
show you guys and basically look at the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.700 
show you guys and basically look at the
badge<00:01:18.310> look<00:01:18.850> at<00:01:19.000> his<00:01:19.149> badge<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:20.079> is<00:01:20.289> not<00:01:20.469> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
badge look at his badge that is not the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.389 
badge look at his badge that is not the
warden<00:01:21.039> it's<00:01:21.280> just<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.939> just<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.420> boss<00:01:23.399> guard

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
warden it's just it's just a boss guard

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.359 
warden it's just it's just a boss guard
zombie<00:01:24.939> so<00:01:25.420> maybe<00:01:26.259> it's<00:01:26.560> like<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.920> head<00:01:27.100> guard

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
zombie so maybe it's like the head guard

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.240 
zombie so maybe it's like the head guard
or<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.640> lead<00:01:27.850> guard<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.270> Alcatraz<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:29.500> don't

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
or the lead guard of Alcatraz I don't

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.149 
or the lead guard of Alcatraz I don't
think<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.670> warden<00:01:30.939> would<00:01:31.390> have<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:32.079> badge<00:01:32.770> that

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
think the warden would have a badge that

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.690 
think the warden would have a badge that
says<00:01:33.539> Alcatraz<00:01:34.539> guard<00:01:34.959> if<00:01:35.920> he's<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.429> warden

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
says Alcatraz guard if he's the warden

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.089 
says Alcatraz guard if he's the warden
so<00:01:37.420> definitely<00:01:37.780> definitely<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.950> boss

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
so definitely definitely the the boss

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.889 
so definitely definitely the the boss
zombie<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.670> not<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.119> warden<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.630> just

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
zombie is not the warden it's just

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.919 
zombie is not the warden it's just
another<00:01:41.200> Alcatraz<00:01:41.829> guard<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.659> we're<00:01:43.659> still

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
another Alcatraz guard and we're still

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.289 
another Alcatraz guard and we're still
thinking<00:01:43.959> that<00:01:44.770> his<00:01:44.979> name<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.520> Brutus<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:46.270> I

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
