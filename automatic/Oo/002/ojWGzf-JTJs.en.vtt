camera<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> panis<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
camera and panis is really going up to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.310 
camera and panis is really going up to
that<00:00:24.090> retro<00:00:24.510> look<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.840> feel<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.170> this

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that retro look and feel with this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
that retro look and feel with this
product<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:26.519> example<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.330> main<00:00:27.510> dial<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
product for example the main dial on the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
product for example the main dial on the
top<00:00:28.109> doesn't<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.949> exposure<00:00:29.460> mode<00:00:29.760> it's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
top doesn't have just exposure mode it's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.659 
top doesn't have just exposure mode it's
therefore<00:00:30.660> shutter<00:00:31.019> speed<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
therefore shutter speed and there's a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
therefore shutter speed and there's a
ring<00:00:32.850> around<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.300> lens<00:00:33.330> barrel<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:34.170> used

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
ring around the lens barrel that's used

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.950 
ring around the lens barrel that's used
to<00:00:34.530> adjust<00:00:34.799> the<00:00:34.920> aperture<00:00:35.540> now<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.720> is<00:00:36.839> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to adjust the aperture now this is the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
to adjust the aperture now this is the
way<00:00:37.049> that<00:00:37.229> all<00:00:37.290> older<00:00:37.890> film<00:00:38.070> cameras<00:00:38.460> used<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
way that all older film cameras used to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
way that all older film cameras used to
work<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.839> there's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> very<00:00:40.080> good<00:00:40.170> reason<00:00:40.320> for

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
work and there's a very good reason for

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
work and there's a very good reason for
implementing<00:00:41.220> these<00:00:41.370> analog<00:00:41.790> controls<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.479> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
implementing these analog controls on a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.259 
implementing these analog controls on a
modern<00:00:42.839> digital<00:00:43.019> product<00:00:43.589> like<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> O<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.269> to

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
modern digital product like the O one to

aspects of the old one though is that it

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.290 
aspects of the old one though is that it
can<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:35.070> its<00:01:35.250> main<00:01:35.550> colour<00:01:35.909> screen

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300

can actually use its main colour screen
for<00:01:37.020> composition<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.100> makes<00:01:38.370> it<00:01:38.520> very
