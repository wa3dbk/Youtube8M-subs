00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
year and I think this is just a really
important<00:00:36.180> cause<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.170> that

about and having a support base that has

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.410

so<00:00:44.489> many<00:00:44.930> men<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> samiches<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so many men in it and samiches need to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
