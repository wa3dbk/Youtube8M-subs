00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
quite good at that time so that's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
quite good at that time so that's
probably<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.750> positive<00:02:50.140> rd<00:02:50.650> probably<00:02:51.010> lose<00:02:51.310> a

probably a positive rd probably lose a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.580 
probably a positive rd probably lose a
bit<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.520> work<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.720> know<00:02:52.840> 40<00:02:53.200> points<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.560> that

bit of work you know 40 points is that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.170

great<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.100> there<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.820> probably<00:02:55.030> another

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
great but there it's probably another

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.270 
great but there it's probably another
working<00:02:55.540> point<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:55.870> us<00:02:55.900> we<00:02:56.890> definitely<00:02:57.190> got

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
working point for us we definitely got

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.650 
working point for us we definitely got
out<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.520> foods<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:58.000> couple<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.270> areas<00:02:58.450> of

out and foods in a couple of areas of

out and foods in a couple of areas of
the<00:02:58.720> game<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.440> think<00:02:59.770> again<00:02:59.980> our

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
the game there I think again our

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.800 
the game there I think again our
scramblers<00:03:00.459> are<00:03:00.580> really<00:03:00.760> dominant<00:03:01.090> dominant

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
scramblers are really dominant dominant

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.270 
scramblers are really dominant dominant
form<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.170> us<00:03:02.290> moving<00:03:02.830> forward<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.250> think

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
form for us moving forward I think

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.890 
form for us moving forward I think
that's<00:03:03.489> gonna<00:03:03.580> be<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:03.970> key<00:03:04.180> key

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that's gonna be one of that key key

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.620 
that's gonna be one of that key key
features<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.440> game<00:03:05.590> moving<00:03:05.830> forwards<00:03:06.340> I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
features in the game moving forwards I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.550 
features in the game moving forwards I
think<00:03:07.630> if<00:03:07.750> we<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:07.989> just<00:03:08.020> work<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.320> bit<00:03:08.500> harder

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
think if we can just work a bit harder

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.080 
think if we can just work a bit harder
on<00:03:08.860> how<00:03:09.010> exits<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.550> being<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.850> bit<00:03:09.970> more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
on how exits and being a bit more

clinical<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.660> area<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.110> ball<00:03:11.200> out<00:03:11.380> I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
clinical in that area get the ball out I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.030 
clinical in that area get the ball out I
think<00:03:11.860> will<00:03:11.950> be<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.310> lot<00:03:12.640> better<00:03:12.700> next<00:03:12.940> week
