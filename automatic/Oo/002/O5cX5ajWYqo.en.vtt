hundred and seventy dollars now this was

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.870 
hundred and seventy dollars now this was
a<00:00:15.660> GPU<00:00:16.170> nvidia<00:00:16.619> kind<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.070> needed<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.550> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
a GPU nvidia kind of needed because you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.029 
a GPU nvidia kind of needed because you
have<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> gtx<00:00:18.600> 750ti<00:00:19.170> at<00:00:19.619> around<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.010> hundred

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
have the gtx 750ti at around one hundred

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
have the gtx 750ti at around one hundred
and<00:00:20.369> ten<00:00:20.550> dollars<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.119> then<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.689> jump<00:00:21.960> right

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
and ten dollars and then you jump right

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
and ten dollars and then you jump right
up<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> gtx<00:00:23.100> 960<00:00:23.609> at<00:00:23.730> around<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.150> hundred

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
up to the gtx 960 at around two hundred

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
up to the gtx 960 at around two hundred
dollars<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.170> never<00:00:25.350> had<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> graphics

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
dollars so they never had a graphics

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.009 
dollars so they never had a graphics
card<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.730> bridge<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> gap<00:00:27.390> between<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.869> two

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
card to bridge the gap between the two

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
card to bridge the gap between the two
but<00:00:28.170> now<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> gtx<00:00:29.849> 950

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
but now you do have one the gtx 950

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
but now you do have one the gtx 950
which<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> pretty<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.500> neutered<00:00:31.980> version

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
which is pretty much a neutered version

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.360 
which is pretty much a neutered version
of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> gtx<00:00:33.030> 960<00:00:33.890> obviously<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> being

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
of the gtx 960 obviously with it being

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670 
of the gtx 960 obviously with it being
significantly<00:00:36.030> cheaper<00:00:36.270> than<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> gtx<00:00:37.079> 960

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
significantly cheaper than the gtx 960

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
significantly cheaper than the gtx 960
around<00:00:38.010> forty<00:00:38.309> dollars<00:00:38.610> cheaper<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.600> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
around forty dollars cheaper you all be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
around forty dollars cheaper you all be
getting<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.559> performance<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> gtx

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
getting as good performance as the gtx

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.720 
getting as good performance as the gtx
960<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> looks<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> gtx<00:00:43.980> 950<00:00:44.309> will

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
960 but it looks like the gtx 950 will

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750 
960 but it looks like the gtx 950 will
be<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> solid<00:00:45.390> mid-range<00:00:45.840> GPU<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.190> considering

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
be a solid mid-range GPU but considering

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
be a solid mid-range GPU but considering
that<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> r9<00:00:48.450> 280x<00:00:50.870> 950<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> lot<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that the r9 280x 950 i see a lot of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
that the r9 280x 950 i see a lot of
people<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> GPU<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
people going for that GPU now at this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
people going for that GPU now at this
point<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:54.840> you're<00:00:54.960> buying<00:00:55.199> nvidia<00:00:55.710> GPU<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
point when you're buying nvidia GPU a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
point when you're buying nvidia GPU a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
big part of that price tag comes from

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
big part of that price tag comes from
the<00:00:58.230> software<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> nvidia<00:00:59.309> provides<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the software that nvidia provides and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the driver features and the fact that a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
the driver features and the fact that a
lot<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> games<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.520> performing<00:01:03.059> better<00:01:03.090> on

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
lot of games are performing better on

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
lot of games are performing better on
NVIDIA<00:01:03.930> GPUs<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.619> The<00:01:04.769> Witcher<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.519> we're

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

a<00:01:16.890> GPU<00:01:17.340> price<00:01:17.610> range<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> Nvidia<00:01:18.420> really

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
a GPU price range that Nvidia really

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
a GPU price range that Nvidia really
needed<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.470> said<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> went

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
from straight from the 750 Ti right into

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
from straight from the 750 Ti right into
the<00:01:22.650> 960<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.820> something<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> bridge

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the 960 you need something to bridge

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
the 960 you need something to bridge
those<00:01:24.780> two<00:01:25.049> price<00:01:25.320> points<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:25.770> 110<00:01:26.430> dollars

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
those two price points from 110 dollars

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.249 
those two price points from 110 dollars
all<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.750> hundred<00:01:27.780> dollars

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
all the way up to two hundred dollars

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.649 
all the way up to two hundred dollars
now<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.579> gtx<00:01:30.060> 960<00:01:30.420> one

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
now you do have one the gtx 960 one

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090
