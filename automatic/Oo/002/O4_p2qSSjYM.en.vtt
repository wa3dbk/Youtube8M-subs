00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
them first up we have storm bringer

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.529 
them first up we have storm bringer
which<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.399> dropped<00:00:44.640> by<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> grineer

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
which is dropped by the grineer

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.690 
which is dropped by the grineer
ballistic<00:00:46.140> ax<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> find<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.430> pretty

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ballistic ax which can be find on pretty

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.910 
ballistic ax which can be find on pretty
much<00:00:47.850> any<00:00:48.090> Granero<00:00:48.450> planet<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> stay<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
much any Granero planet if you stay in a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
much any Granero planet if you stay in a
survival<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> defense<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.239> long<00:00:51.390> enough<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
survival or a defense for long enough I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900 
survival or a defense for long enough I
recommend<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> planet<00:00:53.280> Saturn<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
recommend going to the planet Saturn and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
recommend going to the planet Saturn and
you'll<00:00:54.120> definitely<00:00:54.510> find<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.020> ballistic<00:00:55.620> ax

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you'll definitely find a ballistic ax

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
you'll definitely find a ballistic ax
and<00:00:55.920> any<00:00:56.070> mission<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.550> next<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and any mission there next up we have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
and any mission there next up we have
Pro<00:00:58.050> runs<00:00:58.350> which<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.590> dropped<00:00:58.949> by<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
Pro runs which is dropped by the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.040 
Pro runs which is dropped by the
shockwave<00:00:59.430> moon<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> corpus<00:01:00.690> enemy

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
shockwave moon this is a corpus enemy

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
shockwave moon this is a corpus enemy
that<00:01:01.289> usually<00:01:01.649> spawns<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> bite<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.940> after

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that usually spawns up a bite like after

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.910 
that usually spawns up a bite like after
the<00:01:03.570> 20<00:01:03.809> minute<00:01:04.080> mark<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> survival

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the 20 minute mark and a survival

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
the 20 minute mark and a survival
mission<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.630> high<00:01:06.810> level

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
mission so they are pretty high level

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
mission so they are pretty high level
but<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.799> recommend<00:01:08.040> doing<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
but what I recommend doing is going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
but what I recommend doing is going to
you<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.659> level<00:01:09.720> corpus<00:01:10.350> planet<00:01:10.710> such<00:01:10.860> as

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
you a high level corpus planet such as

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
you a high level corpus planet such as
Pluto<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.549> something<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.930> any

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
Pluto or something like that there any

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160 
Pluto or something like that there any
any<00:01:13.560> where<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.670> find<00:01:15.150> high-level<00:01:15.780> corpus

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
any where you can find high-level corpus

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
any where you can find high-level corpus
at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.280> shop<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.270> spawn

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
at the shop we have more as well spawn

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.289 
at the shop we have more as well spawn
so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.770> recommend<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.729> Mars<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.119> Venus

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so I recommend going to Mars or Venus

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
so I recommend going to Mars or Venus
and<00:01:21.840> staying<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> long<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> survival<00:01:23.250> or

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and staying a long time in a survival or

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
and staying a long time in a survival or
a<00:01:23.640> defense<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> high-level

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a defense or going to a high-level

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
a defense or going to a high-level
corpus<00:01:25.860> planets<00:01:26.220> such<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.400> Pluto<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> you're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
corpus planets such as Pluto and you're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
corpus planets such as Pluto and you're
guaranteed<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.740> shocked<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.159> more

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
guaranteed to get shocked with more

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.859 
guaranteed to get shocked with more
spawns<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.090> they'll<00:01:30.540> drop<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.930> cryo<00:01:31.229> rinds

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
spawns and they'll drop you cryo rinds

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.940 
spawns and they'll drop you cryo rinds
next<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.110> Hellfire<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
next up we have Hellfire which is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
next up we have Hellfire which is
dropped<00:01:35.189> by<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> shield<00:01:35.700> Osprey<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.900> too

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
dropped by the shield Osprey not too

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
dropped by the shield Osprey not too
uncommon<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> come<00:01:38.820> across<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
uncommon to come across but can be a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
uncommon to come across but can be a
little<00:01:40.350> uncommon<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> recommend<00:01:41.939> staying

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
little uncommon so I recommend staying

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
little uncommon so I recommend staying
about<00:01:42.390> 15<00:01:42.840> minutes<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.290> any<00:01:43.439> corpus<00:01:44.040> Survival

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
about 15 minutes in any corpus Survival

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.560 
about 15 minutes in any corpus Survival
to<00:01:45.149> Mars<00:01:45.420> Venus<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.820> any<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> those<00:01:48.149> but

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to Mars Venus again so any of those but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
to Mars Venus again so any of those but
they<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.049> spawn<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> cheat<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.159> marks<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
they don't spawn and cheat your marks so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
they don't spawn and cheat your marks so
you<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.140> trouble<00:01:52.740> getting

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you might actually have trouble getting

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
you might actually have trouble getting
Hellfire<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> drop<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.570> play<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:54.810> on

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
Hellfire to drop but just play around on

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440 
Hellfire to drop but just play around on
corpus<00:01:55.680> missions<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.610> guarantee<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.299> will
