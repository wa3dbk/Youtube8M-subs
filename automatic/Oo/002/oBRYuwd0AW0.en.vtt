I'm fully motivated.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.600
Here, at the All-Star Event, I will prove my skill.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.800

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
Misaya: This all-star team is filled with strong members of Team WE and Team IG.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.600
I have full confidence in WeiXiao and Troll,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.100
while PDD and XiaoXiao from IG are unquestionably talented.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000
I believe that when working together, we will bring out the best of each other as a team.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.100
XiaoXiao: In this team, Weixiao and I will fight together in the bot lane. Fans gave us the nickname: Three Xiao Group.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.400
However, though Xiao means "smiling" in Chinese, I don't think the name is only a joke.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.800
What we are going to do will make the people who support us smile.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.400

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.800
will enable he and I to be the tanks in the middle and late stages of the game.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.400
It will give our opponents a rough time.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.900
