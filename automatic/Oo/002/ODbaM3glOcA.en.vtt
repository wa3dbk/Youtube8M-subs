00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.790
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.980
 we would not have minecraft and this is a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.930
 so it 's cool, it's cool 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.790
 It has a lot of time but recently 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.010
 has come back in version 1.7 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.859
 point 2 which is in fact the fair version 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.480
 where I am now and well the mod the 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.070
 Stargate mold are like some portals 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.510
 super pimps that are based on a series 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.490
 which is called stargate and like many more 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.290
 you know but good and that also includes 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.150
 also new materials and other 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.470
 can also external villagers who 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 then we will talk about him or else 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.949
 first how it works in borno on a motorcycle 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.330
 we have to build a kind of 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.070
 portals that take us to other sites 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.350
 that are built with these three and with 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.640
 this one here and how are they built 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.309
 we have to build the chevron block 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.309
 the beige and the extra that the ring block 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.670
 it's worth it that we need 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.420
 put the chevrón we need 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.789
 sandstone luminous skin powder remains and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.219
 as you see that a few rare blocks that 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.780
 they call ingots take nothing to today 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.520
 in ghost is worth how these are made 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.310
 blocks put those that are made itching 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.700
 this here and it gives us what would be the na 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.409
 cadaqués and we mix it with a block of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.940
 iron, you see , what would be the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.149
 ingot what would it be to create this 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.960
 block here what to create this other we 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:27.220
 would need sandstone rest eye to sell 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.360
 two ingots of these and a core crystal 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.520
 that we are going to talk about them now 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.000
 ok we would do for the next 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.740
 patrick blog as sandstone and nothing this 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.819
 then I want theme to be a controller 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.479
 that this also very important that makes 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.860
 missing or if target buttons and a pearl 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.080
 sell and as it is here they have another 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 crystal that is how to control how 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.950
 get these crystals to be here 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.650
 I also think it was needed improved 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.600
 to improve him 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.340
 the prisoner portals right now does not 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.230
 would lack more advanced until it 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.460
 let's see the price that you see him and 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.410
 the thing is that it is to get your 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 crystals or we find it in chests with 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.070
 god out there to take by sack or have 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.470
 than to find one of these villagers who 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.000
 as you can see they are blond with red eyes 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.710
 we talk to you in this case sells the core 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.020
 crystal there are others who see in control 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.430
 in glass, and with that, nothing 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.600
 we give eight emeralds and a diamond and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.850
 you would give it to us because it would make us 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.410
 missing to build our portal and it 's 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.180
 well it would be how the portal is built 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.760
 is here because we're going to show you how 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.470
 do we are going to do the portal and what 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.360
 first that you have to put is the base in 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.680
 the center would be this and then you have to 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.209
 put 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.950
 the river and a chevron and so do it until 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.020
 up to the top as it does I 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.010
 now a river a jet 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.740
 with a ring 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.140
 a chevron 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.110
 jim risch and now when to contribute 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.400
 mix when we put the last chevron 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.810
 weissel because it is totally circular to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.730
 handsome image as you get closer a lot is going 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.640
 at least version 1.2 I do not know if it is 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.800
 version 16.4 also happens the same 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.050
 but he had certain courageous failures 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.640
 neither is perfect and good what is 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.500
 special this is worth it because this would be the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.690
 portal and if we give right click on 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 I would not leave what is your key that had 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.380
 targeted boy worth 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.750
 the key is you can fix the symbols 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.920
 that crazy you can point the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.690
 Let's not be two bird efe 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.510
 sm 9 sl is not going to need us 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.640
 they are simply the first to be these 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.160
 four and the next three is worth not 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.930
 you're going to need none more worth and for 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.920
 to be able to activate this portal what 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.120
 we need in the other that is the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.580
 controller that is what we need 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.170
 the other military is worth we put there and the 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.730
 controller to use it you see that you have 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.410
 like some things and like a beige one 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.900
 little thing and like gray because you have to 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.660
 press on that and put fuel that 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 the fuel is the nothing worth you put 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.930
 the fuel gives you this right by 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.300
 dispose is the fuel we put it 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 there we would simply have to 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.200
 activate it here and we can or give the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.120
 keys one by one with the letters that 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.769
 come out or directly write it I have 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 another portal create other sites and I'll 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.530
 put it in the keys of the three agr 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.690
 zh l then one truth is we have it to 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.450
 I do not give the portal the ball of 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.100
 center that is how you see it is activated and 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.569
 Now this is turning looking for each 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.390
 symbol and activating each chevrolet 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.609
 entering activating activating 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.470
 the key in all its splendor because the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.380
 effect is a pass that was rotating 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.770
 now I was active chevron like 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.770
 stay there 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.680
 we would already have this portal connected to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.509
 another site the gate to which it is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.270
 connected no longer spends fuel only 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.759
 Spends fuel when links to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 others and now I'm going to do well blog to 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.419
 leave in this other vale that is here 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.889
 all act and so well a little 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.570
 I 've done it so you can see that 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.250
 it's different go here we have what 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.410
 would be the other portal that right now if 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.820
 I look here in the in this I would have to 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.710
 leave that is connected does not come out 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.449
 because it 's on but it 's 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.520
 connected or if I enter here 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.680
 I'm going to continue now for the other thing you see 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 ok and now I'm going to show you how it goes 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.880
 unlike circus if you want 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.680
 turn it off and launch it to another portal 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.509
 we give here to button 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.490
 that portal goes out we give it back to you 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.110
 there and in this case we would write the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.970
 key to the other that we have pointed out before 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.919
 two 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:17.150
 ap / efe sm9 we give here and now to 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.190
 look for your chevron codes there 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.050
 Search for them you really see the truth 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.540
 has the symbolics and looks exactly 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.920
 the symbols that they are - it's not that the 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.260
 forests and poetry there are times that turns 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.460
 a lot and others that are very very little and 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.000
 is that it depends on the distance at which 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.810
 is the code not to say there it becomes 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.670
 to open and we walk again I know 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.160
 that there are many other portal modes 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.540
 that are much easier to do and that 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.280
 they do not have the theme this codes 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.770
 more but to me this seems authentic 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.740
 move to that effect in this portal as well 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.170
 as if it was a wave I find it incredible 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.510
 he deserves the coolest I've seen 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.710
 in minecraft of street also already has 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.960
 that you look for the materials looking for 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.500
 villagers have to get in the house 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.940
 and I think it's an authentic chulada 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.410
 That's it, guys, and I hope that I have 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.600
 liked and let's see how is this 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.180
 mode for this end is done as 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.860
 everyone else as always and good and 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.420
 you know you need the force and lost and 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.220
 fine that you have it in the description of 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.720
 video you said change the file of the 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.670
 mod that you have both version 1.6 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.500
 point 4 as version 1.7 point 2 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.730
 also in the description of the video that 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.140
 we have to do once we have 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.449
 the force jyoti find in our version 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.249
 Well, we just have to have our folder 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.139
 for that we have to hit the button 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:29.900
 windows 7 at the same time the windows button 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.469
 is on the keyboard to the left / 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.479
 control windows and exactly there 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.669
 is here to execute the law there you put 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.039
 percentage pp data percentage you give to 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.930
 accept and here the dot folder will come out 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.520
 minecraft enter inside / is the folder 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.930
 mods that will be created if you have 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.819
 been well the fort hood and fine as 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.199
 outside the videos of the description and 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.309
 there is little that is the version that touches you 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.900
 I for example we have been using what 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.999
 pointed to this point 2 then copy already the 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.289
 version of the 1.7 points two ideals that 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.520
 enter minecraft I already had a dispute 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.020
 I would have available everything that would be 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.460
 the stargate a data that you have to 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.960
 keep in mind is that like this mode 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.810
 add a new order that is the order to 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.610
 every if you want to find or in the 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.589
 world if you do not want to take it out as creative 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.029
 you have to create a world again 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.469
 It's worth a world that you will have done because 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.150
 that world has already been generated then not 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.710
 they have the blocks of nothing generated by 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.050
 No place do you have to create a new one
