00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.890
 good morning today I will show you how it is 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 performs the sewing method with i 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.299
 three irons is a very nice method 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.300
 according to me to combine two pieces of work 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.550
 knit and makes a very seam 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.330
 nice also to see on the right side 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.369
 for this type of closure naturally 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 the work is arranged on 2 rows and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 we need an additional iron 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.469
 because precisely if not the explanation is not 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.440
 name then the thread passes behind and is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 the one who commands 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.170
 we have to do a lot of work 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.710
 well on the two irons after which we enter 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the first shirt on the first iron 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.719
 we enter the second jersey on 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:11.760
 second iron is as if it were a 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:16.470
 crochet we fish the shirt and the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.580
 let's slide through all e 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.759
 two 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.850
 all those points after that we do 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:32.090
 drop the two shirts and we have a point 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.090
 we repeat the same thing 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.040
 we fish for this kind of closure 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.720
 sometimes I use if the yarn 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.009
 particularly thin even a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.899
 crochet instead of irons we do 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.729
 fall at this point we have two 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.890
 sweaters 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.430
 at this point we must close them and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.430
 so we do it with our usual 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 method 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.359
 et voila we repeat 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:25.990
 we are falling and we must always close 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.630
 have only one shirt on the iron of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 right we go forward 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.510
 close 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330
 go on 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.500
 tenco 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.670
 continuing so we see that we have one 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.670
 beautiful chain on the reverse side of the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 their nature nothing and if we turn we have 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.650
 this beautiful seam well and all for 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.650
 today to the next
