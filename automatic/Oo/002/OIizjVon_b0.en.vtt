00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.000
 colon greeting everyone today let's talk about economy and the victim 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 the migration assistant is called 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.799
 and that evo I do not see very inconvenient especially the people what a given moment 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.800
 it was that lost key commented suaya deleted a disk bought trova 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.630
 here want 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.640
 is to have it configured as another one that I already had 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.770
 for this the utilities that can have 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.450
 this application but it is very intuitive tanda less for me I find it quite 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.579
 and it's very related to issues 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.589
 for this we are going to go now applies actions 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.070
 to utilities 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.300
 and within units peris there is a point 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 nor with what is like two caritas one opa in dermatitis or more blue 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 shamah migration assistant 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 lets go see it 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.159
 the first thing he tells us that tells us a bit what we can transfer 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.590
 I ccoo here for example 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.710
 we can transfer 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.720
 in user accounts applications adjust network of files that we have 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.300
 it's about transferring 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.970
 d dt joachim ie from an external disk or from another computer 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.180
 percent to our computer locke me for example I have here configured 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.060
 mirta demarchi 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 this one already denounced that it posed to continue 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.680
 what if we do not put the password of 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.759
 - your computer 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:22.930
 in front of the bar 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.530
 and here is a little grace all this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.439
 how is betting fer and information 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.920
 after doing it from another more 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.430
 if we have another more connected to this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 we could say then for example 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.080
 percent 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.450
 I remove all the photos 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 I take to the pictures all the music to the confrontation 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.740
 percent 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.170
 I can not think of email accounts 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.680
 everyone would transfer it to this one is not going to for example that you just bought 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.970
 it is worth so much empty heart that the one that appears marked by detected that it is not 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.670
 an upload so machin 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 or from another hard drive for this is important when for example 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.749
 if we want to erase 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.590
 it occurs to me to erase the entire disk such as what would be windows a format 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.850
 i the egg for example retrieve the documents but for example not the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.629
 applications is now we will see how it can be done 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.719
 or for example recover the culture has been 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.880
 yoquese of the images for example 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.810
 all that dental equipment but 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.340
 you have not 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.020
 not the applications but for example also yes 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.360
 the network configuration by saying something to say select a bit what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.089
 we want 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.089
 and all this from Chinese theme that is a hard drive 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.499
 and finally gave us option b 4 sea is to say 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.379
 the inverse process of the first option 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.699
 if the first one was 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.069
 challenge bring them from intromac this will send to take 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.209
 For this, it is the same to draw from the same inverse process if it had 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.739
 compared with eta to a laptop or vox I want 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.599
 enter the information 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.319
 the sexiest commodore more 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.789
 I think that more hours to use is from a copy of eta and matxín 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.379
 pane in case you deleted taste 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.869
 hard drive or style erase it 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.730
 as in the story I was joking 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.519
 although good that we will talk about is not very 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.419
 per cent we do not tire we recommend but that 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.359
 it really is not going to be very useful to us worse 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.939
 Tremosa the remaining 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.970
 from subjects we give them the disc and in this case 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.379
 It's the only one I have, it's 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.710
 and then good 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.420
 these processes will last a bit as an excuse to do 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.079
 Let's remove the files if you want them to be sent 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.540
 I do not know it indicates exactly which smoke files one is going to send by 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.139
 example 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.049
 the applications folder 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.289
 the selection to Moscow we selected 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.749
 ee is a whole block that is, we can only send 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.419
 all applications by any application 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.930
 when it is important to send all applications man was above all it is 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.939
 important 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.429
 when 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:56.219
 three applications have happen live cancellation of fanta 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.889
 cheese onziema souvenir martín cuenca and 3 gigas aragones and that man 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.819
 By the way, tennis on dvd that tennis on discs 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.309
 if you have been a little ask for non-working days that the moles fell down because of 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.649
 a little complicated 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:14.379
 is looking forward to what 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.160
 that in fine thin layer 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.569
 although they are free even if they are free 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:22.589
 you have to know what textile I have to look for to recover them in that case 

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.520
 it would be convenient to leave side 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.699
 the users 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.900
 coves and a small tab that can be deployed 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.180
 I'm going to do it 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.639
 and as you can see I have in this case I 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.830
 and other users that I have here 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.389
 if the wait is dust juar the second to appear sucks and gives 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.909
 how are you calculating the 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.909
 since you assured them they could see what you have for 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.930
 to receive or not to take what you have desktop a document to the downloads 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.650
 movies for example imagine 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.990
 that I want to recover from this user 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.800
 what about the writer and I want the documents and because I have and documents 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.240
 a long time ago and a lot to the security Monaco 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.340
 the download but 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.879
 because I already managed it 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.539
 the movies either 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.940
 because herria will not save the music if it interests me 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.900
 example that my adventure library 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.770
 is intact 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.080
 the images also because the good deceased library cost a lot 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.009
 let's leave it 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.249
 the publican because he currently did not use brewer either 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.809
 other files and folders well I anointed him he would leave it in case he could have 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.589
 some file 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.430
 there important távora 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.419
 It is not very relevant either 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.939
 for blind you can see now for example what of a little eye what it said 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.309
 extra for the subject of what space was calculated 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.430
 this would be for example the configuration of this one put to it 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.770
 with the adjustments we do not deploy also and we have the time zone that goes this 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.610
 case coincides that I'm not interested caught back for it or that sanctifies 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.939
 little breed 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.490
 It is a great importance 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.680
 on computer 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.270
 are adjustments ordered the same 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.089
 and about the same network in fact these three as you see the size or are 19 133 cases 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.089
 I almost would leave it since we have made some previous adjustments 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.259
 and not to serve 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.370
 and finally 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.580
 percent this other files and folders worthy 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.599
 of the naxara of these bishops 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.449
 pull out 20 photos file writer is calculating the size is going to be enough 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.029
 that we have and I want has classifieds have these locks of 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.029
 in users applications you settings 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.119
 as I tell you, you can play 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.469
 h 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:29.860
 abel luque 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.039
 crazy interest address what we want to save 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.289
 what you want to get it back or that is to recover again if simple 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.180
 a defeat if we had everything 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 when I finish calculating it from calculating that it is the size 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.719
 I will leave you quipus to continue 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.449
 someone would have to say no because he's still calculating 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.879
 but well the idea is exactly that 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.959
 that through the investigation you can recover a copy of such power 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.779
 such as tennis the computer for example a previous state 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.459
 what would this case be Chávez before this moment imagine that we have deleted and 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.689
 we are going to recover the computer as we had steelworks days consists 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.869
 the last copy the machine 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:11.629
 equally in addition to that 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.689
 that time you can not do the emirate from a computer other 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.689
 winners 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:18.999
 for harrison go 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.550
 to the operation assistant an application very very very 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.909
 to consider 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.179
 when you want to erase with what was the index of having another computer 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:29.889
 with some things just like 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:31.509
 than another one that you have 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:32.650
 that is to say 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.149
 do some affirmed that nation start the word 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:37.629
 show more 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:41.449
 another day we will talk about the machine that great unknown and that great ally 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:42.469
 many times 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.059
 a greeting from invoice
