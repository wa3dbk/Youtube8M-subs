 Mushi 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 if long stare into the dark smo 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 penetrate into your eyes the inner eye 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.020
 opened what is hidden in darkness but 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.449
 eyes do not see anything more inheritance 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 the victim will become a closet and close 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.590
 be afraid to catch a contagious disease 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779

 darkness, he will let her husband in his eyes 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 from time immemorial people have been afraid of husband and creatures 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 unlike animals not people 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 living on so close to the source 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 life and from having a shaped 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.899
 bizarre but infinitely far from 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920
 human free and simple 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 little creatures that don't carry 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.000
 harm or parasites that change the body 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.000
 carrier 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.780
 Many see the man and those who succeed 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 they are often not seen taking 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 talk about under imagination but how would 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 people did not deny out of fear 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 of not ordered the number of people and husband and tight 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.270
 husbands are touching and can cause 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 diseases or unsolvable misfortune 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 to their will but only because of the way 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 man and husband and crossed and of course 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.370
 there are those who are husband and study and help 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 people cope with misfortunes arising 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.390
 due to collisions with them this is a master 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 ears and one of them the main character of the series 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 and connecting thread between the ginko series he 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 not a killer and not a hunter and do not chase 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 place creatures inhabiting the disembodied 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.330
 he is a tireless researcher ready 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.009
 go to any part of the world for the sake of 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 In order to see what is not yet 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.479
 faced king aimlessly travels 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 taking any job that came to him 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 or going to help someone 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 wrote him a letter complaining about his husband and he 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 so tightly connected with the world is the husband and that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.000
 they became part of himself he restrained 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.430
 calm and always know what to do 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 he smokes a lot but with this habit you 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.179
 understand in the first series with him 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 no one eyes and this is one of the most 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.979
 of the great mysteries of the story of foam 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.140
 the other knows that the husband and very rarely bear 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.539
 intends to harm and therefore helping 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.180
 for the victims he helps them find peace 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.580
 discovering the truth of intersecting ways 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.160
 people and husband and the time interval of the series 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.819
 the end of the edo period with the majestic 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.040
 by the mountains 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.510
 green in summer and covered in dense 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.790
 snow cover in winter 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.060
 lush forests and small trees 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 Komi landscapes shining like not crazy 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.579
 the animation itself is no different 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.469
 elaboration 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.629
 here are only memorable 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.790
 some characters like samghin 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.859
 to with his white hair bangs on the left 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.560
 other eyes after a few episodes 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.569
 merge into one face with narrow eyes and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.939
 black hair in which we see 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.379
 typical japanese resident small 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.079
 villages for me personally it 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.239
 extra atmosphere I felt that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.340
 look japan i felt the spirit 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.930
 village legends that simple people 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.239
 passes each other from generation to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 generation has been kicking me and creeps from 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.049
 all the details 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.599
 and I'm not in the big picture myself standing will inflict 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.579
 speakers there is no integrity it's not us 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.319
 not one of those that can be watched for two days 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.720
 excitedly coming off just to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.519
 pour yourself a coffee on the contrary it causes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.950
 desire to stretch pleasure 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.019
 letting each episode cut in you 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.629
 music seems so 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.389
 natural lungs not attractive to 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.470
 yourself extra attention a 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.659
 introductory now revising 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.340
 every time I liked it so much 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.209
 music I did not see in it minus a 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.729
 vice versa 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.799
 after watching overflow the whole movie search 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.989
 in order to find the same atmospheric took off 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.659
 agree after all very rarely simplicity is not 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.030
 cheapness incoherence turns into 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.069
 becomes chaos measured not 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.349
 turns into slowness from this 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.729
 series can be learned morals 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.810
 feel deep philosophical 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.269
 subtext 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.979
 and you can just enjoy it for 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.620
