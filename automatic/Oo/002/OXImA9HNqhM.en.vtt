in<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.519> movie<00:00:08.730> I'm<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> look<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.330> some

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
in this movie I'm going to look at some

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.959 
in this movie I'm going to look at some
creative<00:00:09.840> uses<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.349> custom<00:00:11.099> alpha<00:00:11.490> textures

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
creative uses of custom alpha textures

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.079 
creative uses of custom alpha textures
in<00:00:12.450> shadow<00:00:12.870> box<00:00:13.170> I've<00:00:14.040> imported<00:00:14.519> some<00:00:14.700> custom

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
in shadow box I've imported some custom

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330 
in shadow box I've imported some custom
alphas<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> created<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.560> Adobe<00:00:17.010> Photoshop

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
alphas that I created in Adobe Photoshop

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
alphas that I created in Adobe Photoshop
these<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.970> grayscale<00:00:18.539> images<00:00:19.020> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
these are just grayscale images that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.460 
these are just grayscale images that
have<00:00:19.830> imported<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.330> Alpha<00:00:21.990> flyout

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
have imported into the Alpha flyout

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
have imported into the Alpha flyout
library<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.189> i'm<00:00:23.519> using<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.150> masking<00:00:25.019> pen

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
library and i'm using the masking pen

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.730 
library and i'm using the masking pen
with<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> rectangular<00:00:26.660> stroke<00:00:27.660> type<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.529> draw

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
with a rectangular stroke type to draw

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.429 
with a rectangular stroke type to draw
these<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> front<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.880> shadow<00:00:30.689> box<00:00:30.960> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
these out on the front of shadow box you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.540 
these out on the front of shadow box you
see<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.769> come<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.309> nice

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
see and come up with a very nice

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.350 
see and come up with a very nice
clean-looking<00:00:33.680> hard<00:00:34.680> surface<00:00:35.100> object<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:36.239> as

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
clean-looking hard surface object now as

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
clean-looking hard surface object now as
fun<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.870> could<00:00:37.020> switch<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> side

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
fun as I could switch over to a side

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090 
fun as I could switch over to a side
view<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.520> choose<00:00:39.149> another<00:00:39.480> custom<00:00:39.989> alpha<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
view and choose another custom alpha in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
view and choose another custom alpha in
the<00:00:41.250> stroke<00:00:41.579> type<00:00:41.820> library<00:00:42.360> i'm<00:00:42.510> turning<00:00:42.870> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the stroke type library i'm turning on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
the stroke type library i'm turning on
the<00:00:43.079> square<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> center<00:00:44.070> options<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the square and center options so that

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
the square and center options so that
when<00:00:45.120> i<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> rectangular<00:00:47.039> stroke<00:00:47.579> type

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
when i use the rectangular stroke type

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450 
when i use the rectangular stroke type
the<00:00:48.480> alpha<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> perfectly<00:00:49.379> square<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.160> comes

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the alpha is perfectly square it comes

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
the alpha is perfectly square it comes
from<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> center<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.300> where<00:00:51.449> i<00:00:51.480> drive<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
from the center of where i drive with my

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
from the center of where i drive with my
brush<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> result<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> combination<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
brush so the result is a combination of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
brush so the result is a combination of
the<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.230> shapes<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> front<00:00:56.370> view<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the two shapes from the front view and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.150 
the two shapes from the front view and
the<00:00:56.879> side<00:00:57.090> view<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> i<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.710> clean<00:00:58.949> this

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the side view and i can clean this

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
the side view and i can clean this
object<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:01.109> expanding<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
object up a little bit by expanding the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.250 
object up a little bit by expanding the
deformations<00:01:02.370> palette<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.170> increasing<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
deformations palette and increasing the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
deformations palette and increasing the
relax<00:01:04.619> slider<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> also<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> polish<00:01:06.960> slider

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
relax slider and also the polish slider

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
relax slider and also the polish slider
just<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> even<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> surface<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
just to even out the surface and at this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.210 
just to even out the surface and at this
point<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.380> sculpting<00:01:10.830> brushes

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
point I can take my sculpting brushes

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.730 
point I can take my sculpting brushes
and<00:01:11.400> turn<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:11.970> whatever<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and turn this into whatever I want and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.289 
and turn this into whatever I want and
the<00:01:13.860> interesting<00:01:13.979> thing<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.460> using<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the interesting thing about using this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
the interesting thing about using this
technique<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.170> coming<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.590> shapes

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
technique is I'm coming up with shapes

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.530 
technique is I'm coming up with shapes
that<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.159> probably<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.299> thought

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that I probably would not have thought

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.649 
that I probably would not have thought
of<00:01:18.869> using<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.979> means<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.580> ZBrush<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
of using other means in ZBrush and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
of using other means in ZBrush and
that's<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> real<00:01:22.170> fun<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.799> shadow<00:01:23.040> box

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's where the real fun of shadow box

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.560 
that's where the real fun of shadow box
is<00:01:24.110> I'm<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> clear<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
is I'm going to clear this one out and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.760 
is I'm going to clear this one out and
experiment<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> using

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
experiment with a little bit with using

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
experiment with a little bit with using
radial<00:01:29.159> symmetry<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> choose

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
radial symmetry so I'm going to choose

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.929 
radial symmetry so I'm going to choose
another<00:01:30.600> alpha<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.670> go<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
another alpha here and go to the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.350 
another alpha here and go to the
transform<00:01:33.509> palette<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.159> turn<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.430> activate

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
transform palette and turn on activate

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
transform palette and turn on activate
symmetry<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.430> also<00:01:38.430> activate<00:01:38.880> radial

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
symmetry and also activate radial

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
symmetry and also activate radial
symmetry<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.740> sending<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> slider

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
symmetry and I'm sending it a slider

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
symmetry and I'm sending it a slider
down<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.869> will<00:01:42.990> create<00:01:43.140> three

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
down to three so this will create three

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
down to three so this will create three
instances<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.790> alpha<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
instances of my alpha and this is the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
instances of my alpha and this is the
shape<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.799> come<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> drag<00:01:47.790> on

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
shape that I come up with when I drag on

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.219 
shape that I come up with when I drag on
the<00:01:48.000> front<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.890> shadow<00:01:49.890> box<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the front of shadow box now when you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710 
the front of shadow box now when you
create<00:01:52.610> meshes<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.790> shadow<00:01:54.030> box<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.659> are

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
create meshes with shadow box they are

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
create meshes with shadow box they are
automatically<00:01:55.350> organized<00:01:55.860> into<00:01:56.189> polygroups

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
automatically organized into polygroups

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
automatically organized into polygroups
if<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> poly<00:01:57.570> group<00:01:57.719> button<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
if you have a poly group button on and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
if you have a poly group button on and
this<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.640> very<00:01:59.820> convenient<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.509> now

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
this can be very convenient because now

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.090 
this can be very convenient because now
I<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.840> take<00:02:01.049> advantage<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.560> group<00:02:01.799> loops

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I can take advantage of group loops

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.700 
I can take advantage of group loops
which<00:02:02.490> creates<00:02:02.850> edge<00:02:03.090> loops

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
which creates edge loops

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.440 
which creates edge loops
on<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.860> border<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.430> each<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.970> poly<00:02:05.180> groups

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
on the border of each of the poly groups

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.139 
on the border of each of the poly groups
and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.350> can<00:02:06.530> also<00:02:06.710> toggle<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.460> visibility<00:02:07.490> of

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and I can also toggle the visibility of

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.419 
and I can also toggle the visibility of
each<00:02:08.360> polygroup<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.380> control<00:02:09.830> shift<00:02:10.100> clicking

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
each polygroup I control shift clicking

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.210 
each polygroup I control shift clicking
on<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.940> polygroup<00:02:11.330> surface<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.170> at<00:02:13.100> this

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
on the polygroup surface and at this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.340 
on the polygroup surface and at this
point<00:02:13.459> I'm<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.870> experimenting<00:02:14.870> using<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
point I'm just experimenting using the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.760 
point I'm just experimenting using the
inflate<00:02:15.770> slider<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:17.060> puff<00:02:17.540> out<00:02:17.810> or<00:02:18.170> shrink<00:02:18.560> in

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
inflate slider to puff out or shrink in

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.400 
inflate slider to puff out or shrink in
the<00:02:19.520> different<00:02:20.209> polygroups<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.020> this

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the different polygroups and this

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.890 
the different polygroups and this
creates<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.830> nice<00:02:22.010> sort<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.340> hard<00:02:22.610> edge<00:02:22.900> along

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
creates a nice sort of hard edge along

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.920 
creates a nice sort of hard edge along
the<00:02:24.110> contours<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.890> surface<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.900> is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
the contours of the surface so this is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.020 
the contours of the surface so this is
the<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.680> type<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:30.950> surface<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.670> come<00:02:31.850> up

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the the type of surface that I come up

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.930 
the the type of surface that I come up
with<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.980> other<00:02:34.010> thing<00:02:34.250> i'd<00:02:34.489> like<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.790> try

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
with and one other thing i'd like to try

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.080 
with and one other thing i'd like to try
is<00:02:35.330> experiment<00:02:36.260> by<00:02:36.380> filling<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.130> different

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
is experiment by filling the different

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.490 
is experiment by filling the different
parts<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.510> surface<00:02:38.959> with<00:02:39.140> different

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
parts of the surface with different

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.970 
parts of the surface with different
colors<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> I'm<00:02:41.810> basically<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.530> hiding<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
colors so I'm basically just hiding the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.820 
colors so I'm basically just hiding the
rest<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> surface<00:02:43.930> choosing<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.019> color<00:02:45.200> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
rest of the surface choosing a color and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
rest of the surface choosing a color and
using<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> fill<00:02:46.610> object<00:02:47.180> option<00:02:48.140> in<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
using the fill object option in the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.620 
using the fill object option in the
color<00:02:48.590> palette<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.550> fill<00:02:49.760> each<00:02:50.030> part<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.570> the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
color palette to fill each part of the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.160 
color palette to fill each part of the
surface<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.290> different<00:02:51.650> color<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:53.170> this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
surface with a different color and this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.590 
surface with a different color and this
is<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> result<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.890> get<00:02:55.100> which<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:56.330> know<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
is the result I get which you know it's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.440 
is the result I get which you know it's
kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.340> starting<00:02:58.340> place<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:58.610> inspiration

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
kind of a starting place for inspiration

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.860 
kind of a starting place for inspiration
for<00:02:59.690> interesting<00:03:00.320> objects
