she's she's the producer her company is

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.140 
she's she's the producer her company is
and<00:00:47.050> she'd<00:00:48.040> had<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.340> idea<00:00:48.640> for<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.879> couple<00:00:49.120> of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
and she'd had the idea for a couple of

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.610 
and she'd had the idea for a couple of
years<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.570> she<00:00:49.690> just<00:00:49.870> worked<00:00:50.110> on<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.470> and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
years and she just worked on it and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.830 
years and she just worked on it and
she'd<00:00:50.800> always<00:00:50.949> had<00:00:51.250> me<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.059> dolly<00:00:52.270> in<00:00:52.540> mind

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
she'd always had me and dolly in mind

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.950 
she'd always had me and dolly in mind
from<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.620> very<00:00:53.650> beginning<00:00:54.220> she<00:00:54.250> had<00:00:54.640> what

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
from the very beginning she had what

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.509 
from the very beginning she had what
dolly<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.199> unusual<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.800> me<00:00:56.890> because<00:00:57.160> she's<00:00:57.309> not

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
dolly is unusual to me because she's not

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.880 
dolly is unusual to me because she's not
known<00:00:58.180> as<00:00:58.330> an<00:00:58.449> actress<00:00:58.870> know<00:00:59.320> right

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
known as an actress know right

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.170 
known as an actress know right
so<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.100> seemed<00:01:00.309> strange<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.700> me<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:00.910> she

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
so it seemed strange to me that she

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.940 
so it seemed strange to me that she
would<00:01:01.300> think<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.720> dolly<00:01:02.050> for<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.380> part<00:01:02.649> well<00:01:02.920> I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
would think of dolly for the part well I

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.040 
would think of dolly for the part well I
think<00:01:03.070> she<00:01:03.430> had<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:03.790> much<00:01:03.970> admiration<00:01:04.630> for

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
think she had so much admiration for

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.469 
think she had so much admiration for
dolly<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.580> dolly<00:01:06.790> has<00:01:07.149> so<00:01:07.360> much

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
dolly and because and dolly has so much

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.120 
dolly and because and dolly has so much
