00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.230
 wei hi everyone we find ourselves on the 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.910
 review of episode 2 191 of naruto 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.079
 shippuden should not be said tchicala 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.239
 episode 2 of 6 so on line at once 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.919
 we had left with the village 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.110
 who was shooting the flash back on the 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.419
 village that was catching fire now we 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.279
 start right away with combat 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.180
 so we see naruto fighting on 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.140
 kabuto so if you remember well 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.730
 kabuto of the city ​​launches a species of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.670
 snake who searched who was going to drown 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.730
 naruto so naruto lets himself down and hop 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.620
 the cagb china he blew up the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.070
 snake so very very very very very 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.250
 good idea 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.190
 last night of water the fight we will say 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.079
 rages of short films before 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.809
 kabuto so decides to flee 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.440
 for apart for apparently 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.020
 perfect your technique 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.100
 so I did not talk to them about their faith 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.219
 is what do you advise of 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.699
 drawing and so the quality of six 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.439
 episodes 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.500
 I honestly love it I find it 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.479
 really good I think it makes me 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.429
 actually think of the naruto movie so I 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.659
 find it really great so what is it 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.969
 what do you think about it and especially what is 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.799
 that you think of the head 2-2 kabuto 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.840
 which is different from its real maybe 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.100
 normally so that's what 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.299
 you think I'm interested 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 frankly I am rather a fan of this 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.000
 drawing quality 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.530
 this is your opinion 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.050
 alain know what people think 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.440
 in short, we continue as I say 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.870
 kabuto this withdrawal so we see a lot 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.140
 so two cookies and the dock the big 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.660
 sir who saved the children 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 occupy the village so they are 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.110
 all together we see them a little bit 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.280
 in the city see a little the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.869
 relationships that they maintain 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.790
 companies so it's all cute 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.240
 until he crosses the road to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 so and naruto and sakura and then there 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.970
 it's the shock 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 she then saw he starts all of 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.869
 after being scared just because the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.170
 road made 1 so konoha logo 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.640
 on on his headband since 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.890
 during the night they are attacked 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 by ninjas from the bottle had 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.550
 one among them who were hayat esteemed 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.500
 do not cheat or who belong to konoha 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 which they took fright they tried to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.870
 run away in a lot and the little ones 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 children there are waters 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250
 there is a thousand to his little sister at the l1 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.650
 called phase and another that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.390
 is called landau so he runs away on a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.450
 bridge falls fall 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 naruto balances are all right here 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.750
 starts to discuss together they get 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.580
 realize that they do not want harm 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.880
 to accompanied person so it's rather 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.269
 nice and in fact so we learn that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.220
 apparently the male of two villages 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.019
 which would have been done because I 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.700
 including 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.400
 divided into this melody there surely 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.200
 a report I think with the small mine 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.880
 so I do not stop doing the same 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 melody all the time so we'll see 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 later 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.900
 it's a bit crazy for now but we 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.910
 will see what will happen with that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.670
 and finally at the end we see that at the end of the bone 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.739
 who discusses with someone leaves by a 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.970
 parchment so an invisible person 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.040
 who writes on a parchment 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 so in your opinion who knows with whom he 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.120
 speak he 's training this 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.829
 Year rice deidara go to the tennis 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.920
 is not good and he talks with someone 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.780
 we do not know who it is 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.130
 so what do you think 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.720
 I would have thought it would be something else 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.430
 my wheel but at one point he's talking about 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.410
 romao so that means it's not 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.400
 so he honestly I do not know the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.959
 all with whom you can talk bah listen 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.120
 give me your opinion I do not know if 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.340
 someone can find the identity of 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.020
 this famous at least visible I want 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.080
 to say in any case we do not know it's 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.090
 who this year enough episode enough 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.319
 how to say pretty cool we go elsewhere 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 not had a lot of fights it was 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.980
 rather it was rather that's the cool one 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.450
 little bit there was a little flashback 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.880
 is a bit of everything I would have 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.370
 forgot I've forgotten about 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.930
 talk about the relationship between chi her 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.060
 wheels and a lot of men chisso that's 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.560
 the lady who looks a little bit like 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.850
 short and handy can say and a lot 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.560
 so that's the big guy who was 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.720
 keeper and who has gained weight according to 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 what we said we saw that there was a small 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.530
 flashback actually who explained to us 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.170
 that she had to fall off a cliff with 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.250
 two shots had tried to save her 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.600
 unfortunately students do not train 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.890
 a lot did not have that force for 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.470
 the future despite it being 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.180
 plus an hour at arm's length and had a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.769
 franc has risen between that which is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.930
 installed say because of this 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.519
 history and we see the end that is 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.870
 take a look at the little ones 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.180
 to sleep and that would be entrusted so 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.860
 it's rather it's pretty cool 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 anyway that's the big question in 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.050
 anyway who is this person 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.610
 invisible 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.810
 I think we'll find out in the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.800
 next episodes there are still four 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.960
 so pretty impatient ways 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.000
 listen I hope the little review 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.340
 you enjoyed it impatiently 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.950
 episode number 3 out of 6 so what 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.800
 will finally take place that will come out of the least 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.210
 next Thursday hoping that you 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.680
 and more than once left a small 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.110
 lay a comment we do not hesitate 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.330
 to discuss all this I will answer your 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.890
 comments of course and then listen on 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.820
 is saying ah the next here is hi to 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.820
 all and china beach to water
