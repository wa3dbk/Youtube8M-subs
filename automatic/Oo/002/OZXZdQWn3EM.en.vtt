today<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.350> talk<00:00:01.560> about<00:00:01.740> the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
today we're going to talk about the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.830 
today we're going to talk about the
simplicity<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:02.970> game<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.629> it's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
simplicity of this game and how it's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.749 
simplicity of this game and how it's
been<00:00:03.990> complicated<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.980> compromised<00:00:05.520> so

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
been complicated and compromised so

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.629 
been complicated and compromised so
badly<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:07.109> many<00:00:07.290> people<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.130> lived<00:00:08.429> this

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
badly so many people have lived this

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.850 
badly so many people have lived this
game<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:10.050> don't<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.440> critical

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
game and I don't want to be critical

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.589 
game and I don't want to be critical
event<00:00:11.099> Hogan<00:00:11.429> because<00:00:11.700> he<00:00:11.849> knew<00:00:12.090> what<00:00:12.330> he<00:00:12.450> was

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
event Hogan because he knew what he was

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.340 
event Hogan because he knew what he was
talking<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:14.509> what<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.809> doing<00:00:16.139> was

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
talking about and what he was doing was

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560 
talking about and what he was doing was
helping<00:00:17.220> his<00:00:17.400> game<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.000> they<00:00:18.119> he<00:00:18.240> did<00:00:18.420> not

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
helping his game so they he did not

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.470 
helping his game so they he did not
overly<00:00:18.990> hook<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> golf<00:00:19.500> ball<00:00:19.770> yet<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.699> 90%

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
overly hook the golf ball yet over 90%

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.240 
overly hook the golf ball yet over 90%
of<00:00:21.510> people<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.990> never<00:00:22.199> broken<00:00:22.439> 100<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.070> play

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
of people have never broken 100 to play

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.630 
of people have never broken 100 to play
golf<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.699> 90%<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> people<00:00:24.750> slice<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
golf in 90% of the people slice and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
golf in 90% of the people slice and
where<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> apply<00:00:27.269> pressure<00:00:27.599> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
where are we going to apply pressure in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
where are we going to apply pressure in
this<00:00:28.109> golf<00:00:28.380> swing<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this golf swing and the one thing that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.310 
this golf swing and the one thing that
you<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.330> see<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.689> every<00:00:30.900> great<00:00:31.109> player

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you will see in every great player

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.799 
you will see in every great player
there's<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> pressure<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.239> in

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
there's a lot of pressure right here in

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
there's a lot of pressure right here in
the<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.469> against<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> golf<00:00:35.489> club

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the right hand against the golf club

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
the right hand against the golf club
people<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.930> been<00:00:37.079> told<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> hold<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> lightly

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
people have been told to hold it lightly

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.240 
people have been told to hold it lightly
and<00:00:38.550> loosely<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> wrong<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.250> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and loosely and that is wrong and the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
and loosely and that is wrong and the
idea<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> power<00:00:41.969> driving<00:00:42.629> through<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
idea the power driving through here is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200 
idea the power driving through here is
being<00:00:43.530> supplied<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> strong<00:00:44.670> arm<00:00:44.940> which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
being supplied by the strong arm which

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
being supplied by the strong arm which
is<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.780> arm<00:00:46.129> we're<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.399> into<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
is the right arm we're gonna get into a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
is the right arm we're gonna get into a
couple<00:00:48.030> simple<00:00:48.239> laws<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> physics<00:00:49.140> right<00:00:49.200> now

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
couple simple laws of physics right now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.250 
couple simple laws of physics right now
and<00:00:49.910> they<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.059> very<00:00:51.449> simply<00:00:51.809> Isaac

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and they really very simply Isaac

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
and they really very simply Isaac
Newton's<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.890> law<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.399> object<00:00:53.760> in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
Newton's first law of an object in

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.930 
Newton's first law of an object in
motion<00:00:54.260> stays<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.469> motion<00:00:55.680> until<00:00:56.430> acted<00:00:56.579> upon

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
motion stays in motion until acted upon

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
motion stays in motion until acted upon
by<00:00:57.180> an<00:00:57.480> equal<00:00:57.750> great<00:00:58.020> outside<00:00:58.590> force<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> this

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
by an equal great outside force and this

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
by an equal great outside force and this
is<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> left<00:01:00.090> arm<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> tolls<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
is the left arm when it tolls now the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.130 
is the left arm when it tolls now the
club<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> stopped<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.300> another<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> his

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
club is stopped now another one of his

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.310 
club is stopped now another one of his
laws<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> reaction<00:01:06.299> which<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.020> lifting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
laws is for a reaction which I'm lifting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960 
laws is for a reaction which I'm lifting
the<00:01:07.350> club<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.280> gonna<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:08.670> equal

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the club here there's gonna be an equal

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
the club here there's gonna be an equal
and<00:01:09.060> opposite<00:01:09.450> reaction<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and opposite reaction here and in the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
and opposite reaction here and in the
golf<00:01:11.280> swing<00:01:11.369> there's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
golf swing there's a two of them one of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.270 
golf swing there's a two of them one of
them<00:01:13.049> there's<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.500> than<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.130> two

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
them there's more than that but two

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
them there's more than that but two
major<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.020> club<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> staying

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
major one and we see the club is staying

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
major one and we see the club is staying
in<00:01:16.770> motion<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.570> acting<00:01:18.960> equal<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
in motion here and it's acting equal and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
in motion here and it's acting equal and
opposite<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.369> other<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.330> forearms

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
opposite the other one is the forearms

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.370 
opposite the other one is the forearms
rotate<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> side<00:01:23.600> then<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.780> rotate<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
rotate to the side then they rotate to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
rotate to the side then they rotate to
the<00:01:25.439> other<00:01:25.530> side<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.909> big<00:01:27.210> mistake<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the other side and the big mistake that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
the other side and the big mistake that
golfers<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.470> made<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.890> years<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.549> taking

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
golfers have made for years is taking

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.640 
golfers have made for years is taking
the<00:01:30.150> medicine<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> great<00:01:31.049> players<00:01:31.320> used

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the medicine that the great players used

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
the medicine that the great players used
to<00:01:31.860> stop<00:01:32.100> hooking<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> applying<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> their

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
to stop hooking and applying it to their

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.649 
to stop hooking and applying it to their
golf<00:01:34.200> swing<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.729> pull<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
golf swing and that is to pull down in

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
golf swing and that is to pull down in
the<00:01:37.650> Gosling<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.280> feel<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:38.670> no<00:01:38.850> real

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the Gosling I feel there's no real

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.109 
the Gosling I feel there's no real
pulling<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:40.799> less<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.369> throwing

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
pulling at all more or less a throwing

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
pulling at all more or less a throwing
motion<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:42.960> arm<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.409> people<00:01:43.860> use

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
motion of the right arm that people use

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
motion of the right arm that people use
in<00:01:44.340> tennis<00:01:44.700> they've<00:01:45.149> used<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.659> bowling<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in tennis they've used it in bowling and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
in tennis they've used it in bowling and
they<00:01:46.259> used<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> baseball<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.270> we

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they used it in baseball so when we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.539 
they used it in baseball so when we
swing<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.990> look<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.009> equal<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
swing here look at all the equal and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.270 
swing here look at all the equal and
opposite<00:01:50.970> reactions<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.070> there's<00:01:53.070> an

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
opposite reactions here there's an

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
opposite reactions here there's an
action<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.180> wrists<00:01:54.450> folding<00:01:54.930> my

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
action right there my wrists folding my

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
action right there my wrists folding my
right<00:01:55.829> elbow<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.610> folding<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.630> flexion

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
right elbow is folding you see flexion

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
right elbow is folding you see flexion
at<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.380> right<00:01:58.590> shoulder<00:01:58.860> joint<00:01:59.340> when<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
at my right shoulder joint when I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
at my right shoulder joint when I
dropped<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.840> club<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> my<00:02:01.439> waist<00:02:01.680> I'm<00:02:02.490> gonna

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
dropped this club to my waist I'm gonna

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850 
dropped this club to my waist I'm gonna
react<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.899> position<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> other

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
react to the same position on the other

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
react to the same position on the other
side<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> see<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.600> elbow

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
side now you see where my right elbow

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.499 
side now you see where my right elbow
was<00:02:07.110> folded<00:02:07.560> my<00:02:07.890> left<00:02:08.160> elbow<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.330> now

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
was folded my left elbow is you see now

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.760 
was folded my left elbow is you see now
the<00:02:09.569> left<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.200> putter

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the left a putter

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.070 
the left a putter
the<00:02:11.370> shoulder<00:02:11.730> joint<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.090> folding<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.870> see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the shoulder joint is folding you see

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.470 
the shoulder joint is folding you see
the<00:02:13.260> wrist<00:02:13.470> folding<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.270> there's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the wrist folding so you can see there's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.270 
the wrist folding so you can see there's
your<00:02:15.630> action<00:02:16.110> there's<00:02:16.620> your<00:02:16.800> equal<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
your action there's your equal and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
your action there's your equal and
opposite<00:02:17.670> reaction<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:19.020> demonstrate

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
opposite reaction and to demonstrate

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
opposite reaction and to demonstrate
this<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.100> did<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> other<00:02:20.520> way<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.880> pulling

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
this if you did the other way of pulling

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.600 
this if you did the other way of pulling
and<00:02:21.390> holding<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.810> angle<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.430> wouldn't<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.520> able

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and holding the angle I wouldn't be able

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.250 
and holding the angle I wouldn't be able
to<00:02:23.790> turn<00:02:23.940> around<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.360> swing<00:02:24.630> left-handed

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
to turn around and swing left-handed

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.790 
to turn around and swing left-handed
this<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.000> manner

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
this way but if we do it in this manner

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.950 
this way but if we do it in this manner
I'd<00:02:28.800> switch<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.490> hands<00:02:29.730> around<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.300> roll<00:02:30.930> over

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
I'd switch the hands around I roll over

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.220 
I'd switch the hands around I roll over
fold<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:32.210> can<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.300> see<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.600> equal<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
fold up can you see the equal and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.020 
fold up can you see the equal and
opposite<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.830> there<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.700> everybody

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
opposite in there and so everybody

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.880 
opposite in there and so everybody
thinks<00:02:36.240> science<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.900> complicated<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.710> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
thinks science is complicated but it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.940 
thinks science is complicated but it's
really<00:02:38.130> rather<00:02:38.280> simple<00:02:39.290> now<00:02:40.290> Newton's<00:02:40.680> third

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
really rather simple now Newton's third

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.510 
really rather simple now Newton's third
law<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.160> motion<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.790> an<00:02:42.000> object<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.840> motion

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
law of motion is an object in motion

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.430 
law of motion is an object in motion
that<00:02:44.520> an<00:02:45.000> object<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.570> rest<00:02:45.600> will<00:02:46.080> stay<00:02:46.110> at<00:02:46.320> rest

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that an object at rest will stay at rest

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770 
that an object at rest will stay at rest
until<00:02:46.920> acted<00:02:47.370> by<00:02:47.490> an<00:02:47.700> equal<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.060> outside<00:02:48.480> force

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
until acted by an equal or outside force

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.590 
until acted by an equal or outside force
so<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.040> golf<00:02:50.250> swing<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.000> you're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
so if you get in a golf swing and you're

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.800 
so if you get in a golf swing and you're
relaxing<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.610> how<00:02:53.700> my<00:02:53.910> forearms<00:02:54.570> are

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
relaxing can you see how my forearms are

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.830 
relaxing can you see how my forearms are
staying<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.410> motion<00:02:55.620> my<00:02:56.580> hands<00:02:56.910> are<00:02:57.210> rotating

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
staying in motion my hands are rotating

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.890 
staying in motion my hands are rotating
because<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> forearms<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
because of the forearms and then what I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960 
because of the forearms and then what I
do<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.230> screw<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.950> hit<00:03:02.070> slices<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
do to screw it up and hit slices is I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.990 
do to screw it up and hit slices is I
left<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.050> left<00:03:04.320> hand<00:03:04.650> become<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> object<00:03:05.850> in

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
left the left hand become the object in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.630 
left the left hand become the object in
motion<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:07.050> even<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.010> camera<00:03:08.310> can

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
motion and now even in the camera can

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.030 
motion and now even in the camera can
you<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> clubface<00:03:09.540> there<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.050> want<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
you see the clubface there I want the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.770 
you see the clubface there I want the
ball<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.280> see<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.730> clubface<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.480> going

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
ball to see the clubface is going

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.990 
ball to see the clubface is going
straight<00:03:13.080> at<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.320> target

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
straight at the target

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.510 
straight at the target
so<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.810> bad<00:03:16.050> thing<00:03:16.220> creates<00:03:17.220> another

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
so one bad thing creates another

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.940 
so one bad thing creates another
situation<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:19.050> when<00:03:19.410> my<00:03:19.560> arms<00:03:19.830> are

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
situation right now when my arms are

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.070 
situation right now when my arms are
rotating<00:03:20.490> can<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.330> club<00:03:21.600> head<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
rotating can you see the club head and

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.130 
rotating can you see the club head and
the<00:03:22.440> club<00:03:22.650> face<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.280> motion<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.140> turn

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the club face are in motion I turn

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.840 
the club face are in motion I turn
around<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.620> pull<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> left<00:03:26.250> hand<00:03:26.520> let<00:03:26.700> it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
around I pull the left hand let it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.120 
around I pull the left hand let it
become<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.330> object<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.840> motion<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:28.920> all<00:03:29.100> of

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
become the object in motion then all of

for<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:28.910> many<00:04:29.060> years<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.110> get<00:04:30.380> here<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
for so many years is you get here and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.460 
for so many years is you get here and
you<00:04:30.680> pull<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.100> club<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.700> hold<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> angle

you pull the club in and hold the angle

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.560 
you pull the club in and hold the angle
that<00:04:33.470> totally<00:04:33.980> contradicts<00:04:34.670> for<00:04:35.240> every

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.220 
action there's an equal and opposite
reaction<00:04:36.980> because<00:04:37.940> when<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.240> pull<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.810> can

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
reaction because when you pull I can
