00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
when I decided to do this for a week I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
when I decided to do this for a week I
thought<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.619> easy<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
thought it was gonna be so easy then I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.889 
thought it was gonna be so easy then I
actually<00:01:50.700> went<00:01:50.970> over<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> Zoe's<00:01:51.509> room<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> go

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
actually went over to Zoe's room to go

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
actually went over to Zoe's room to go
pay<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.110> nails<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.130> chickened<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.670> just

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
pay my nails and I chickened out just

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780 
pay my nails and I chickened out just
because<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.009> want<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> do

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because I was like I don't want to do

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
because I was like I don't want to do
that<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.689> weird<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.590> whole

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that because that's weird the whole

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.200 
that because that's weird the whole
point<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> should<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.149> be

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
point of this is that it should not be

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
point of this is that it should not be
weird<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.320> guy<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> paint<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:01.860> nails

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
weird for a guy to paint their nails

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.429 
weird for a guy to paint their nails
because<00:02:02.340> where<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> written<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.780> only

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
because where is it written that only

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.520 
because where is it written that only
females<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.310> pay

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
females can pay

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.990 
females can pay
our<00:02:05.560> nails<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.190> if<00:02:06.310> males<00:02:06.580> made<00:02:06.820> their

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
our nails and that if males made their

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.669 
our nails and that if males made their
nails<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.720> makes<00:02:07.900> them<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.259> feminine

really been what I expected honestly I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.930 
really been what I expected honestly I
think<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.260> big<00:03:08.500> reason<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.459> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
think a big reason that it's so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.100 
think a big reason that it's so
different<00:03:10.209> from<00:03:10.420> what<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.600> expected<00:03:10.630> is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
different from what I expected is

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.560 
different from what I expected is
