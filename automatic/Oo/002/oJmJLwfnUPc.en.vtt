 seven years pastry for dumplings today 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 we will prepare a very simple recipe 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.740
 we need flour we will cook the euro 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.390

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.590

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.010

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.780
 look mean i take the serum it 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 what we did 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 from the fact that we threw the cottage cheese still need 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.199
 there will be flour 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.600
 a little salt and a little bit means 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.609
 pierced here if you have cups 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.420
 whey two cups of flour for kneading 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:05.230
 I pour here half my time 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.050
 salt and salt 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.600
 sugar even if you do not dumplings 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.920
 sweet salty anyway sugar 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 little is needed to add 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.690
 so she will be well more such elastic 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.920
 so I look to heat it up a little 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.170
 just gone 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.610
 salt with sugar just heating up on the stove 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.750
 Now she warms up a little and I will 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.230
 you can mix in there 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.300
 knead the dough 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.210
 sure as soon as we knead the dough 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.060
 it is necessary that she still stood somewhere on the floor 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 an hour came to the station but it is more 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 elastic 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:59.179
 yes salt will dissolve here a little bit 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.270
 heated and serum that is here 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.460
 sugar and salt dissolved all will now 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.670
 slowly introduce flour and I will 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.239
 knead neatly 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:18.680
 dough for dumplings flour necessarily 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.840
 sift such lumps 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.170
 it is enriched with oxygen so 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.750
 it turns out more figure elastic more 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.849
 dough on it while you have a lot 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 we use our flat liquids 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:36.430
