00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and antioxidants in fruits and vegetables 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.379
 natural and effective there are vitamins 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.929
 antioxidants like the cei 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 present in almost all fruits and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.960
 vegetables but if we add that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 fruits and vegetables also contain 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 phenolic compounds and carotenoids that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 they are powerful antioxidants is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 understandable that fruits and vegetables 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.529
 be essential in any diet 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.470
 there are thousands of phenolic compounds and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.950
 estimate that each plant each fruit each 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.980
 vegetable has its own set of 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 antioxidants turn each type of 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 antioxidants protects against a certain 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.420
 type of molecular damage salad 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
 fruits therefore the recommendation is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 consume lots of vegetables and fruits 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.410
 different because no fruit or 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 vegetable offers all the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 types of antioxidants that should contribute 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
 a varied diet although there are foods 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.840
 that may contain the four types of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.150
 antioxidants that are vitamins c 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.760
 and minerals like selenium or 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 zinc carotenoids and polyphenols 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.700
 the family that form the latter 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.860
 carotenoids and polyphenols is so broad 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.900
 that the best way to ensure your 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.050
 intake and protect our health is 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.270
 consume many different vegetables a 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.240
 method by which we can be guided is that of 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.550
 combine colors the color is the way 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.760
 faster and easier to recognize if a 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.509
 vegetable is rich in antioxidants to more 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.490
 color plus antioxidants polyphenols 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.710
 abound in colorful vegetables 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 live in the range that goes from yellow to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.009
 dark red and are usually found 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.990
 in the skin and skin of fruits 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.600
 possibly among the best known is 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 find anthocyanins flavones 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 and resveratrol may interest you 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.060
 mineral properties and vitamins of the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.550
 most consumed fruits grapes drops of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.190
 health to orange bunches the cocktail 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.320
 perfect of mineral vitamins and 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.940
 antioxidants properties of juices 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.800
 of fruits 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.350
 better smoke than nectar a study 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 reveals that not all individuals 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.470
 they absorb resveratrol so 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.020
 similar the anthocyanins are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.240
 responsible for the blue red color and 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.690
 violaceous red fruits like 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.910
 cherries, blackberries or currants 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.070
 Flavones are responsible for providing color 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.900
 yellow to all the fruits in which 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 they are present as lemon or 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.090
 banana resveratrol is mostly 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.190
 present in the skin and in the nuggets of 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.220
 the black grape and therefore in the wine 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.340
 red the color also indicates the type of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.620
 antioxidant in each food 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.860
 the carotenoids show colors between 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.080
 red and green orange three colors that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.990
 we can find at the same time in the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.160
 peppers when they are moving from the green 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.710
 red but possibly carrots 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.780
 pumpkins and of course in the oranges 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.870
 be the best examples of 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.210
 carotenoids within this family of 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.820
 antioxidants found lycopene 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.310
 that colors tomatoes and watermelons and the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.660
 chlorophyll that gives green color to 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.930
 spinach 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.420
 lettuce etc. selgas color is a 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.630
 quick and easy way to recognize if a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.560
 vegetable is rich in antioxidants to more 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.410
 color plus antioxidants for example those 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.360
 buds that is to say the inner leaves and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.570
 Lighter colored vegetables 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.720
 they have less antioxidants than leaves 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.510
 darker exteriors and that normally 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.330
 the dark leaves of the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.270
 romaine lettuce contain almost ten times 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.820
 more lutein an antioxidant that forms 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.280
 part of the carotenoids and that favors 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.670
 especially to the eyes that leaves 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.600
 whites of iceberg lettuce 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.300
 water-soluble antioxidants and 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.280
 fat-soluble water-soluble ones like 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.990
 vitamin c of the orange juice is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.660
 they take good advantage because the food 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.110
 contains a large amount of water in the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.660
 that antioxidants can be dissolved 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.360
 however the vitamins and and the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.150
 Carotenoids are fat-soluble and no longer 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.730
 that are accompanied by oil are lost the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.709
 lycopene from the watermelon in the picture 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.620
 take better advantage of salad with 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.319
 oil the same happens with the tomato or 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.349
 with the polyphenols carrots and 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.479
 carotenoids among the most antioxidants 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.819
 natural and effective the last 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.949
 investigations seem to prove that 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.380
 antioxidants can nullify 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.720
 damaging effects of radicals 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.120
 free in cells and people with a 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.840
 diet of fruits and vegetables rich in 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.120
 polyphenols anthocyanins fla bones and 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.669
 carotenoids have a lower risk 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.520
 of getting cancer diseases 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.910
 Heart diseases delay aging and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.889
 avoid some neurological diseases 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.080
 these investigations suggest that 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.940
 compounds such as lutein could 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.310
 prevent diseases such as 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.860
 macular degeneration and diseases 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.580
 neurodegenerative diseases caused by 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.220
 oxidative stress however despite the 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.099
 clear role of oxidative stress in 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.990
 cardiovascular diseases studies 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.630
 controlled using vitamins 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.180
 antioxidants have not shown any 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.190
 clear reduction in progress or risk 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.650
 of contracting cardinal diseases 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.070
 home this suggests that other substances 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.630
 in fruits and vegetables 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.970
 possibly the flavonoids so 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.520
 least explain partially the best 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.600
 cardiovascular health of those who consume 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.600
 more fruits and vegetables
