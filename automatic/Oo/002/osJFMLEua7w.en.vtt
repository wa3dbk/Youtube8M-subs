00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
boyfriend again and I'm trying to piece

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.410 
boyfriend again and I'm trying to piece
together<00:00:56.039> their<00:00:56.460> lives<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.239> don't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
together their lives because they don't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
together their lives because they don't
have<00:00:57.570> any<00:00:57.719> memory<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.590> fast<00:00:58.949> pace

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
have any memory of it very fast pace

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
have any memory of it very fast pace
it's<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> dystopian<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> guess<00:01:01.739> because

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it's kind of a dystopian I guess because

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759 
it's kind of a dystopian I guess because
suicide<00:01:02.850> isn't<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.420> an<00:01:03.570> epidemic<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
suicide isn't actually an epidemic but I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
suicide isn't actually an epidemic but I
definitely<00:01:05.400> recommend<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
definitely recommend there's also the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.780 
definitely recommend there's also the
sequel<00:01:07.260> called<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> treatment<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
sequel called the treatment which is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
sequel called the treatment which is
about<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> aftermath<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> program

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
about the aftermath of the program

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
about the aftermath of the program
obviously<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.310> how<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.909> recover<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
obviously and how they recover from it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
obviously and how they recover from it
this<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.790> better<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
this one is just as good if not better I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359
