00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.149 
because as we've seen Sasha has had red
hair<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.959> lot<00:02:10.289> over<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> past<00:02:10.950> year<00:02:11.430> or<00:02:11.459> so

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
hair a lot over the past year or so

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.720 
hair a lot over the past year or so
and<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.370> front<00:02:14.640> she<00:02:14.969> has<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:16.040> purple<00:02:17.040> streaks<00:02:17.459> on

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and in front she has a purple streaks on

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.890 
and in front she has a purple streaks on
each<00:02:18.030> side<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.269> serene<00:02:21.569> as<00:02:21.719> well

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
each side and that is serene as well

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
each side and that is serene as well
because<00:02:22.139> we<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.379> mga<00:02:22.739> sometimes<00:02:23.249> likes<00:02:23.519> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
because we know mga sometimes likes to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.179 
because we know mga sometimes likes to
give<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.939> nylon<00:02:24.450> streaks<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.859> Saran

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
give the nylon streaks but it is Saran

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.009 
give the nylon streaks but it is Saran
and<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.780> way<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.049> styled<00:02:28.499> has<00:02:29.870> pieces<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
and the way it's styled has pieces is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.770 
and the way it's styled has pieces is
pulled<00:02:31.379> back<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.920> twisted<00:02:32.540> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.629> like<00:02:33.750> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
pulled back and twisted kind of like a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.899 
pulled back and twisted kind of like a
throwback<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.469> feather<00:02:34.889> ages<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.700> loop

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
throwback to feather ages with the loop

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.690 
throwback to feather ages with the loop

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.680 
as a mermaid
and<00:04:38.530> now<00:04:38.830> here's<00:04:39.160> Sasha's<00:04:39.669> look<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.540> she

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
and now here's Sasha's look when she

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.120

goes from mermaid to real Bratz

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.480

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
so you just flip her end of her fin

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.550 
so you just flip her end of her fin
around<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.030> becomes<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.990> really<00:04:50.260> pretty
