00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.850
 party 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.819
 hello let's talk about how much of that a portion 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.959
 many of us have heard that the amount of the portion the potato determined 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.429
 taking our stature of our weight from our acts 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.050
 the pressure was to push to control a nutritionist if on Mars it seems that 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.890
 at that time the only thing we have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.949
 let's start with carbohydrate or marine carbohydrate servings 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.440
 examples of a serving would be half a cup of spalletti as well a serving 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.230
 one drink nothing bread so another portion 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 a third cup of gallo pinto would count as another portion usually 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 a diet can have seven servings of cat meat up to 10 servings of 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 highway 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.920
 in the case of the fleet it is always recommended to consume at least three 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 daily servings a small fruit has a portion of a party 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 large account how two portions if it were a game must be a ship not 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.650
 have your face and senate and the portion is average goes through a fruit 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.850
 the vegetables are recommended to be of free consumption that is to say that the portions 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 in unlimited as long as they are not affectionate so that it costs for a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 portion should be a paste of raw vegetables puts the vegetable pasta kos the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.320
 cooked but I repeat unlimited would be much better 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.030
 in the case of dairy products, these must be low-fat cremated entities and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.060
 always recommends around 3% a portion of a glass of milk another 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 question would be a cup of low-fat yogurt and another question would be a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 ounce that these preferably cheese under Indian 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 with proteins the proteins of the group of streets is going to end up 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.760
 ounce purchases as I say will depend on the mec and limited caloric 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.750
 that person 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.580
 a three-ounce serving is equivalent to a woman's full hand if it is a 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.630
 thin court if it were a barracks or that would be the palm of the woman's hand 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.790
 which would be the presumed protein 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.450
 a game is an ounce of protein using submachine guns have six ounces to a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.670
 a little more 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.769
 and in the case of fats 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.179
 is going to end up by spoonfuls and by teaspoons 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.929
 fats are usually four daily five daily depending on the 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.869
 caloric requirement that person would be a teaspoon of oil 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.659
 olive a fat a spoonful of mark and meridiana fair other ideas 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.680
 I tried to take a balanced diet that included lots of all the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.969
 groups and I remind you after pressures are going to be determined by a 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.329
 nutritionist thank you very much and see you next week 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.329
