00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
most unique thing about the high temp

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.450 
most unique thing about the high temp
jacket<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.649> ability<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.130> get<00:01:30.280> more

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
jacket is the ability to get more

jacket is the ability to get more
seasons<00:01:30.909> out<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.420> what's<00:01:32.200> great<00:01:32.320> about<00:01:32.439> that

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
seasons out and what's great about that

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.310 
seasons out and what's great about that
is<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.780> also<00:01:35.109> uses<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.950> same<00:01:36.189> fieldsheer
