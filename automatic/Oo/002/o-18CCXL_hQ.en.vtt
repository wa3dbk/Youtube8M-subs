I've had several hatches of chickens

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.809 
I've had several hatches of chickens
born<00:03:51.269> actually<00:03:52.230> within<00:03:52.949> plants<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.699> the

garden in the past and unfortunately or

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.699 
garden in the past and unfortunately or
fortunately<00:03:57.329> we<00:03:57.569> have<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.989> family<00:03:58.650> of

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
fortunately we have a family of

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.309 
fortunately we have a family of
hedgehogs<00:03:59.159> in<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.419> hedgehogs<00:04:00.959> doing

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
hedgehogs in there and hedgehogs doing

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.349 
hedgehogs in there and hedgehogs doing
eggs<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.829> they<00:04:01.919> do<00:04:01.979> eat<00:04:02.310> baby<00:04:02.669> chicks<00:04:02.699> so<00:04:03.180> it's

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
eggs and they do eat baby chicks so it's

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.550 
eggs and they do eat baby chicks so it's
not<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:03.780> safe<00:04:04.019> anymore

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
not really safe anymore

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.949 
not really safe anymore
once<00:04:05.280> they've<00:04:05.519> hatched<00:04:05.760> before<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.750> hatch

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959

once they've hatched before the hatch
when<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.290> hen<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.560> sitting<00:04:07.919> she's<00:04:08.129> always

when the hen is sitting she's always

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.789 
when the hen is sitting she's always
very<00:04:08.549> very<00:04:09.090> quiet<00:04:09.449> so<00:04:09.810> you've<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.109> no<00:04:10.349> problem

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
very very quiet so you've got no problem

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.319 
very very quiet so you've got no problem
with<00:04:10.829> predators<00:04:11.129> finding<00:04:11.790> them<00:04:11.909> but

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
with predators finding them but

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.479 
with predators finding them but
unfortunately<00:04:12.479> as<00:04:13.470> soon<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:13.829> they<00:04:13.949> hatch<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
unfortunately as soon as they hatch the

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.920 
unfortunately as soon as they hatch the
chicks<00:04:14.519> are<00:04:14.879> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.090> start<00:04:15.359> clamoring<00:04:15.780> for

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
chicks are going to start clamoring for

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.870 
chicks are going to start clamoring for
food<00:04:16.199> they<00:04:16.799> make<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.010> lot<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.280> noise<00:04:17.519> when<00:04:17.729> they

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
food they make a lot of noise when they

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.009 
food they make a lot of noise when they
do<00:04:17.940> hatch<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.349> this<00:04:19.590> attracts<00:04:20.250> predators<00:04:21.019> so

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
do hatch so this attracts predators so

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.370 
do hatch so this attracts predators so
that's<00:04:22.470> why<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:22.949> moved<00:04:23.159> her<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:24.210> any<00:04:24.389> way<00:04:24.479> she's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
that's why we moved her in any way she's

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.960 
that's why we moved her in any way she's
too<00:04:25.590> high<00:04:25.830> up<00:04:26.010> for<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.280> chick<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.639> get<00:04:26.789> out

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
too high up for that chick to get out

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.370 
too high up for that chick to get out
I've<00:04:27.120> had<00:04:27.300> them<00:04:27.449> worse<00:04:27.720> than<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.020> I've<00:04:28.199> had

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
I've had them worse than that I've had

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.529 
I've had them worse than that I've had
hands<00:04:28.710> actually<00:04:28.919> build<00:04:29.789> nests<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.360> wall

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
hands actually build nests on the wall

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.129 
hands actually build nests on the wall
plate<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.229> then<00:04:31.860> her<00:04:32.039> chicks<00:04:32.460> way<00:04:33.030> up<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.599> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
plate and then her chicks way up in the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.170 
plate and then her chicks way up in the
roof<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:35.039> we've<00:04:35.159> had<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.400> get<00:04:35.520> them<00:04:35.699> down<00:04:35.849> one

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
roof and we've had to get them down one

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.110 
roof and we've had to get them down one
by<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.570> by<00:04:36.720> ladder<00:04:37.020> but<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:38.760> wasn't<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
by one by ladder but this wasn't the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.340 
by one by ladder but this wasn't the
case<00:04:39.300> here<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.690> was<00:04:39.840> pretty

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
case here this was pretty

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.800 
case here this was pretty
yes<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.680> thought<00:04:40.920> considering<00:04:41.880> chuckles<00:04:42.420> isn't

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
yes I thought considering chuckles isn't

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.500 
yes I thought considering chuckles isn't
that<00:04:43.020> time<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.830> thought<00:04:44.670> this<00:04:44.760> was<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:44.970> very

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
that time I thought this was a very

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.130 
that time I thought this was a very
simple<00:04:46.230> job

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
simple job

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.160 
simple job
and<00:04:49.190> shortly<00:04:50.210> I'll<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.420> put<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> little<00:04:51.720> food
