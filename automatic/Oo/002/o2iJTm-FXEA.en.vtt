00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Good afternoon, dear submarine hunters 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.580
 in this video plot we will talk 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 in the bar blute for spearfishing omer 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.040
 cayman 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:18.020
 hf from the name we see that hf is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.670
 the abbreviation of hydra forms i.e. trunk 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 crossbows made the wrong form 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.060
 using hydra pharming technology 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 what is the table the wrong shape is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.300
 when the barrel is not ordinary cylindrical 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 full length 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 with a diameter of 28 millimeters and starts from 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 cylinder 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.350
 he expands swells in some 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.719
 moment to maximum and again narrowing 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:51.539
 tapers towards the head of the crossbow that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 gives us such a wrong formation 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.949
 trunks first we increase the stiffness 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.789
 the trunk did not increase its weight 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:06.689
 second we can carry the barrel into any 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.729
 shape depending on the length of the crossbow when 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.140
 this shift the center of buoyancy 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.409
 shift the center get we can 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.509
 balance your hand and we don't have to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.159
 put extra effort into 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.990
 keep in court for a long time 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.900
 the third advantage has become wrong 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 Forms on a trunk it turns out flat 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.920
 streamlined and when turning with a crossbow 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
 support 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450
 water will do us the least 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.350
 resistance 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.299
 thanks to which we can faster 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.090
 respond to a sudden appearance 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:49.189
 fish and make an accurate shot further 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 consider the handle of the crossbow we see 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.090
 metal whether or not reset which 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.899
 is in the side field with a crossbow 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 thanks to this, we have but a frosted 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.920
 will be along the x axis was 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 and thereby will cause 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 no additional sail 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.090
 interfere with the coil or lantern 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.060
 or something else further 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.580
 handle on made in white light 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.790
 finger on the trigger is on 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.600
 one axis with the barrel thanks to this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 the hand will bear recoil which will 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.370
 to proceed with the shotgun 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.870
 the tops were 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.840
 we see a specially trough guides in 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.790
 which fit in garpun rivne 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 table so that when bending 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.980
 harpoon drags they pull it not bend 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.340
 it will be served the smallest and 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.830
 bending thereby unbending will not 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.610
 vibrate and will not be degraded about it 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.780
 initially 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.410
 departure trajectory the head part has 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.750
 two holes for annular strands in 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.450
 We have one thick traction set 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.820
 but if we want to easily charge a crossbow 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.170
 we can install two more thin 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.760
 thrust for example with a diameter of 14 millimeters 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:37.739
 hook crossbow have hinged 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.690
 metal further strongly pay 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.480
 focus on style 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.549
 some packages are packaged from 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.790
 depending on the party to the party and on 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.470
 length root arrows 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 some tickets are completed raw 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.910
 Depending on the arrows here that which you 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.440
 the arrow needs to be specified in the store 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.930
 asks which one from the rear 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.530
 installed on a particular crossbow 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.130
 which is offered to you also in 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.320
 set to crossbow extra 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.900
 emphasis and specially lead weights that 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.580
 we are given these flat lead weights in 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.080
 ideally 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.260
 crossbow must be balanced so 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.680
 to keep his head down a little 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.200
 a little not super effort if even so little 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.710
 slightly tending down will not be then when 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.230
 head shot will tamp the arrow and 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.040
 thereby disrupting its flight path 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.230
 worsen the accuracy why are we different 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.150
 weights they one boot depending 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.600
 from the thickness of the dumb that we will 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.240
 to put 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.450
 and we can put an arrow and a diameter of 6 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.390
 millimeters to diameter there 8 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.990
 millimeters here we have to balance 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.010
 depending on your set-ups and 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.210
 arrows 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:06.430
 our add weight that's all 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.470
 I recommend a crossbow source with experience 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.730
 it is more than average and above average 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.700
 level also crossbow drops in pancakes 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.580
 from seventy five to one hundred thirty 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.580
 centimeters all the best bye
