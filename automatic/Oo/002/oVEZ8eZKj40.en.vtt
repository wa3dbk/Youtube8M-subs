on<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> road<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> yeah<00:01:26.610> what's<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on the road in that yeah what's the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
on the road in that yeah what's the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
think it's the fact that you put your

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.530 
think it's the fact that you put your
body<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.700> often<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> you
