00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay this right here is a part the rody

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.769 
okay this right here is a part the rody
rotary<00:00:04.799> plow<00:00:05.040> there's<00:00:05.970> lots<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> videos<00:00:06.600> of

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
rotary plow there's lots of videos of

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.509 
rotary plow there's lots of videos of
these<00:00:06.899> things<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.290> operation<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.220> few

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
these things in operation and a few

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.169 
these things in operation and a few
reviews<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.360> them<00:00:10.429> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.670> more<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
reviews of them this is more of a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.970 
reviews of them this is more of a
modification<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.110> I've<00:00:13.200> done<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> mind<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
modification that I've done to mind that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.169 
modification that I've done to mind that
you<00:00:14.070> might<00:00:14.219> want<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> consider<00:00:14.759> if<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.120> have

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
you might want to consider if you have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.689 
you might want to consider if you have
rocky<00:00:15.480> soil<00:00:15.839> around<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:17.130> there's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> lot<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
rocky soil around here there's a lot of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.910 
rocky soil around here there's a lot of
rocks<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.150> lot<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.359> rocks<00:00:18.510> about<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> size<00:00:19.140> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
rocks a lot of rocks about this size so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
rocks a lot of rocks about this size so
potato<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.330> about<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.750> right

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
potato but it's it's about the right

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.210 
potato but it's it's about the right
size<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.210> problems<00:00:24.750> with

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
size that this can have problems with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.550 
size that this can have problems with
and<00:00:26.220> I'll<00:00:26.340> show<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.580> why<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.439> look

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and I'll show you why so if you look

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.939 
and I'll show you why so if you look
down<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:29.539> there's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.750> plate<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.560> bolted

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
down here there's a plate that's bolted

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
down here there's a plate that's bolted
across<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> structure<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> plow<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
across the structure of the plow and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190 
across the structure of the plow and
then<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> shearing<00:00:35.820> member<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.989> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
then there's a shearing member that as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
then there's a shearing member that as
it<00:00:37.380> comes<00:00:37.620> around<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.520> chopped<00:00:38.820> up

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it comes around it kind of chopped up

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
it comes around it kind of chopped up
grass<00:00:42.320> not<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> chop<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.640> roots<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
grass not going to chop up the roots and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
grass not going to chop up the roots and
went<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> grass<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.440> big

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
went out of the grass so it's not a big

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
went out of the grass so it's not a big
chunk<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.160> grass<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:48.210> assuming<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.350> anyway

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
chunk of grass I'm assuming but anyway

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.330 
chunk of grass I'm assuming but anyway
behind<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.640> plate<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.570> cavity<00:00:52.340> between

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
behind this plate is a cavity between

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.590 
behind this plate is a cavity between
the<00:00:53.899> shaft<00:00:54.899> body<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> shearing<00:00:57.270> pipe

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the shaft body and and the shearing pipe

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.770 
the shaft body and and the shearing pipe
and<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> look<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.590> closely<00:00:59.780> right

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and if you look down here closely right

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
and if you look down here closely right
now<00:01:00.960> I've<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.789> modification<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
now I've got a I got my modification on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.190 
now I've got a I got my modification on
so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> RC<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.040> two<00:01:05.250> bolts<00:01:05.990> hold<00:01:06.990> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
so it's a RC but these two bolts hold on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
so it's a RC but these two bolts hold on
a<00:01:07.560> piece<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> angle<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.909> I've<00:01:09.090> found<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
a piece of angle that I've found it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
a piece of angle that I've found it
grant<00:01:10.740> ground<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:12.360> match<00:01:12.710> where<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> cavity

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
grant ground to match where the cavity

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
grant ground to match where the cavity
was<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.119> close<00:01:15.740> you'll<00:01:16.740> see

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
was so if you come down close you'll see

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.520 
was so if you come down close you'll see
that<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.780> still<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.890 

UPC<00:01:22.530> code<00:01:22.890> label<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
UPC code label on them so it's right

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
UPC code label on them so it's right
there<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> piece<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> metal<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.759> in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
there that's the piece of metal I put in

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.780 
there that's the piece of metal I put in
and<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> bolts<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and it bolts right to the back of this

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
and it bolts right to the back of this
so<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:29.909> would<00:01:30.030> happen<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> rock<00:01:30.990> about

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
so what would happen is a rock about

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
so what would happen is a rock about
this<00:01:31.530> size<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.369> along<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this size and I'm going along also the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.539 
this size and I'm going along also the
machine<00:01:33.420> would<00:01:33.540> stop<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> come<00:01:34.500> over<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
machine would stop and come over and it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
machine would stop and come over and it
would<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.110> found

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
would be up in here so they like found

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.969 
would be up in here so they like found
that<00:01:37.619> far<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.689> machine<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> glued

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that far so as the machine has it glued

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
that far so as the machine has it glued
glided<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.090> surface<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.140> pushed<00:01:43.439> up

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
glided up this surface and get pushed up

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.100 
glided up this surface and get pushed up
in<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> new<00:01:44.850> wood<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.840> this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
in here in the new wood and then this

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.630 
in here in the new wood and then this
will<00:01:46.409> try<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.590> chop<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.520> try

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
will try to chop it off which will try

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
will try to chop it off which will try
to<00:01:47.670> push<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.500> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to push it in more and it would just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
to push it in more and it would just
come<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.130> situation<00:01:50.670> where<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.210> trying<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
come to situation where it was trying to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.249 
come to situation where it was trying to
crush<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> rock<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.270> several<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.869> had

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
crush a rock and so it is several I had

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.609 
crush a rock and so it is several I had
several<00:01:55.560> instances<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:57.540> happening<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
several instances of that happening so I
