00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello ladies and gentlemen today i am 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.750
 decided to submit to your court such a tank 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.740
 KV-1 is not this tank very , very like 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.219
 I have it all played really 100 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.260
 battles 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.100
 but what 100 battles three warriors and one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 of them will now be presented to you and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.920
 so zigfried line cards i'm in top then drink 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.780
 you can’t think of three arts 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 noticed that it is worth beingware 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 inspect by country we notice that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 us siblings is type 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 t-34 is our ally 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 and they have this apt-1 too, and 3 pieces and all these 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.190
 tanks and so they bought for a stock that is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 kv-1 on it is still a 50 percent discount 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.750
 doubled yield she pieces doubled 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.530
 profitability and also some 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 discount honestly pieces 3 me specifically 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 furious because the tank where 10 and 5 pipe 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.270
 just staggering and take lead killing 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 20 but this is not such an important frag notices 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.689
 t28 I think now I will take preemptive ladies 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 damage here and fig folded t28 think 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.200
 now for certain their harp comes to life the whole 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.100
 damage and I think that catch is not here anymore 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.790
 nothing need to go to town in town i 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.759
 I think will meet with square-1 and there would have 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.759
 sentsa who's me then 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.090
 tanks worth stereo tube since the review is in 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.250
 top of the tower just 310 meters you can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 consider it not a review so shine who 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 next to come with a stereo tube quite so 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.549
 nothing ok 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 don't feel so hurt too 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.690
 the place is the ventilation circle all 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.360
 increase ivlin and range of the review and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.080
 recharge a bit and to increase and 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.300
 Charging separately I took the rammer very 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:26.380
 very useful thing for me now i 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:29.630
 Jour and leaving 38 to take my shooting and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.280
 it is not clear where it goes from the tobacco he wants 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.140
 drive off shooting ignite him think okay 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.050
 I think the man himself yes the candle is on 28 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 soot come down but unfortunately it is from us 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.890

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.930
 but who can not leave us not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.209
 looking at his super mobility speed 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 unfortunately this briton has speed 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.110
 there is and not lose there he does not shine 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.130

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.380
 second time and 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.750
 one briton is no longer in our world 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.450

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.450
