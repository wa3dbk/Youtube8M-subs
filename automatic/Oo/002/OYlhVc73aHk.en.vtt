not<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:58.220> apparently<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.640> unlock

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
not so apparently they have to unlock

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.860 
not so apparently they have to unlock
somehow<00:03:00.450> or<00:03:00.750> lock<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.970> something<00:03:05.690> what<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
somehow or lock or something what that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.610 
somehow or lock or something what that
something<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.470> couldn't<00:03:07.620> tell<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:09.620> do

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
something is I couldn't tell you I do

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.440 
something is I couldn't tell you I do
know<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.920> when<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.310> game<00:03:11.489> came<00:03:11.549> out<00:03:13.400> I

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
know that when this game came out I

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.030 
know that when this game came out I
never<00:03:15.450> played<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.019> didn't<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.769> anybody

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
never played it I didn't know anybody

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.620 
never played it I didn't know anybody
that<00:03:17.370> had<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:19.230> existed<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:23.299> nobody<00:03:24.299> had<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
that had it existed but nobody had it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.979 
that had it existed but nobody had it
and<00:03:25.910> that's<00:03:26.910> probably<00:03:27.239> because<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.870> was<00:03:27.900> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and that's probably because it was a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.050 
and that's probably because it was a
scary<00:03:28.260> concept<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.920> 82<00:03:31.640> computer<00:03:32.640> programs

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
scary concept in 82 computer programs

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780 
scary concept in 82 computer programs
were<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:35.010> new<00:03:35.220> thing<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
were just a new thing to the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.650 
were just a new thing to the
non-professional<00:03:39.350> your<00:03:40.350> average<00:03:40.890> Joe<00:03:41.660> really

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
non-professional your average Joe really

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.599 
non-professional your average Joe really
didn't<00:03:42.930> understand<00:03:43.350> how<00:03:43.470> they<00:03:43.620> worked<00:03:44.630> and

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
didn't understand how they worked and

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.559 
didn't understand how they worked and
subsequently<00:03:49.760> concept<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:50.910> far<00:03:51.239> enough<00:03:51.329> that

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
subsequently concept was far enough that

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.199 
subsequently concept was far enough that
you<00:03:51.870> could<00:03:51.989> make<00:03:52.170> an<00:03:52.260> entire<00:03:52.380> movie<00:03:52.859> about

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
you could make an entire movie about

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.020 
you could make an entire movie about
digitizing<00:03:54.209> something<00:03:54.720> which<00:03:54.900> meant<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
digitizing something which meant that it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.140 
digitizing something which meant that it
actually<00:03:57.239> physically<00:03:57.840> went<00:03:58.079> into

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
actually physically went into

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.699 
actually physically went into
a<00:03:59.500> computer<00:04:00.500> circuit<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:03.140> concept<00:04:03.560> is

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
a computer circuit the concept is

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.580 
a computer circuit the concept is
ridiculous<00:04:04.220> by<00:04:04.400> today's<00:04:04.670> standards<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.590> so

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
ridiculous by today's standards but so

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.229 
ridiculous by today's standards but so
little<00:04:06.769> was<00:04:07.010> known<00:04:07.250> by<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.519> layperson<00:04:08.060> about

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
little was known by the layperson about

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:17.170 
little was known by the layperson about
computers<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:10.220> seemed<00:04:10.900> plausible<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:16.180> imagine

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
computers it seemed plausible I imagine

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.099 
computers it seemed plausible I imagine
it's<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:18.370> much<00:04:19.370> like<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:20.509> surprise<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
it's a much like the surprise of the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.730 
it's a much like the surprise of the
indigenous<00:04:21.410> people<00:04:22.660> where<00:04:23.660> they<00:04:23.810> met<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.229> the
