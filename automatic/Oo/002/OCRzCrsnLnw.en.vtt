that<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.350> tracing<00:01:41.710> paper<00:01:41.740> stays<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.730> between

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.650 

you<00:02:00.220> should<00:02:00.400> end<00:02:00.550> up<00:02:00.730> with<00:02:00.790> something<00:02:01.540> looking

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
you should end up with something looking

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:16.380 
you should end up with something looking
a<00:02:01.870> bit<00:02:02.020> like<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:15.340> next<00:02:15.790> step<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.210> to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
a bit like this the next step is to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.540 
a bit like this the next step is to
reassemble<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.110> frame<00:02:17.380> around<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:18.010> glass<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
reassemble the frame around the glass to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:27.320

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.120 

you<00:04:01.140> should<00:04:01.290> end<00:04:01.440> up<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.590> something<00:04:02.040> looking

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
you should end up with something looking

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:13.640 
you should end up with something looking
a<00:04:02.280> little<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:11.900> take<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.080> square<00:04:13.410> piece
