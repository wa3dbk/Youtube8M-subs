00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.260 
that thin bit of insulation does take
the<00:02:21.680> chill<00:02:22.040> off<00:02:22.070> although<00:02:22.550> i<00:02:22.910> will<00:02:23.240> say

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the chill off although i will say

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.540 
the chill off although i will say
without<00:02:23.990> wearing<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.680> over<00:02:25.040> base<00:02:25.280> layer

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
without wearing this over base layer

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.340 
without wearing this over base layer
while<00:02:26.000> hiking<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.990> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> work<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:29.350> was

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
while hiking is not going to work I was

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.620 
while hiking is not going to work I was
about<00:02:30.620> 35<00:02:31.160> degree<00:02:31.550> weather<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.850> wore<00:02:32.210> this<00:02:32.360> over

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
about 35 degree weather I wore this over

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.540 
about 35 degree weather I wore this over
my<00:02:32.750> base<00:02:32.960> layer<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.770> started<00:02:34.160> sweating

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
my base layer and I started sweating

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.580 
my base layer and I started sweating
pretty<00:02:34.670> bad<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.210> I<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.660> wasn't<00:02:35.990> venting

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
pretty bad and I just wasn't venting

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.670 
pretty bad and I just wasn't venting
enough<00:02:36.860> fuel<00:02:37.160> unzipped<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.750> think<00:02:39.350> that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
enough fuel unzipped and I think that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.350 
enough fuel unzipped and I think that
was<00:02:39.860> because<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.250> needed<00:02:40.760> something<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.180> was

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
was because I needed something that was

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.900 
was because I needed something that was
going<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.600> cover<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.170> wind<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.190> not<00:02:43.370> insulate

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
going to cover the wind but not insulate

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.250 
going to cover the wind but not insulate
and<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.480> has<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.870> little<00:02:45.020> bit<00:02:45.230> of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
and this has that little bit of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.200 
and this has that little bit of
insulation<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.340> keep<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.790> mind<00:02:47.030> if

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
insulation so keep that in mind if

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.840 
insulation so keep that in mind if
you're<00:02:47.330> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.630> doing<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.900> lot<00:02:47.930> of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
you're going to be doing a lot of

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.070 
you're going to be doing a lot of
strenuous<00:02:49.850> activity<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.720> you're<00:02:50.810> looking

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
strenuous activity and you're looking

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.660 
strenuous activity and you're looking
for<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> wind<00:02:51.440> shirt<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:52.070> may<00:02:52.310> not<00:02:52.460> be<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
for a wind shirt this may not be the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.420 
for a wind shirt this may not be the
best<00:02:52.970> option<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.720> another<00:02:54.590> issue<00:02:54.800> with

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
best option for you another issue with

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.000 
best option for you another issue with
this<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:56.990> little<00:02:57.290> expensive<00:02:57.470> i

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
this is that it is a little expensive i

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.070 
this is that it is a little expensive i
think<00:02:58.520> i<00:02:58.610> paid<00:02:58.790> about<00:02:58.940> 90<00:02:59.330> bucks<00:02:59.360> for<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.840> i

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
think i paid about 90 bucks for it i

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.630 
think i paid about 90 bucks for it i
think<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:00.410> around<00:03:00.500> 100<00:03:01.010> at<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.280> point<00:03:01.520> in

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
think it's around 100 at this point in

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.120 
think it's around 100 at this point in
time<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.840> are<00:03:03.020> other<00:03:03.290> wind<00:03:03.680> shirts<00:03:03.950> out

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
time there are other wind shirts out

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.770 
time there are other wind shirts out
there<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.640> are<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.790> little<00:03:05.000> bit<00:03:05.210> cheaper<00:03:05.600> that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
there that are a little bit cheaper that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.630 
there that are a little bit cheaper that
don't<00:03:06.020> have<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.260> insulation<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.550> our

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
don't have the insulation and that our

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.460 
don't have the insulation and that our
lighter<00:03:07.940> one<00:03:08.720> example<00:03:08.900> would<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
lighter one example would be the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.310 
lighter one example would be the
patagonia<00:03:10.130> Houdini<00:03:10.550> which<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.660> think<00:03:11.960> it

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
patagonia Houdini which is I think it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.410 
patagonia Houdini which is I think it
weighs<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.740> four<00:03:13.010> ounces<00:03:13.460> so<00:03:14.000> about<00:03:14.210> half

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
weighs of like four ounces so about half

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.810 
weighs of like four ounces so about half
the<00:03:14.630> weight<00:03:14.780> no<00:03:15.020> insulation<00:03:15.500> but<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:16.610> going

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
the weight no insulation but it's going

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.150 
the weight no insulation but it's going
to<00:03:16.880> perform<00:03:17.210> a<00:03:17.450> little<00:03:17.720> bit<00:03:17.840> better<00:03:17.990> on<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
to perform a little bit better on the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.640 
to perform a little bit better on the
the<00:03:19.580> aspect<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.270> wind<00:03:20.780> without<00:03:21.320> the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
the aspect for wind without the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.610 
the aspect for wind without the
insulation<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.400> rain<00:03:23.240> this<00:03:23.960> will<00:03:24.230> wet<00:03:24.470> out

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
insulation and rain this will wet out

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.710 
insulation and rain this will wet out
fairly<00:03:24.980> quick<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.610> does<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.030> little<00:03:26.240> water

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
fairly quick it does have a little water

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720 
fairly quick it does have a little water
resistant<00:03:27.320> coating<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> light<00:03:28.460> sprinkle

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
resistant coating so a light sprinkle

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.550 
resistant coating so a light sprinkle
would<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.180> alright<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.720> if<00:03:29.870> you're<00:03:30.020> getting<00:03:30.200> a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
would be alright but if you're getting a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.950 
would be alright but if you're getting a
lot<00:03:30.920> more<00:03:30.950> rain<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:32.240> is<00:03:32.390> going<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.630> let<00:03:32.840> out

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
lot more rain this is going to let out

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.270 
lot more rain this is going to let out
real<00:03:33.200> quick<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:33.770> going<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:33.980> be<00:03:34.100> cold

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
real quick and you're going to be cold

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.180 
real quick and you're going to be cold
so<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.750> my<00:03:35.930> opinion<00:03:36.050> this<00:03:36.500> would<00:03:36.740> be<00:03:36.890> one<00:03:37.070> to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
so in my opinion this would be one to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.830 
so in my opinion this would be one to
possibly<00:03:37.610> pass<00:03:37.880> up<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.330> look<00:03:38.510> at<00:03:38.630> something

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
possibly pass up and look at something

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.480 
possibly pass up and look at something
else<00:03:39.080> unless<00:03:39.680> you're<00:03:39.920> looking<00:03:40.160> for<00:03:40.310> something

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
else unless you're looking for something

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.060 
else unless you're looking for something
that<00:03:40.850> has<00:03:41.030> wind<00:03:41.360> protection<00:03:41.800> slight<00:03:42.800> bit<00:03:43.040> of

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
that has wind protection slight bit of

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.860 
that has wind protection slight bit of
insulation<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.910> you're<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.570> going<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.810> be

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
insulation and you're not going to be

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.450 
insulation and you're not going to be
doing<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:45.140> whole<00:03:45.260> lot<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.410> strenuous<00:03:45.740> activity

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
doing a whole lot of strenuous activity

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.660 
doing a whole lot of strenuous activity
then<00:03:47.060> give<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.750> Marmot<00:03:48.110> dry<00:03:48.320> climb<00:03:48.670> windshirt
