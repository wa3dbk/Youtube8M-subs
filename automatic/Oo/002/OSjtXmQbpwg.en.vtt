00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
now this game I've noticed is a little

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.110 
now this game I've noticed is a little
glitch<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.450> when<00:03:59.600> you<00:03:59.720> feed<00:04:00.050> them<00:04:00.380> they<00:04:01.120> always

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
glitch so when you feed them they always

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.000 
glitch so when you feed them they always
gain<00:04:02.360> weight<00:04:02.570> right<00:04:02.630> away<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:03.530> then<00:04:03.830> they

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
gain weight right away and then they

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:28.750 
gain weight right away and then they
don't<00:04:04.220> like<00:04:04.640> over<00:04:07.270> which<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.810> don't<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:28.430> so

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
don't like over which you don't and so

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.580 
don't like over which you don't and so
that's<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.750> end<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.440> day<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:32.690> wanna

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
that's really the end of the day I wanna

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.840 
that's really the end of the day I wanna
read<00:04:33.920> I'm<00:04:34.130> recording<00:04:34.700> for<00:04:34.940> four<00:04:35.570> minutes

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.530 

think<00:04:40.850> I'm<00:04:40.970> gonna<00:04:41.120> end<00:04:41.330> up<00:04:41.450> there<00:04:41.690> sorry
