00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.590
 of the cable and what functionalities we 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.950
 offers 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.560
 being anchored you 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.270
 as being in tablet mode 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 as you see right now it's in mode 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.410
 windows 8 uses 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.050
 screen 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.150
 initial if we want to change to mode 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.060
 Android there is a button on the screen 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.820
 we can also 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 and as you can see in a matter of a second 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.449
 access 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 28 the same as the first connector 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.560
 for the keyboard and mouse works both 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.970
 operating systems so if we want 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.460
 your health 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.300
 we seem more comfortable android with 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 keyboard and with mouse 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.260
 as you can see android is going well now 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.260
 Thank you 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.950
 the processor tegra 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.509
 which includes the truth of four cores 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.870
 when in this mode the tablet 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.450
 It is also here 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.280
 a battery that asus 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.180
 specific for five hours in the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.900
 reality 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.900
 multimedia 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.909
 and that kind of thing the battery stays 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.409
 in three and a half hours 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.810
 which is also not bad considering 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.070
 this 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.070
 on the board that are 10 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.140
 1080p high definition screens 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.550
 in format of 16 90 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.220
 if we want 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.220
 will return windows mode we press a button 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.480
 activated can be wifi 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.890
 from fernet 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.680
 the screen with which to work 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.940
 the truth 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.940
 every decade with which also 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.210
 that we want tablet mode we have here 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.690
 an eyelash 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.340
 It's just over a kilo, as you can see. 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 to enter the remote control mode 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 from windows 8 we can directly 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 use this mode configure it so that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.530
 when we take them out, make a control 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.720
 remote for windows 8 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.420
 the pce station is still running which is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.940
 base 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.050
 normal if we have some process released 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.600
 will continue to work normally 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.580
 that we want the android mode we press the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.610
 button and here we are 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 we have as you see has a pedestal in 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.780
 this area here that we can extend 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.850
 to observe to use and of course 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
 we have 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 all normal gyros modes 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.310
 we can find any other 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.160
 tablet 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.980
 we will rotate it will be put in the way that 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.630
 we have it in the insurance the base only 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.710
 is designed to be used in the country 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 something by itself 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.430
 to use it vertically you can not 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.319
 use the penalty that integral 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.630
 it looks great with the processor 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.370
 tegra 3 of 4 cores 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.770
 and the truth is not 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.390
 It is very comfortable as it is 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.680
 the accesses to the applications 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.980
 usual that asus 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.659
 on your tablets and the truth is that as 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.230
 you can see our article comes very 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:28.110
 well equipped so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.940
 we do not have to have 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.560
 the screen 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.630
 works in tactile mode whether the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.630
 we have connected to the computer as 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.980
 we go back to the world 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 pressing a single button 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.099
 28 attack 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.890
 from windows 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.780
 exactly as we wanted 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.900
 and then we also have 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.349
 software change models 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.349
 let's go here 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.729
 and let's go 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.020
 everything very fast without problems and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.340
 working like a charm 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.259
 we can have for example in our 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.680
 Android operating system works in 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.680
 all day 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.960
 a way to save energy but you can 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:43.090
 keep having our mail 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.090
 always updated information 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.760
 we said before it's still loading in this 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760
 mode 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.030
 no problem 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.030
 and hoping that we use it 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.289
 hardware and we can 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.990
 no need to change any program 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.770
 one hour special as a screen in 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.910
 any moment 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.910
 how is one of the 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.810
 all in one the market specials and 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.440
 with one of the most functionalities 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.440
 extensive 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.490
 working 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.030
 that was at the start because it is 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.720
 operated 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.720
 mechanic 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.490
 The Android remote control system 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.889
 it is a program that is associated and goes 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.160
 updating the ip as modified 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.660
 both in the pc station and in the 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.350
 totally transparent once it 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.990
 we configure we do not have to do 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.060
 just enjoy it as you see the 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.860
 tablet has several modes of saving 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.860
 energy the usual functions 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.180
 accustomed to 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.020
 transformers or any other tablet or 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.020
 asus phone 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.969
 quite the android operating system and 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.190
 its operation is usually really 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.860
 well nothing this is 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.610
 roughly he 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.550
 training 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.860
 a hybrid between 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.620
 platforms that how can you have how 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.780
 works 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.860
 complements very well both for the 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.729
 Windows platform as for the leg
