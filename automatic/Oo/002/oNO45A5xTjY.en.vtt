we're<00:00:04.050> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.350> discussing<00:00:04.710> creating<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
we're going to be discussing creating a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.630 
we're going to be discussing creating a
vignette<00:00:06.120> using<00:00:06.569> Lightroom<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:08.370> picture

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:08.640 
vignette using Lightroom the picture

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.520 
vignette using Lightroom the picture
I've<00:00:08.790> got<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.090> here<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> sample<00:00:10.020> is<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.470> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I've got on here for a sample is of a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.680 
I've got on here for a sample is of a
cat<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.280> very<00:00:11.520> bright<00:00:11.850> background<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
cat with a very bright background and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
cat with a very bright background and
that<00:00:12.810> bright<00:00:13.140> background<00:00:13.800> can<00:00:14.490> often<00:00:14.820> take

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that bright background can often take

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.720 
that bright background can often take
away<00:00:15.390> from<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> impact<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> subject

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
away from the impact of the subject

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.339 
away from the impact of the subject
matter<00:00:17.939> in<00:00:18.150> your<00:00:18.179> photograph<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> we're<00:00:19.230> going

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
matter in your photograph so we're going

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.730 
matter in your photograph so we're going
to<00:00:19.439> deal<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.679> that<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> vignette<00:00:21.740> so

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to deal with that with a vignette so

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.140 
to deal with that with a vignette so
what<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.099> is<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.339> make<00:00:23.519> sure<00:00:23.730> we're<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
what we do is we make sure we're in the

to come up against but today we're going
to<00:00:47.790> go<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.150> left<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.720> create<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> dark

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to go to the left and create a dark

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
to go to the left and create a dark
event<00:00:50.040> yet<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:50.790> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> really

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.900> overdo<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.380> just<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
going to overdo it just a little bit so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.890 
going to overdo it just a little bit so
we<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.490> really<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.750> with

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
we can really see where we're going with

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.760 
we can really see where we're going with
the<00:00:58.080> other<00:00:58.170> panels<00:00:59.040> here<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:01.290> midpoint

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the other panels here the midpoint

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.620 
the other panels here the midpoint
slider<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.580> go<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> left<00:01:03.240> you'll<00:01:03.540> see

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
slider if we go to the left you'll see

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.370 
slider if we go to the left you'll see
it<00:01:03.840> moves<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.559> midpoint<00:01:04.829> down<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.359> if<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.259> go

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it moves that midpoint down and if we go

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
it moves that midpoint down and if we go
to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> moves<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.759> creating

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to the right it moves right out creating

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.859 
to the right it moves right out creating
a<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:10.009> edgy<00:01:11.009> effect<00:01:11.399> but<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.539> what<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a very edgy effect but I think what the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
a very edgy effect but I think what the
this<00:01:13.200> photo<00:01:13.469> will<00:01:13.649> require<00:01:14.009> given<00:01:14.369> whether

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
this photo will require given whether

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.120 
this photo will require given whether
cat<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> photo<00:01:15.899> will<00:01:16.710> leave<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.039> at

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
cat has in the photo will leave it at

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
cat has in the photo will leave it at
about<00:01:17.249> here<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> roundness<00:01:20.039> just<00:01:20.939> creates<00:01:21.329> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
about here the roundness just creates a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.219 
about here the roundness just creates a
very<00:01:22.499> round<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.569> if<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
very round to the right and if we go to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.309 
very round to the right and if we go to
the<00:01:25.469> left<00:01:25.700> more<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> rectangle<00:01:27.659> type<00:01:27.899> effect

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
the left more of a rectangle type effect

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.039 
the left more of a rectangle type effect
and<00:01:29.039> again<00:01:29.399> it'll<00:01:29.819> just<00:01:30.119> change<00:01:30.389> depending<00:01:30.960> on

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and again it'll just change depending on

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
and again it'll just change depending on
what<00:01:31.289> your<00:01:31.530> taste<00:01:32.249> is<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:32.909> their<00:01:33.119> images

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
what your taste is and what their images

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.039 
what your taste is and what their images
that<00:01:34.289> you're<00:01:34.439> trying<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.889> put<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> vignette<00:01:35.490> on

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that you're trying to put a vignette on

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.139 
that you're trying to put a vignette on
the<00:01:37.049> feather<00:01:37.319> here<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> right

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
the feather here if we go to the right

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.969 
the feather here if we go to the right
we'll<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.749> very<00:01:39.960> soft<00:01:40.289> transition

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we'll make it a very soft transition

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
we'll make it a very soft transition
between<00:01:41.219> the<00:01:41.609> dark<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> light<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.719> if<00:01:43.289> we

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
between the dark and the light and if we

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
between the dark and the light and if we
go<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.770> left<00:01:43.920> you'll<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.119> hard

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
go to the left you'll see a very hard

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.899 
go to the left you'll see a very hard
transition<00:01:46.249> almost<00:01:47.249> like<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.459> picture<00:01:47.759> frame

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
transition almost like a picture frame

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
transition almost like a picture frame
and<00:01:48.359> some<00:01:48.990> people<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.069> kind

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and some people do use it for that kind

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.730 
and some people do use it for that kind
of<00:01:50.429> effect<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.200> we'll<00:01:52.319> just<00:01:52.439> make<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
of effect but I think we'll just make it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.849 
of effect but I think we'll just make it
a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:52.889> bit<00:01:53.130> softer<00:01:53.609> here<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.679> just

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
a little bit softer here and just

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.830 
a little bit softer here and just
remember<00:01:56.249> to<00:01:56.279> that<00:01:56.609> we've<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:57.630> done

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
remember to that we've got over done

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
remember to that we've got over done
with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> amount<00:01:58.499> here<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:58.859> we'll<00:01:59.009> come

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
with the amount here which we'll come

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.969 
with the amount here which we'll come
back<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.490> fix<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> moment<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:01.469> highlights

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
back and fix in a moment the highlights

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
back and fix in a moment the highlights
here<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.850> protect<00:02:03.209> some<00:02:03.389> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.569> highlights

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
here just protect some of the highlights

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.449 
here just protect some of the highlights
and<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.319> move<00:02:04.499> it<00:02:04.679> to<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:05.189> you'll

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
and if we move it to the right you'll

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.819 
and if we move it to the right you'll
see<00:02:05.639> some<00:02:05.819> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.029> highlights<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
see some of the highlights and the

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
see some of the highlights and the
vineyard<00:02:07.829> hood<00:02:07.950> areas<00:02:08.340> come<00:02:08.610> back<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.090> don't

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
vineyard hood areas come back I don't

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.940 
vineyard hood areas come back I don't
use<00:02:10.049> this<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.439> often

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
use this one often

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.780 
use this one often
and<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.700> does<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.180> its<00:02:13.780> uses<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.550> not

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and it does have its uses but just not

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.759 
and it does have its uses but just not
that<00:02:15.970> often<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.720> use<00:02:16.870> taste<00:02:17.530> for

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
that often and you can use taste for

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.100 
that often and you can use taste for
that<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:18.069> let's<00:02:18.910> come<00:02:19.120> back<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.720> back

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
that one let's come back here and back

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.960 
that one let's come back here and back
off<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.590> vignette<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.790> where

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
off the vignette and get just to where

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.930 
off the vignette and get just to where
we<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.660> be<00:02:22.810> appropriate

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
we think it's going to be appropriate

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.430 
we think it's going to be appropriate
and<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.480> somewhere<00:02:25.870> there<00:02:26.050> maybe<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
and I think somewhere there maybe a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.259 
and I think somewhere there maybe a
little<00:02:26.470> bit<00:02:26.739> more<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.160> feather<00:02:27.550> data<00:02:27.819> softer

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
little bit more of a feather data softer

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.790 
little bit more of a feather data softer
than<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> transition<00:02:30.269> here's<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.510> before<00:02:31.800> as

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
than the transition here's the before as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.410 
than the transition here's the before as
you<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.069> see<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> distraction<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.269> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you can see the distraction is in that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.930 
you can see the distraction is in that
light<00:02:34.840> behind<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.470> cat<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.670> just

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
light behind the cat and this just

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240 
light behind the cat and this just
really<00:02:37.150> draws<00:02:37.480> your<00:02:37.630> attention<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> cat

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
really draws your attention to the cat
