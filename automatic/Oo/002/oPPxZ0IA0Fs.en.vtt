00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
that it has this bunch of features to
make<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:29.130> minecraft<00:01:29.610> either<00:01:29.820> run<00:01:30.090> slower<00:01:30.509> or

at<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> higher<00:01:31.500> rate<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.640> let's<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.090> break

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
at a higher rate so as let's just break

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
at a higher rate so as let's just break
down<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> siding<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.439> render

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
down the siding to you the render

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
down the siding to you the render
distance<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
distance as you can see you can make it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440 
distance as you can see you can make it
at<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> specific<00:01:37.079> level<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:38.430> example<00:01:38.520> before

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
at a specific level for example before

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
at a specific level for example before
I'd<00:01:39.720> say<00:01:39.930> short<00:01:40.320> about<00:01:40.829> medium<00:01:41.369> large<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.210> now

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I'd say short about medium large but now

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
I'd say short about medium large but now
it<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.509> those<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.619> indicating

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it has those little like indicating

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
run faster for example let's turn this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.530 
run faster for example let's turn this
off<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:30.480> off<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.410> off<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.490> everything<00:02:33.150> off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
off this off this off and everything off

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
off this off this off and everything off
because<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:35.010> make<00:02:35.190> our<00:02:35.310> minecraft<00:02:35.730> run

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000
