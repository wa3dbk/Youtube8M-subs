00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 but you're asking that the captain of the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.470
 yellow team onwards be man 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.250
 that's what it wants or is not anything against 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.860
 yulia as I said I had more respect 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.440
 to her and for the respect that is a lady 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 He has not said it but it's time for change in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 the yellow team I think a man of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.930
 take over the reins of the team that thinks 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 that is failing with work julian 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.030
 I believe that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.940
 she is excellent good competitor but 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.390
 I think he needs a little more motivation 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.390
 to the people 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.740
 it looks a bit deconcentrated I do not know 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.810
 what is wrong with him but this too 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.030
 I think it's affected a lot good 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.160
 we have listened to dona april now 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 wants to say something ricardo I think that the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.650
 team is demotivated and how it has 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 as he says toño is absolutely right 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.500
 you thought exactly the same 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 I think exactly that there is a lack of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.140
 leadership here that I do not know what happens 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 with you read I think that state 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.489
 decentralized has motivated us what 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.489
 enough I believe to be able to win 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 allow me a second I'm not talking 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.400
 with the Lord make you talking to me 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.100
 a deconcentration of equipment 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.619
 personal concentration 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.909
 I think it 's generally because here I 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.280
 I'm not the only one who had lost 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.860
 run the entire team 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 a person suitable for the captaincy would be 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.280
 antonio riquelme won it 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.039
 it is asking then change of 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.240
 captaincy directly with captain is 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.429
 the yellow team saying no 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 he wants more to julian it 's nothing personal 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.270
 against what is agreed now in what 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.759
 are asking is to change the gender and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.100
 I change people I want to say 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.200
 something the loss of the team has been fault 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.850
 from each one of us not only from the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.380
 captain and guys are not giving 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.329
 account that robberies are winning us 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.250
 because you are descending 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.119
 and they are letting their strategy win 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.750
 how the reds are joining the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.849
 yellows 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 every time we separate more but what is 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.350
 what is happening 15-15 is one 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.360
 a moment extremely you know toño and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 Ricardo are against 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 that maybe they want julia from the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.790
 captaincy like smooth snake in the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.830
 last season 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.210
 we can not do that we can not allow 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.100
 that the yellow team is one because 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.930
 that is why we characterize ourselves if we are going to 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.520
 continue like this we will continue to lose every 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.520
 day and all 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.410
 I think we 're not saying that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.330
 leave the captaincy we are simply 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.740
 saying to put batteries that put 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.170
 more attention to the team and that motivates them 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.850
 more I just heard the opposite of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.510
 yourself just told me that if 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.060
 you want a change captain 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.739
 where I am asking you to remove it 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.799
 remove from the captaincy not simply 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.629
 we are doing as a call from 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.849
 attention so that the reactions last and 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.590
 if this is the change of the captaincy 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.860
 I think that Antonio would be the person 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.860
 plus 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.439
 with a team what you also do not have 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.620
 way of saying things here in all the 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.620
 world 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.370
 we went the yellow team remember there 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.350
 have to talk about all of those things before 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.060
 please what I respect a little bit I think 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.280
 that she has earned that position and what 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 is fighting the easy 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.019
 of group because one wants to take the other 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.549
 capital because I think the team 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.900
 marc and will have to compensate before 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.120
 to be able to give more statements because 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.159
 apparently they are not all in agreement 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.780
 change of captaincy there are problems there 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.780
 concentration we do not know
