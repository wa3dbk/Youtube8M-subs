now<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> 1700<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> be

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
now we know the 1700 it's going to be

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.859 
now we know the 1700 it's going to be
modular<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.269> more<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> sports

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869

sport touring option from speed and
strength<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> nice<00:00:27.330> part<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
strength and the nice part is you have a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.929

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
spring-loaded drop-down Sun Visor so we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
spring-loaded drop-down Sun Visor so we
have<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.269> working<00:00:30.449> force<00:00:30.779> d-o-t<00:00:31.199> ECE<00:00:31.590> rated

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
have that working force d-o-t ECE rated

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
have that working force d-o-t ECE rated
and<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:32.610> estimation<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> fact

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and in my estimation I like the fact

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
and in my estimation I like the fact
that<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.200> 3<00:00:34.350> pounds<00:00:34.620> 9<00:00:34.800> ounces<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.460> going

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that it's 3 pounds 9 ounces it's going

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.639 
that it's 3 pounds 9 ounces it's going
to<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.390> pretty<00:00:36.870> light<00:00:37.110> weight<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to have a pretty light weight to it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
to have a pretty light weight to it
considering<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> modular<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.390> that
