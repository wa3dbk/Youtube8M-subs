00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.370
 Show nose 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.190
 like lack of Mac OS x Lyon on a the computer does not play any 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.299
 OS has on it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.550
 The reasons for this are manifold maybe can be completely new 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 Do not put snow Leopard or weeding a Mac's hard drive 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.289
 against one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.509
 yes it is the exchange 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.970
 the first step 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 meets one in the App Store Inpex Tor's quite prominent samples 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.980
 currently lending USGS 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.650
 you can do that 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.220
 then click the price in the German store are 23 commas 23 EUR 99 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.810
 Join 3com on four new planes as you can see 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 I already have it installed here 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.170
 that would be quite boring if it is already four possible 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.430
 Download Gigabyte 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.070
 Percent the customer reviews are good so far 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.680
 and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.040
 yes, I'm looking forward to Lyon Arn 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.800
 if small field hour has been loaded you will recognize that by yourself 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.829
 ProSieben opens an installation window 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.470
 we do not want that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.060
 At least not on these machines I'm sitting 'her husband Mac Hog 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 not for an iMac because of that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 Let's put that aside and open the enemies in the club 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 you can now find import by programs 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.470
 Per cent Mac OS x Lion installations 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.550
 that's easy here you go Patrik Kühnen has shown 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.610
 then a new window opens which is then the content of the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.189
 Installation file Dietikon on Contents and then on Stilz Support 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.829
 and there is one in the valley Iris the point the the 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.120
 the club in the 4 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.660
 and just pull it any directory I've anyway for the test if 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.480
 chosen 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.230
 around you can see the file is already there, of course, the savings 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.840
 Copying it then really learned to duplicate the file and take it 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.410
 so that for the three come 7 4 gigabytes but also a few minutes 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.749
 that cut everything off 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.189
 in the poem that already copied and already tested 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.659
 Next we will create the disk utility 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.719
 that finds in winter maintenance programs and then no programs programs utilities 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.440
 Disk Utility 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.629
 Part of this 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 Percent in the disk utility I've got it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.239
 as a preparer Tan 8 gigabytes of Kensington usb-stick then in 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.169
 Klöden Zahnd currently formats in percent of the TuS fact with it too 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.679
 really anyone can read 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.589
 and me here 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.040
 must click on the menu command Create 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.529
 as the teammates 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.719
 Velen MGE down the valley from the SPD in the out 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.089
 lead there 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.039
 the target medium 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 I just took her dandelion and pulled Judo 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.869
 then click on «restore» Attention all data disclosed games 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.209
 went lost 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.029
 Delete year 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.029
 it would have to enter the system password again 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.009
 then with it now the usb-stick 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:12.979
 cleared of drive 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
 on percent Mac OS already old 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.839
 it will be switched to the MAK case system 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.719
 and 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.949
 then the usb-stick is ready 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.059
 the whole thing lasts 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.619
 Watch the year between 20 and 30 minutes so for Susanne Herz episode 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.899
 there even says Werner Tampen break is finished 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:37.229
 and for you to run the design of yourself, we should just go 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.649
 let's go through now said 45 minutes 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:42.209
 we'll see 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.040
 just run through if the finished neatly evaluate and then 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.809
 was her last by the way 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.849
 5 takes a bit of the surprise of iMac services ever so that 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.299
 it really is the safe method of how this works Oakland then it works the same 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.279
 continue to invest 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.889
 So the stick is ready and now let's see if that's what 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.570
 Once upon a time, for the Red Steelers supervision Lyon from the usb stick 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.010
 As he notes the Commerzbank, I had to install it a bit 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.630
 to change 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.219
 because their natural not screen box can separate 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.829
 should be discussed 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.520
 i had to pressed a switch and pressed like she did 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.789
 With 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.169
 most beautiful and as usual from the steering 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.939
 he answers 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.189
 I have to admit, of course, I have already tried in advance so that 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.110
 just take a while now 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.360
 and then 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.499
 MW in the installation times 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.550
 mode 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 Do not be surprised we have now mostly here for several seconds 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.190
 applies until the end of April 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.409
 Here I can just describe the project 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.019
 and that will make it a problem that will likely be under the track 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:02.019
 the writer is 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.329
 that happens if you let it unscrew 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.050
 the windshield Franek to the way only 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.419
 sticks 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.819
 magnets 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:16.969
 Yes 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.539
 I was able to defeat her in that natural law did not depress anything so 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.110
 now everything works fully automatically now does not have to be afraid 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.110
 that would like to start with the selection of Daimler 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.169
 m the 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.620
 Magic Mouse close to that is the same the front look inside so had the 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.460
 is 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.550
 Despite the brand new hard drive, her opinion is still recognized by Philip 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.940
 another second mouse Mang the new MacBook 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.689
 the Wittlicher can be really noticed as the pairing 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.689
 German as standard language and 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.220
 to reinstall Mac OS x is dead 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.059
 i am going to open disk utility because 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.419
 the hard disk No bit has been named wrong 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.580
 so we have here 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.240
 I hope that I mean their 200 40 municipalities six gigabytes ots the time 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.719
 Value Ex 3 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.789
 to really delete it now and Mandy but where is fix 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.069

 Crippen was driving away 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.569
 to add installation of MAK OS x 10 points for him click
