altogether<00:06:47.980> here's<00:06:48.400> an<00:06:48.550> interesting<00:06:48.790> glitch

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
altogether here's an interesting glitch

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.070 
altogether here's an interesting glitch
and<00:06:50.040> voila<00:06:51.330> you<00:06:52.330> got<00:06:52.570> yourself<00:06:55.080> camouflage

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
and voila you got yourself camouflage

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.670 
and voila you got yourself camouflage
armor<00:06:56.560> as<00:06:57.090> you<00:06:58.090> can<00:06:58.240> see<00:06:58.480> I<00:06:58.660> have<00:06:58.750> one<00:06:59.260> glove

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
that's how it's going to look like it

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.330 
that's how it's going to look like it
basically<00:07:02.110> covered<00:07:02.590> with<00:07:02.770> leaves<00:07:02.920> i'm<00:07:03.190> not

basically covered with leaves i'm not
really<00:07:03.580> sure<00:07:03.700> if<00:07:04.120> it<00:07:04.840> helps<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:05.860> environment

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
really sure if it helps the environment

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.090 
really sure if it helps the environment
or<00:07:06.610> I<00:07:06.700> mean<00:07:07.060> it<00:07:07.240> helps<00:07:07.570> yourself<00:07:08.020> or<00:07:08.230> protects
