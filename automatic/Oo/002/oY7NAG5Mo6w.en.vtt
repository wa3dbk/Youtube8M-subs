00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.079

 gamemeneer because times when you do too 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.350
 as good as I am and I 'm just going to rest 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.869
 and it is already very few people now 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.189
 but we'll see who 's going 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 at least try to enter it now 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.540
 if it works 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.610
 yes it works ok people got in the way 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 stand you watch the interaction or full 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 of the least twelve 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.329
 I am very curious I still have it 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.979
 not played these games no that lie 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.259
 I played it once but that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 translation went wrong I was immediately in the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.259
 first minute I was already dead it is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.670
 namely a boy's best trick 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.200
 you can play with 12 people 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.060
 thieme it yet 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
 a few rainy season began 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.150
 but I want that out of my mind for if 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.470
 you are the curious you can 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.940
 just join the server 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.459
 your p's that of course as always in the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.410
 description and yes you can of course 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.410
 just from our recordings you are really sitting 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.599
 in the folder that was built by orion 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.069
 with his team yes the chesten and all 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.440
 things and power-ups are all 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.050
 I can go back the same with this ball 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.730
 my kills and my coins stand up 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.140
 the game is about to start and we climb 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.880
 nothing black I'm black 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.170
 ow there probably because i am one of them 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.760
 first was that join the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.890
 two people are needed to rest anyway 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.870
 so play as the Russian on the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.489
 server then you can even go with a friend 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.200
 play should also start running 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.640
 I have to run and watch it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 deposit shadows 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 look him go so he thinks the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.519
 way to money i go there but i do 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.829
 know he is testing somewhere q 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.840
 darcy can be between the architect you 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.640
 I received a route from someone from 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.840
 where exactly you should walk by what 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.739
 useful 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.480
 but yes that route does of course 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.579
 lost longer now can not can now can 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.959
 by the way, that was stuttering now 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.750
 no one can attack me 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.890
 look the grace is still on so that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.480
 ends now 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.600
 and that means you can meet each other now 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.700
 attacks and nobody happily follows me 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.459
 i do n't know that year where the christ 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.720
 I have just somewhere will randomly go 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.579
 walk 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.049
 you still have those towers on 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.910
 the end an ear to and north and it 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.579
 South of the map are two of those 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.620
 towers of course and those towers are 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.810
 full of zombies here they come further 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.850
 almost not against but in those towers yes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.959
 and those are also best ops zombies I see 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.970
 someone walk there 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.260
 I'm going to bend over and I'm Coming up 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 killer I think very young on her in 2 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.099
 ok ok ok no no no he has one 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.670
 oh i'm dead again you see i'm such 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.139
 loupe in this oh my god i give you right away 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.730
 I should have done an attack 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.349
 I shouldn't have done that at all 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.120
 but i can eat bacon now and then can 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.889
 I watch another people leave 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.530
 let's look at what gamemeneer on 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.989
 we do is you go straight KrÃ¤fte how 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.090
 it does not go for the chess that goes 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.169
 really purely just forces 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.209
 I do not know if it so smart 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.400
 choice is because you are nice 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.010
 what chest on the server what you now 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.419
 for a maximum of 30 minutes as against 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.889
 that time nobody is dead at all or 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.050
 if there are two people left 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.900
 then you get a so-called death match 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.099
 he is going to make you steam pickaxe now 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.090
 that is just looking at some others 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.050
 people i like to be one 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.270
 little to eat bacon 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.879
 he is still silent here 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.409
 two people have no idea here 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.599
 oil thieme 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.949
 Hard Styler and DJ Wesley 12 who are on 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.349
 the thieme 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.870
 it may just be smart you have that 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.430
 tower of course and that tower that stands 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.900
 full of those dangerous zombies me 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.099
 I also died once 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.139
 that was the first time I was there 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.629
 dying it's really sick 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.819
 when you find him you will find that secret corridor 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.069
 where you are now with two 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.599
 find it really cool that it is now 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.490
 finally just a little audience there 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.189
 but that people can finally do that 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.069
 and that you can play that too 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.289
 but only remember from Sunday 3 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.229
 so get a donation rank with one 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.990
 wide is there then you know 100% sure 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.539
 you can put the substance on the server on the white 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.009
 and and so on the live stream 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.199
 come we just go gamemeneer 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.120
 follow the game ends in 17 minutes 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.669
 is then bottom left so we just go 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.089
 follow and see if he is still taking action 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.939
 experience 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.469
 the game ends in 14 minutes and I am sitting 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.659
 still and disappeared minutes I follow 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.750
 see that the ton plan is also disabled 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.399
 are left as eight candidates 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.960
 of the twelfth I am already four dead 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.839
 really feel a look man i'm so fast 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.699
 die very far too fast just as well 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.469
 He has again found that with but 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.639
 can he do something with it 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.939
 he is not completely filled a 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.529
 pickaxe no he can't do anything with it 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.300
 oh oh i see two people arriving in 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:01.080
 the distance 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.649
 oh oh and a zombie holy shit what goes 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.289
 happen here 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:07.580
 it is the team they series boy that they 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.580
 with the 12th and already served 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.490
 oh there goes an enderpearl and then goes 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.599

 henk no sir it was a fashion trade away 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.770

 and with xerion yes
