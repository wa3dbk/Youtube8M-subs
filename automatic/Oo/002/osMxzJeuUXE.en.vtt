00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.880
 see in the title of this video today you 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.500
 I bring a makeup tutorial is a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.800
 of the big trends this fall 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.150
 2013 I personally love the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.520
 makeup trends of these 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 factions but specifically I think that 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 it is my favorite I use it very very to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 often good very often 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 I do not use it for every day to go to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 work but when I'm going out there 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.290
 well, I do not use clear, so today 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 I am very happy to bring you this tutorial 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.400
 for the eyes I have chosen these colors 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 metalized that I think combine the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.199
 perfection with the burgundy color of the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 lips I think it's a look that combines 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.900
 more for the night to go to dinner for 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.489
 go out there all supposed can 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 simplify the look does not need to 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.060
 use the same ones with which I have 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.740
 used you can choose to use some 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 shadows while in the eyes instead of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.649
 the metallic colors you can choose 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.960
 put false eyelashes you can opt for 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.910
 put them that totally depends on you and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.650

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.410
 total sun the whole show all that 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.230
 I love the show that I hope this 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.570

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.540
 here in the comments 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.400
 written because I read all of you 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.850
 comments and I love seeing that 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.290
 we recreate the blogs that I teach you well 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.890
 so if you want to see this tutorial 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.890
 makeup 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.900
 Y 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.490
 let's start using this color is 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.409
 a light peach color we're going to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.750
 apply in the basin or the fold of 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.120
 eye making circular movements 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 for this we are going to use a brush of 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.830
 blur 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.130
 then we will use this color 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.110
 brown soft and with the same brush you 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 let's apply a little lower than the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.070
 other color 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.180
 let's now use these colors 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.130
 metallic 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.710
 we will start using the darker the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.330
 number 3 and with a soft brush we're going to 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.590
 Apply it to little touches on the eyelid 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.240
 higher 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 we will continue to apply it until 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.710
 let's get the intensity of color that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780
 we wish now I will use this spray 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.030
 fixer if you do not have also you can 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.590
 use water and with the wet brush 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.630
 let's re-apply the shadow 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.170
 metallized in this way we get 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 that the color is much more intense 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.300
 now we are going to use the same palette 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.980
 but this time the number 2 color is very 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.290
 bad describing the colors but as 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.739
 you can see it is a metallic brown color 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.459
 and we are going to apply it on top of the other 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.380
 combining these two colors 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.110
 we will be able to give more dimension to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.130
 eyelid we take now the same brush of 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.260
 blur and blur the lines 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 I think the secret to this look is that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.670
 everything is super blurred 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.040
 now we take a beige color that does not 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.959
 have brightness with a brush to blur 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.180
 we will apply it below the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.620
 eyebrow and in the lacrimal this color we 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.510
 will help to finish blurring the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.670
 colors now I used a color 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.260
 white that has a little bit of brightness what 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.000
 let's apply again below the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.670
 area and this color will help us 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 illuminate that area now it 's time to 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.780
 touch up the colors if we believe that at 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.640
 blur have lost intensity for 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.440
 delineate the eye I have used a 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.209
 waterproof black eyeliner 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.310
 you here you can choose if you want 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.250
 a liquid cream eyeliner what 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.890
 you want 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:58.370
 and we delineate the eye marking well the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:04:00.200
 outer line of the eyelashes well 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.130
 now we do the tabs well and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.130
 we apply mask 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.739
 this step is totally optional but 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.110
 as I said at the beginning I wanted 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.790
 have the complete kit so I'm here 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.790
 I'm going to apply Spain's explosives 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.599
 let's delineate the lower lashes 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.830
 and with a pencil brush we are going to take 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.330
 the same light brown color and we are going to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.330
 blur all the eyeliner 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.029
 once the glue is physical I have 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.800
 applied mascara so that 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.599
 so my natural eyelashes are mixed 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.279
 with false eyelashes and more 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.379
 natural to clean any shade 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:52.789
 there have fallen on his face I 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.789
 applied a little bit of concealer 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.850
 I have also applied a little bit of 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.560
 bronzer to define my face and here 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.270
 in the area where I am showing you is 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.770
 where he applied the rouge those areas were 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.140
 they call the manzanitas and we can 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.730
 find when smiling the area that remains 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.160
 highest is where the blusher 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.770
 have to go 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.900
 and let's go for the lips when I use 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.970
 dark colors I like to first apply 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.590
 an eyeliner delineates the lips and 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.090
 I also stuffed them inside that 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.090
 way the color lasts much more wind 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.770
 i 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.009
 and finally the star of this look 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.169
 It is an intense garnet color 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.999
 when we use dark colors what 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.229
 last thing we want is to stain the 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.969
 our lipstick teeth 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.979
 truth is that to avoid it 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.199
 we use a little bit of paper what 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.879
 we press with our lips and what 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.949
 it remains on paper is the excess bar 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.559
 of lips another way is using 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.899
 also our fingers had a 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.819
 side to side of our lips and so the 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:59.740
 excess lipstick will go to 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.740
 our fingers and not our teeth 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:09.100
 same as we already have our look for 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.230
