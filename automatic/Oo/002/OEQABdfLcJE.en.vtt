00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.029
 so I'm still 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.960
 No, but yes, I am I. 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 do not understand 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
 soon we will invent we invent 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 debates it's always that it tires me 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 a little bit now you want this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.949
 friendly match tonight ben this is the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 trend but no but it would be good 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.529
 these two women love the pure and do 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.699
 the aperitif is true no, but because 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.800
 because when we invent we tell 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 anything so today in 2013 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the afternoon it is you who small 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.519
 we are talking about the golden ball and beaten 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.380
 then we talk about it more 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 no it's a debate that we point 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 view who is who and not far from the number 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 what Belgian gentleman is explained on 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.120
 golden ball so we discover there in 2013 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 that it's the 57th golden ball that the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 tradition of awarding prizes even in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.450
 collective sport has always existed 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.969
 personal distinctions in the sport 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 collective bass and the game happened the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.879
 hall of fame traditions all these 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 there's jerseys that goes up to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.050
 sky of the guy who marked the story of a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.809
 club of one of a country 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.079
 even though it was an individuality in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.940
 a hedge in a collective team 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.589
 in the Tour de France the yellow jersey but 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 also because his other teammates 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.240
 help to gain help in the mountains 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.830
 help on the way there there is a guy 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 out of the ordinary that allows a team 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 even in a collective eric shine 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.439
 refers to papin there is tremendously 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 example maradona did win 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.479
 argentine platini france zidane has 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 helped the blues it was the leader as 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.390
 others have been the very leaders in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.210
 a collective sport there are 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 individualities that stands out so that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 has absolutely nothing outrageous it is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 the 57th is in the tradition 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 of our sport I think it's great 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 now the only reproach the only 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.229
 reserve she and she is historic 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
 we broke with tradition 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.459
 is that today we have changed the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.619
 vote in a kind of big anyone 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.590
 what where finally there are players and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 624 voters and people the problem 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.170
 when you vote 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.490
 you have to be responsible for what you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.929
 make two selfconfident whatsoever 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.429
 important to you I even 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.880
 the vanuatu coach to the teams 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.369
 national 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.539
 I have the impression for that I hope and gold 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.009
 I have the impression that for some this 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.349
 is not important and that coach 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000
 from any country vote I do not care 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.440
 I find it very well on the contrary 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.209
 I'm not scornful of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.590
 small countries on the other hand I preferred 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.269
 the old version I explained it a thousand 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.610
 time because when it was 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.860
 journalists who voted there was in 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 the golden ball wholesale the flashback of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 what had happened in the year these 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 oars were reporters the attention 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.440
 but unfortunately the players vote 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.670
 a little bit anyhow and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.230
 often do not care a little about their 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.110
 votes when we see the team the eleven who 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.269
 elected it will serve anything it's 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 that's okay because those who 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.569
 were voting was responsible at this time 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.760
 there to see what had happened in 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.870
 the year it was said was intel was 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.459
 golden ball but that means that in 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.170
 this world cup he shone during 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.379
 focal point 10 but if it should not 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.060
 win it must be iniesta or schneider 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.560
 who was european champion this year 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.250
 there and who takes his team to the final of 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.840
 world Cup 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.310
 yeah that allowed to have benchmarks 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.930
 it was interesting because 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.269
 it was historicity anyway an album 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.650
 of stories that's the problem 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.629
 I agree with you on his daniels 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 and that's it and coach curse is a bit on 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.060
 the same line him claiming three 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.379
 golden balloons for guard wars 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.580
 still for the defensive players 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.580
 for the offensive game 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.150
 he had said that in 3 10-3 but in 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.709
 reality is by line or what 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.420
 an attacking midfielder defender 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.799
 but I think it's a good idea 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.599
 this action the price discounts it's 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.640
 nice prize giving I think that 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.110
 nice me here is the milk that come to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.110
 think of it is good
