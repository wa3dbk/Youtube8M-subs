00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 we take noise all the way 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.940
 of course 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.250
 be it flowing water a cat 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 or even a train the job of a good one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 It is just this microphone 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 of course to capture noises and that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.029
 without distorting electrical distortion 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.890
 or hum 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 i finally arrived two months ago 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
 a new microphone and it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.990
 seems to meet all these demands 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 yes it even has a little one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.610
 nice feature but more on that later 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 the blues tactic is classy and is too 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.420
 so built apart from that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.730
 it his name this red orange 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.170
 color does not necessarily make any honor 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 It looks really pretty and I have it 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 like to stand next to a desk 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 it is quite a lot and therefore it is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 advisable stable microphone stand to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.600
 buy because otherwise under the weight 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.219
 just fold it up 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 Microphone games weighs alone 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.660
 Almost as much as the microphone and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 she herself is also wonderfully built and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 goes great with the design of the blue 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 Products do their job namely that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.609
 balancing bumps against the tripod 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.769
 or making disk drives 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.780
 She was very good and I could do everything here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.920
 in everything really nothing negative 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.450
 notice that Bruce Buck is sitting very much 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.310
 stuck on the spider and it takes one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.320
 good time to get in or out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 to turn because it is not everyone 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.799
 day power is that he is a plus point that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.390
 means it really holds very fast and you 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 it can sometimes hang upside down 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.570
 pop filter, however, there is the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 biggest criticism of the lousberg 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.530
 he could avoid pop loud 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.450
 like Peter or horse as well as even 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.979
 not and the only thing he does is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 look really great 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.000
 I have one for this reason 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.439
 10 euro pop filter purchased at Amazon 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.240
 better still has him of mine 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.369
 old microphone and he is always at the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 fixed tripod so I have no pop 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.090
 loud but still a nice design 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.799
 At the football we have only one button and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.909
 no jack output that means we 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.040
 unfortunately no headphones 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.259
 connect but this button is activated 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.329
 a focus mode that allows you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.350
 to stand a little further away from the blue or 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.570
 to speak 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.590
 and still no ambient noise 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.119
 record 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 This is a mode I would 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.149
 always recommend you if you are in front of the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.770
 camera sits and talks because then yes 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 not necessarily very close to the microphone 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.280
 but want to be now I'll go to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 sounded over, of course , already heard him 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 all the time I'm in the blues 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.560
 bar a speaker compared to others 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110
 we have microphones at the blue 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 microphone but a special one 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 they have a really nice one 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.610
 coloring your voice deeper and deeper 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.740
 sounds fuller 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.010
 such colorations are quite intentional 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.990
 and at the price of 155 euro completely 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.270
 not common in plain language that means 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.100
 just that sounded nice and full 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.810
 rich sounds what the listener it 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.760
 makes the whole thing more pleasant 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.170
 to follow spoken when it the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 However, you should not like it 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.080
 of course that also in the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.370
 Post processing has a thing to change 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.260
 I have not mentioned it yet 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.420
 that's the connection below that's one 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.490
 xl connection and it is quite normal that 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.380
 your pc or mac does not have but 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.300
 just for that there is a usb 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.430
 interface in my case that 's it 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.410
 test seal a tube into which the xl 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.840
 cable in and on the other side 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.160
 USB cable comes out again Michael 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.930
 you can control how you do it yourself 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.430
 sensitive to the microphone 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.810
 to be and that's it 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.150
 actually already the advantage of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.739
 such xlr connections is that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.720
 to retrofit them in the future or 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.520
 you can upgrade that better 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.170
 only costs 50 euros and is so 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.489
 actually not too cheap 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.260
 cheap but for the price really 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.330
 really good but let's assume now 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.810
 you do not want more freedom in the future 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.100
 problem 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
 Just buy a new interface 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.200
 connect it and you're done then 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.950
 much more freedom and that is more real 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.180
 Pluspunkt that was also one of the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.010
 Main reasons why I have the blues bar 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.930
 just bought it because it is in this 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.610
 price category usually no xl 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.799
 makes such a nice coloring or 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.900
 Altogether such a great sound picture of 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.060
 bigger brother of the blues park the blue 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.830
 Blue Bird has my colleague Felix was for 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.570
 you tested there could be over 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.430
 My opinion is the blood bath 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.170
 has a super great price 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.000
 performance ratio as we just 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.890
 No rushing and packing 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.750
 is much more horny anyway than at 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.670
 Every other microphone but what means 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.680
 what do you think about the sound of the blues? 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.340
 park writes that one down in the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.720
 Comments 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.880
 below you will find a row 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.040
 from buy left the ongoing in the price 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.180
 fluctuate because it is cheaper there 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.530
 that was it again from me 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.530
 load up on the tree
