the speeds of them so that you know

the speeds of them so that you know
what's<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.150> happening<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> have

what's actually happening but you have

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.120 
what's actually happening but you have
to<00:01:25.049> realize<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.950> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
for months down line and it's been two

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.250 
for months down line and it's been two
months<00:02:41.250> since<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.550> my<00:02:41.700> super<00:02:41.940> came<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.480> I

Z battle of gods originates place about
five<00:03:47.430> years<00:03:47.700> after<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.540> end<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> majin<00:03:48.959> buu

five years after the end of majin buu

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.350 
five years after the end of majin buu
which<00:03:49.260> would<00:03:49.530> make<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.860> pan<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.730> about<00:03:50.970> four

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
which would make a pan just about four

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.420 
which would make a pan just about four
years<00:03:51.450> old<00:03:51.630> where<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.769> final<00:03:53.040> term<00:03:53.190> takes

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
years old where the final term takes

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.310 
years old where the final term takes
place<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.910> at<00:03:54.060> animals<00:03:54.570> II<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.230> again

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
place I was at animals II but then again

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.500 
place I was at animals II but then again
that<00:03:55.440> could<00:03:55.799> also<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.040> being<00:03:56.730> changed<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.480> we

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that could also be being changed so we

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.150 
that could also be being changed so we
don't<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.230> far<00:03:58.440> as<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.590> timeline<00:03:58.799> we

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
don't know as far as the timeline we

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.250 
don't know as far as the timeline we
don't<00:03:59.400> know<00:03:59.579> it's<00:04:00.269> not<00:04:00.450> six<00:04:00.720> months<00:04:00.930> after<00:04:01.079> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
don't know it's not six months after the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.170 
don't know it's not six months after the
so<00:04:01.410> there's<00:04:01.560> seven<00:04:01.739> s<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.890> point<00:04:02.040> out<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.640> I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
so there's seven s to point out so I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720
