two whole steps in the half step three

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.420 
two whole steps in the half step three
whole<00:01:40.880> steps<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.270> half<00:01:41.390> step<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.110> a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
whole steps and a half step so we have a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.920 
whole steps and a half step so we have a
B<00:01:43.430> C<00:01:44.030> sharp<00:01:44.060> d<00:01:44.720> e<00:01:44.990> F<00:01:45.890> sharp<00:01:45.920> G<00:01:46.369> sharp<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.090> okay

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
B C sharp d e F sharp G sharp and a okay

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.780 
B C sharp d e F sharp G sharp and a okay
so<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.470> need<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.680> transpose<00:01:49.430> all<00:01:49.670> these

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
so if you need to transpose all these

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.940 
so if you need to transpose all these
chords<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.360> can<00:01:50.390> do<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.560> if<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.830> go

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
chords you can do so so if you go

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:03.100 
chords you can do so so if you go
through<00:01:51.979> all<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> G<00:01:52.520> chords

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.350 

okay<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.490> can<00:02:04.640> play<00:02:04.790> all<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.030> course<00:02:05.240> and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
okay so you can play all this course and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.400 
okay so you can play all this course and
it<00:02:05.420> has<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.840> bit<00:02:05.960> different<00:02:06.260> than<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
it has a little bit different than the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.680 
it has a little bit different than the
sound<00:02:06.680> now<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.160> all<00:02:07.970> these<00:02:08.119> chords<00:02:08.570> are<00:02:08.600> in

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
sound now and all these chords are in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.880 
sound now and all these chords are in
the<00:02:08.750> key<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.470> can<00:02:09.590> transpose

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
the key of a now so you can transpose

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.220 
the key of a now so you can transpose
them<00:02:10.070> if<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.250> need<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.789> G<00:02:10.970> becomes<00:02:11.270> an<00:02:11.360> A

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
them if you need to so G becomes an A

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.229 
them if you need to so G becomes an A
all<00:02:13.680> right<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.250> minor<00:02:14.670> seven<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
all right and you're a minor seven that

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.680 
all right and you're a minor seven that
comes<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.480> B<00:02:15.569> minor<00:02:15.750> 7<00:02:16.640> -<00:02:17.640> B<00:02:17.760> minor<00:02:17.970> 7<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
comes with B minor 7 - B minor 7 for the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.460 
comes with B minor 7 - B minor 7 for the
key<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> G<00:02:19.050> becomes<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.560> c-sharp<00:02:20.010> minor<00:02:20.340> 7<00:02:21.470> ok

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
key of G becomes a c-sharp minor 7 ok

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.940 
key of G becomes a c-sharp minor 7 ok
and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:22.800> your<00:02:23.340> C<00:02:23.700> becomes<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.239> D<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.470> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and then your C becomes your D and so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.820 
and then your C becomes your D and so
forth<00:02:26.190> ok<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.870> key<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.170> pretty<00:02:28.319> close<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
forth ok so this key is pretty close to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.370 
forth ok so this key is pretty close to
the<00:02:28.920> key<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:30.150> far<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.569> sound<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.170> um

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.810 
key of C alright so let's look at
another<00:03:13.290> key<00:03:13.590> let's<00:03:13.770> look<00:03:13.980> at<00:03:14.100> our<00:03:14.220> D<00:03:14.460> chords

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
another key let's look at our D chords

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.270 
another key let's look at our D chords
that<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:15.330> learned<00:03:15.830> okay<00:03:16.830> let's<00:03:17.040> say<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.250> we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that we learned okay let's say if we

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020 
that we learned okay let's say if we
want<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> play<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> key<00:03:18.240> of<00:03:18.480> E<00:03:19.340> with<00:03:20.340> D<00:03:20.610> okay

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
want to play in the key of E with D okay

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.790 
want to play in the key of E with D okay
so<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.780> two<00:03:21.930> options<00:03:22.110> now<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.680> play

so we have two options now we can play

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.620 
so we have two options now we can play
those<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.340> cool<00:03:23.460> open<00:03:23.880> e<00:03:24.030> chords<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.540> we

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
those really cool open e chords that we

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.600 
those really cool open e chords that we

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
learned or we can use the D chords and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
learned or we can use the D chords and
play<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.970> key<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.150> E<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:27.960> capo<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
play in the key of E so we capo the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.620 
play in the key of E so we capo the
second<00:03:29.040> fret<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.700> you're<00:03:29.970> moving<00:03:30.090> B<00:03:30.450> up

to a d sharp to an e so you're moving up

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
to a d sharp to an e so you're moving up
to<00:03:32.910> two<00:03:33.030> spaces<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.020> move<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> end<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> the
