00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
other and everything and then you have

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.450 
other and everything and then you have
probably<00:03:09.810> seen<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.379> one<00:03:10.590> already

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.770 

and<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.170> kind<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.890> wanted<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.790> add

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and this is kind of I wanted to add

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.820 
and this is kind of I wanted to add
these<00:03:23.680> girls<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.390> painting<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.960> air<00:03:26.170> but

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
these girls in this painting of air but

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.780 
these girls in this painting of air but
then<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> thought<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.370> would<00:03:27.550> be<00:03:27.760> maybe<00:03:28.030> somehow

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
then I thought it would be maybe somehow

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.700 
then I thought it would be maybe somehow
more<00:03:30.790> interesting<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:31.840> leave<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.380> like
