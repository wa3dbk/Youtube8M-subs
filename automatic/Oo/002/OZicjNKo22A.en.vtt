the occasional crush this is to be

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.780 
the occasional crush this is to be

therefore I can't really talk to you
about<00:04:02.090> battery<00:04:02.600> life<00:04:02.630> but<00:04:03.610> here<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
about battery life but here is the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.340 
about battery life but here is the
results<00:04:05.960> I've<00:04:06.110> been<00:04:06.320> getting<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:06.830> far<00:04:11.110> as<00:04:12.110> you

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
results I've been getting so far as you

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.449 
results I've been getting so far as you
can<00:04:12.440> see<00:04:13.090> 23%<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.210> 1204<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.800> seventy

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
can see 23% on 1204 this is a seventy

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.660 
can see 23% on 1204 this is a seventy
percent<00:04:16.750> brightness<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.200> isn't<00:04:19.100> too<00:04:19.250> bad<00:04:19.400> but

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
percent brightness so isn't too bad but

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.460 
percent brightness so isn't too bad but
not<00:04:20.360> as<00:04:20.420> good<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:20.810> called<00:04:21.020> gt3<00:04:24.250> however<00:04:25.250> for

not as good as called gt3 however for
