00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:16.859
 everybody wants to have a smartphone 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.539
 nowadays, right? 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.939
 but the problem that I see in the hour of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 choose a thinker to buy between 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 so many different models and it is by 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 This is what we are here today, victory. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 to get the main doubts and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.270
 suggest the lg optimus that has more to do 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 With you but what I should know 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 make a good choice because I confess 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 that I am like most people 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 I always look for a handsome device. 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.860
 modern camera that has a good and clear camera 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 that has a cool screen and that is easy 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 to play undoubtedly all this is very 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 important though there are some other 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 details worth checking out 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.660
 when it comes to buying one of the most 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.640
 important to analyze is the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 processor if it has a good 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 speed and with the number of cores 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 or how we say how much the cuts 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.900
 processing it has speed in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.479
 processing cores as well as 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.850
 Calm down that I'll explain the speed is 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.549
 measured in megahertz or gigahertz and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 principle the higher the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.500
 number of processing cores 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 the cuts are the famous ones of al khor quad 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
 core or five bodies 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.369
 the more processor cores you have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 the ability to perform more than 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.689
 a task at the same time 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 Look, guys, I want to make an addendum here. 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.579
 some users the battery life is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 much more important than high 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.979
 graphics performance for games by 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.049
 example 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.930
 so if this is your case a device 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.070
 single cotton lg optimus l3 is the best 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.290
 option for you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.469
 Now that you've explained, it's easy. 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.149
 then the nuclei are like 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.189
 blenders for example if I 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.070
 want to hit 8 liters of vitamin D 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.450
 strawberry but the blender cup has 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.129
 only two liters 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.379
 so I 'll take more time to 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.150
 to carry out the entire task of what I had 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.370
 four blenders 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.079
 access to the same eight liters would be 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.870
 much faster then 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.640
 it is even perfect his example as 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 higher the processor speed in 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.159
 giga hertz and how many more cores or kors 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.560
 he has faster your smartphone goes 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.750
 be too many tasks at the same time he 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
 will be able to run without locking the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.579
 payment for these devices are 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.769
