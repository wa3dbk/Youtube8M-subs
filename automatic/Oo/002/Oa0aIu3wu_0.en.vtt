00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
one of the most important aspect of

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.770 
one of the most important aspect of
manufacturing<00:00:05.930> is<00:00:06.140> Quality<00:00:06.920> Assurance<00:00:07.040> and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:07.780 
manufacturing is Quality Assurance and

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.910 
manufacturing is Quality Assurance and
the<00:00:08.780> next<00:00:09.050> step<00:00:09.380> that<00:00:09.410> we're<00:00:09.650> going<00:00:09.679> to<00:00:09.830> be

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
the next step that we're going to be

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.909 
the next step that we're going to be
doing<00:00:10.070> is<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.849> is<00:00:10.999> a<00:00:11.030> fully<00:00:11.389> assembled<00:00:11.959> F<00:00:12.289> 112

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:12.919 
doing is this is a fully assembled F 112

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.039 
doing is this is a fully assembled F 112
gloss<00:00:13.329> international<00:00:14.329> so<00:00:14.719> this<00:00:14.869> is<00:00:15.019> a

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
gloss international so this is a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.890 
gloss international so this is a
240-volt<00:00:15.860> version<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.789> what<00:00:17.390> Kurtis<00:00:17.810> is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
240-volt version and what Kurtis is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.020 
240-volt version and what Kurtis is
ready<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.289> do<00:00:18.440> he<00:00:19.010> is<00:00:19.040> going<00:00:19.370> to<00:00:19.520> perform<00:00:19.850> a

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
ready to do he is going to perform a

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.840 
ready to do he is going to perform a
dielectric<00:00:20.660> test<00:00:21.020> using<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.740> AC<00:00:22.400> high

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
dielectric test using the AC high

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.850 
dielectric test using the AC high
podcaster<00:00:23.600> and<00:00:23.780> basically<00:00:24.500> we're<00:00:24.680> going<00:00:24.800> to

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
podcaster and basically we're going to

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.950 
podcaster and basically we're going to
go<00:00:24.980> ahead<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:25.280> check<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.550> insulation<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.690> all

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
go ahead and check the insulation of all

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.540 
go ahead and check the insulation of all
the<00:00:27.260> components<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:27.920> make<00:00:28.070> sure<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.370> there's

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the components to make sure that there's

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.390 
the components to make sure that there's
no<00:00:28.700> breakdown<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.660> at<00:00:30.410> any<00:00:30.770> given<00:00:31.100> time

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
no breakdown and that at any given time

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.240 
no breakdown and that at any given time
the<00:00:32.029> heating<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.020> not<00:00:33.079> going<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.620> become<00:00:33.950> hot

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
the heating is not going to become hot

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.850 
the heating is not going to become hot
so<00:00:35.240> what<00:00:35.420> he<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.690> going<00:00:35.900> to<00:00:35.990> do<00:00:36.140> he<00:00:36.380> is<00:00:36.410> going<00:00:36.740> to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
so what he is going to do he is going to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.440 
so what he is going to do he is going to
inject<00:00:37.660> 2,500<00:00:38.660> volts<00:00:39.110> on<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.740> unit<00:00:40.450> clear

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
inject 2,500 volts on this unit clear

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.190 
inject 2,500 volts on this unit clear
fire<00:00:44.470> for<00:00:45.470> about<00:00:45.590> 10<00:00:45.860> seconds<00:00:46.310> and<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
fire for about 10 seconds and in the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.340 
fire for about 10 seconds and in the
event<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.100> there<00:00:49.280> is<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.489> short<00:00:49.880> then<00:00:50.660> what's

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
event that there is a short then what's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.380 
event that there is a short then what's
gonna<00:00:51.470> happen<00:00:51.560> is<00:00:51.950> that<00:00:52.220> it'll<00:00:52.760> beep<00:00:53.030> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
gonna happen is that it'll beep and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.370 
gonna happen is that it'll beep and
it'll<00:00:53.809> stop<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.079> test<00:00:55.570> once<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:56.989> test<00:00:57.260> is

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
it'll stop the test once this test is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.530 
it'll stop the test once this test is
done<00:00:57.620> then<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.790> gives<00:00:59.000> us<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.390> authority

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
done then now it gives us the authority

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.720 
done then now it gives us the authority
to<00:01:00.410> be<00:01:00.530> able<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.739> go<00:01:00.890> ahead<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.130> put<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> ul

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
to be able to go ahead and put a ul

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.229 
to be able to go ahead and put a ul
label<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:02.719> back<00:01:03.200> of<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.410> unit<00:01:03.770> so<00:01:04.699> that<00:01:04.969> now

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
label on back of the unit so that now

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.890 
label on back of the unit so that now
it's<00:01:05.899> basically<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.710> person<00:01:07.190> at<00:01:07.460> home<00:01:07.900> will

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
it's basically a person at home will

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.560 
it's basically a person at home will
never<00:01:09.380> get<00:01:09.560> shot<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:11.000> last<00:01:11.180> part<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.450> the

then<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.730> will<00:02:15.970> be<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> master<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
then one will be the master and the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
then one will be the master and the
other<00:02:17.050> one<00:02:17.230> will<00:02:17.350> be<00:02:17.470> set<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.830> slave<00:02:23.820> as

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
other one will be set to the slave as

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.840 
other one will be set to the slave as
you<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.030> see<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.780> unit<00:02:26.020> path<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.070> green

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
you can see the unit path the green

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.650 
you can see the unit path the green
basically<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.500> curve<00:02:30.400> itself<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
basically is the curve itself and the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.930 
basically is the curve itself and the
red<00:02:31.930> are<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> lower<00:02:33.190> limit<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> height

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
red are the lower limit of the height

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.290 
red are the lower limit of the height
limit<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.690> next<00:02:34.900> part<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> process<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.800> to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
limit the next part of the process is to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.730 
limit the next part of the process is to
calibrate<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.570> unit<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.110> she's<00:02:38.380> already

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
calibrate the unit so she's already

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.970 
calibrate the unit so she's already
performing<00:02:39.490> calibration<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.200> ro<00:02:41.410> which

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
performing calibration on the a ro which

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.340 
performing calibration on the a ro which
is<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> automatic<00:02:42.670> room<00:02:43.180> optimization<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
is the automatic room optimization and

is the automatic room optimization and
the<00:02:44.920> whole<00:02:45.070> idea<00:02:45.310> behind<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.030> now

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the whole idea behind this is that now

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.100 
the whole idea behind this is that now

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.430 

as<00:03:30.790> we're<00:03:31.030> looking<00:03:31.210> at<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.990> substrate

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
as we're looking at for the substrate

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
as we're looking at for the substrate
material<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:33.580> basically<00:03:34.450> break<00:03:34.750> apart<00:03:35.140> in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
material to basically break apart in

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.210 
material to basically break apart in
other<00:03:36.280> words<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.940> magnet<00:03:37.330> itself<00:03:37.650> versus<00:03:38.650> the

other words the magnet itself versus the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.830 
other words the magnet itself versus the
adhesive<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.240> integrity<00:03:40.600> of<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
adhesive so the integrity of the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.990 
adhesive so the integrity of the
adhesive<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:42.310> working<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.700> way<00:03:42.730> that's

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
adhesive is working the way that's

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.630 
adhesive is working the way that's
supposed<00:03:43.300> to

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
supposed to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.540 
supposed to
it<00:03:45.640> was<00:03:45.760> fourteen<00:03:46.300> thousand<00:03:46.780> pounds<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.560> force

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
it was fourteen thousand pounds of force

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.430 
it was fourteen thousand pounds of force
to<00:03:48.790> push<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:49.570> apart<00:03:49.810> now<00:03:50.140> let's<00:03:50.350> go

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
to push that one apart now let's go

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.690 
to push that one apart now let's go
ahead<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.680> take<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.800> look<00:03:50.950> at<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.220> what

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
ahead and take a look at the what

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.780 
ahead and take a look at the what
happened<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:59.380> as<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.620> can<00:03:59.710> see<00:03:59.770> what<00:04:00.490> shatter

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
happened and as you can see what shatter

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.180 
happened and as you can see what shatter
what's<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.750> magnet<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.800> not<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
what's the magnet is so it's not the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.790 
what's the magnet is so it's not the
adhesive<00:04:03.730> nothing<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:05.020> we<00:04:05.140> now<00:04:05.290> know<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.710> the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
adhesive nothing so we now know that the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.610 
adhesive nothing so we now know that the
adhesive<00:04:05.920> did<00:04:06.370> not<00:04:06.490> fail<00:04:08.310> Wow<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:11.200> daily

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
adhesive did not fail Wow on a daily

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.430 
adhesive did not fail Wow on a daily
basis<00:04:12.070> we'll<00:04:12.610> go<00:04:12.760> ahead<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.060> push<00:04:13.270> apart<00:04:13.630> two

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
basis we'll go ahead and push apart two

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.470 
basis we'll go ahead and push apart two
motors<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:15.040> ensure<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.880> assembly<00:04:16.390> of

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
motors to ensure that the assembly of

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.440 
motors to ensure that the assembly of
the<00:04:16.600> motor<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.739> adhesive<00:04:17.950> itself<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.670> was

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
the motor and the adhesive itself it was

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.530 
the motor and the adhesive itself it was
working<00:04:19.989> properly<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.640> this<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.360> the
