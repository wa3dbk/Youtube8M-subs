it is then our guys on our m/45 tracking
mount<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.930> 180<00:01:55.530> inch<00:01:55.740> lenses<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
mount with 180 inch lenses on it got it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
mount with 180 inch lenses on it got it
and<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.140> big<00:01:58.290> bu<00:01:58.590> telescope<00:01:59.100> swung<00:01:59.430> over<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and the big bu telescope swung over and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.550 
and the big bu telescope swung over and
got<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.689> followed<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
got it and we followed the thing and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.719 
got it and we followed the thing and
sure<00:02:01.680> enough<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.340> all<00:02:02.460> three

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
sure enough we could see all three

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
sure enough we could see all three
stages<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.240> powered<00:02:03.509> Flyers<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.960> burned<00:02:04.170> out

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
stages of powered Flyers they burned out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
stages of powered Flyers they burned out
and<00:02:04.409> dropped<00:02:04.649> away<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> course<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and dropped away and then of course to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
and dropped away and then of course to
our<00:02:06.540> naked<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.079> always<00:02:07.439> thought<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
our naked I always thought it was a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.140 
our naked I always thought it was a
smoke<00:02:08.940> trail<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.509> off<00:02:09.690> into<00:02:10.700> subspace<00:02:11.700> as

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
smoke trail going off into subspace as

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.970 
smoke trail going off into subspace as
it<00:02:12.300> hit<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
it hit it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.229 
it hit it
toward<00:02:13.190> its<00:02:13.310> target<00:02:13.370> which<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:13.940> Annie<00:02:14.060> we

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
toward its target which was Annie we

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.040 
toward its target which was Annie we
talked<00:02:14.480> Island<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.080> he<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.379> talked<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.800> all<00:02:17.050> so

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
talked Island and he we talked at all so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.470 
talked Island and he we talked at all so
we<00:02:18.200> what<00:02:18.530> beating<00:02:18.830> shouted<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.580> heard<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
we what beating shouted and heard the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.839 
we what beating shouted and heard the
film<00:02:20.690> rap<00:02:20.959> off<00:02:21.230> in<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.730> BU

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
telescope and figured well that was our

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.199 
telescope and figured well that was our
first<00:02:26.360> big<00:02:26.629> deal<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.080> got<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.940> sent<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
first big deal we got it we sent the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.949 
first big deal we got it we sent the
film<00:02:29.390> back<00:02:29.569> down<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.989> Vandenberg<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.959> don't

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
film back down to Vandenberg and I don't

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.080 
film back down to Vandenberg and I don't
know<00:02:33.170> exactly<00:02:33.680> how<00:02:33.890> long<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.370> was<00:02:34.489> after<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
know exactly how long it was after the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.390 
know exactly how long it was after the
the<00:02:35.390> event<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.530> might<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.769> been<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> day<00:02:37.160> or

shot a beam of light at the warhead

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.960 
shot a beam of light at the warhead
which<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.239> represented<00:03:50.750> by<00:03:50.780> my<00:03:50.959> thumb<00:03:51.139> here

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
which is represented by my thumb here

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.490 
which is represented by my thumb here
now<00:03:52.970> remember<00:03:53.480> all<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.750> stuff<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.049> flying<00:03:54.260> at

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
now remember all this stuff is flying at

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.559 
now remember all this stuff is flying at
several<00:03:54.920> thousand<00:03:55.250> miles<00:03:55.370> an<00:03:55.549> hour<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.420> this

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
several thousand miles an hour so this

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.000 
several thousand miles an hour so this
thing<00:03:56.750> fires<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.200> beam<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.590> light<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
thing fires a beam of light at the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.400 
thing fires a beam of light at the
warhead<00:03:58.040> hits<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.120> then<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.170> thing

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
warhead hits it and then this thing

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.500 
warhead hits it and then this thing
flies<00:04:00.709> up<00:04:00.980> like<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.459> meanwhile<00:04:02.209> we're<00:04:02.389> all

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
flies up like this meanwhile we're all

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.240 
flies up like this meanwhile we're all
going<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.139> fires<00:04:03.680> another<00:04:03.920> beam<00:04:04.220> of

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
going like this fires another beam of

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.940 
going like this fires another beam of
light<00:04:04.549> goes<00:04:05.389> around<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.139> we're<00:04:06.739> going

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
light goes around like this we're going

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.319 
light goes around like this we're going
like<00:04:07.099> this<00:04:07.220> fires<00:04:07.579> another<00:04:07.790> beam<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.090> light

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
like this fires another beam of light

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.970 
like this fires another beam of light
goes<00:04:08.660> down<00:04:08.870> like<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.230> far<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.560> another<00:04:09.799> beam

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
goes down like this far is another beam

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.710 
goes down like this far is another beam
of<00:04:10.010> light<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.549> then<00:04:10.609> flies<00:04:11.030> out<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.359> way<00:04:11.599> it

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
of light and then flies out the way it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.580 
of light and then flies out the way it
came<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> warhead<00:04:14.139> tumbles<00:04:15.139> out<00:04:15.440> of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
came in and the warhead tumbles out of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.599 
came in and the warhead tumbles out of
the<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.859> space

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609
