your mind now let's talk about the
actual<00:01:18.020> contrast<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.160> video<00:01:19.580> processing

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
actual contrast the video processing

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.780 
actual contrast the video processing
this<00:01:20.600> maybe<00:01:20.810> actually<00:01:21.080> uses<00:01:21.380> 14<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:21.980> pixel

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
this maybe actually uses 14 bit pixel

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.480 
this maybe actually uses 14 bit pixel
pure<00:01:23.210> digital<00:01:23.870> video<00:01:24.590> processing<00:01:25.130> what<00:01:25.340> that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
pure digital video processing what that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.520 
pure digital video processing what that
means<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.970> is<00:01:26.150> an<00:01:26.630> advanced<00:01:27.170> digital

back light intensity giving you really
fantastic<00:01:53.900> contrast<00:01:54.320> I'd<00:01:54.440> be<00:01:54.560> 5<00:01:54.920> times<00:01:55.490> higher

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
fantastic contrast I'd be 5 times higher

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.260 
fantastic contrast I'd be 5 times higher
than<00:01:56.570> other<00:01:56.780> HD<00:01:57.409> TVs<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.490> it's<00:01:58.610> increasing<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
than other HD TVs so it's increasing the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.660 
than other HD TVs so it's increasing the
details<00:01:59.720> increasing<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.380> depth<00:02:00.680> even<00:02:01.280> in

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
details increasing the depth even in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.310 
details increasing the depth even in
low-light<00:02:02.030> environment<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.080> if<00:02:03.140> you're

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
low-light environment so if you're

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.899

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
going on in great detail in those

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.890 
going on in great detail in those
shadows<00:02:10.310> now<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.270> also<00:02:11.420> has<00:02:11.540> what<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.870> called

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
shadows now it also has what is called

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.840 
shadows now it also has what is called
cine<00:02:12.260> speed<00:02:12.590> response<00:02:13.190> time

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
cine speed response time

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.580 
cine speed response time
what<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.180> basically<00:02:14.300> means<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:15.170> enables

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
what that basically means it enables

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.560 
what that basically means it enables
your<00:02:15.770> television<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.730> actually<00:02:17.030> respond<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.420> 8

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
your television to actually respond in 8

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.140 
your television to actually respond in 8
milliseconds<00:02:18.050> or<00:02:18.620> faster<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.940> know<00:02:20.030> when

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
milliseconds or faster so you know when

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.340 
milliseconds or faster so you know when
you<00:02:20.210> watch<00:02:20.330> TV<00:02:20.540> sometimes<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.110> get<00:02:21.230> that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
you watch TV sometimes you get that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.680 
you watch TV sometimes you get that
digital<00:02:21.920> blotches<00:02:22.490> as<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.820> were<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.390> baby

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
digital blotches as it were this baby

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.450 
digital blotches as it were this baby
with<00:02:23.900> 8<00:02:24.050> milliseconds<00:02:24.590> or<00:02:24.770> faster<00:02:25.310> is

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
with 8 milliseconds or faster is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.800 
with 8 milliseconds or faster is
actually<00:02:25.910> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> avoid<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.630> all

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
actually going to avoid that all
