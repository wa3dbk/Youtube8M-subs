00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
right now I believes a 92 overall roll

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.370 
right now I believes a 92 overall roll
to<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.860> playoff<00:05:25.250> card<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:26.720> does<00:05:27.020> suck

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
to the playoff card and that does suck

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.990 
to the playoff card and that does suck
because<00:05:27.650> if<00:05:27.860> he's<00:05:28.160> your<00:05:28.310> favorite<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.880> you

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
because if he's your favorite and you

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.880 
because if he's your favorite and you
want<00:05:29.210> him<00:05:29.390> on<00:05:29.420> your<00:05:29.570> legacy<00:05:30.050> team<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.650> want

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.200 
to talk pink matting on your quarterback
that<00:05:36.170> would<00:05:36.290> ruin<00:05:36.470> your<00:05:36.650> overall<00:05:37.100> score<00:05:37.210> so

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
that does suck there is a drawback there

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.490 
that does suck there is a drawback there
but<00:05:40.700> there's<00:05:40.970> still<00:05:41.060> like<00:05:41.450> two<00:05:41.930> months<00:05:42.110> like<00:05:42.380> I

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
but there's still like two months like I

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.580 
but there's still like two months like I
said<00:05:42.770> until<00:05:43.760> august<00:05:44.390> 15<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.170> still<00:05:45.470> have

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
said until august 15 so you still have

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.080 
said until august 15 so you still have
two<00:05:45.740> months<00:05:45.920> to<00:05:46.070> build<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.610> if<00:05:46.760> they<00:05:46.910> keep

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
two months to build and if they keep

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.450
