00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
if I'd have had the benefit of having me

if I'd have had the benefit of having me
on<00:01:55.530> revenge<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> few<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> few<00:01:57.210> weeks<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on revenge for a few for a few weeks to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
on revenge for a few for a few weeks to
a<00:01:57.659> month<00:01:57.689> perhaps<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.939> would<00:01:59.939> probably<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a month perhaps I would probably be a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.859 
a month perhaps I would probably be a
lot<00:02:01.140> more<00:02:01.850> better<00:02:02.850> planned<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.719> be

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
lot more better planned I think would be

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.690 
lot more better planned I think would be
the<00:02:03.899> case

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the case

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.099 
the case
anyway<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.299> thought<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.929> see

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
anyway so there you go thought if I see

we<00:02:26.640> use<00:02:26.819> them<00:02:27.349> so<00:02:28.349> I've<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.920> max<00:02:29.489> rage<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
we use them so I've got to max rage and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.630 
we use them so I've got to max rage and
one<00:02:30.959> heel<00:02:31.349> heels<00:02:31.890> only<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.190> level<00:02:32.310> three<00:02:32.610> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
one heel heels only a level three I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.240 
one heel heels only a level three I
don't<00:02:32.879> really<00:02:33.120> use<00:02:33.959> feel<00:02:34.200> very<00:02:34.440> much<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
don't really use feel very much so you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.890 
don't really use feel very much so you
know<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.370> haven't<00:02:35.519> maxed<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.970> yet<00:02:36.239> though<00:02:36.750> it's

know I haven't maxed out yet though it's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.550 
know I haven't maxed out yet though it's
on<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.079> list<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> I'm<00:02:39.329> thinking<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:40.319> know<00:02:40.440> the

with good air defense of balloons

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
with good air defense of balloons
probably<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.099> right<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.090> why<00:02:45.269> don't

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
probably on the right thing so why don't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
probably on the right thing so why don't
we<00:02:45.480> try<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.440> trigger<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> air<00:02:46.920> defense<00:02:47.220> with

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the minute means some to the air bombs

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.729 
the minute means some to the air bombs
and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:51.720> move<00:02:51.900> your<00:02:51.989> throwing<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.379> Dragons

and then move your throwing the Dragons
throw<00:02:53.340> some<00:02:53.549> rage<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.650> then<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.549> balloons

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
problems and it does seem a bit like

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.180 
problems and it does seem a bit like
overkill<00:04:48.930> doesn't<00:04:49.230> it<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:49.530> hey<00:04:49.650> he<00:04:49.920> had<00:04:50.040> the

overkill doesn't it but hey he had the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.450 
overkill doesn't it but hey he had the
money<00:04:50.310> he<00:04:50.610> gets<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:50.880> honey<00:04:51.920> let's<00:04:52.920> throw<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.250> a

money he gets the honey let's throw in a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.390 
money he gets the honey let's throw in a
few<00:04:53.730> millions<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.890> fence<00:04:56.070> is<00:04:56.220> there

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400

so<00:05:08.020> well<00:05:08.770> it's<00:05:09.189> pretty<00:05:09.639> much<00:05:09.729> a<00:05:09.819> four-game

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
so well it's pretty much a four-game

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
conclusion really isn't it we're going

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.080 
conclusion really isn't it we're going
to<00:05:12.039> go<00:05:12.699> to<00:05:12.729> win<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:15.430> hey<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> thought<00:05:15.849> you<00:05:15.969> might

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
to go to win but hey I thought you might

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.290

for you know let's not try this at home

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.149 
for you know let's not try this at home
because<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.430> quite<00:05:21.580> expensive<00:05:22.409> perhaps<00:05:23.409> you
