in<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.399> gyroscopes<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.390> guys

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
in you know gyroscopes we have our guys

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.289 
in you know gyroscopes we have our guys
are<00:01:10.289> gonna<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.649> fun<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.940> together

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
to attack so those will adjust ourselves

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.170 
to attack so those will adjust ourselves
turn<00:01:53.969> ourselves<00:01:54.119> around

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180
