another<00:00:19.230> use<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.039> test<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.820> command

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
another use for the test for command

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
another use for the test for command
okay<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.609> I'm<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
okay so I'm actually going to use a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.339 
okay so I'm actually going to use a
remote<00:00:25.310> detonation<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:27.210> TNT<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
remote detonation of some TNT for the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
remote detonation of some TNT for the
come<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
come on so what you see here is this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.470 
come on so what you see here is this
poor<00:00:30.990> little<00:00:31.140> village<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:32.009> been<00:00:32.399> overrun<00:00:33.270> by

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
poor little village has been overrun by

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
poor little village has been overrun by
zombies<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.340> stop<00:00:35.730> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
zombies and we have to stop this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
zombies and we have to stop this
infection<00:00:36.750> straight<00:00:37.530> away<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.219> stop

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
infection straight away if we don't stop

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
infection straight away if we don't stop
this<00:00:38.550> infection<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> will<00:00:39.360> spread<00:00:39.719> it'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

I'm going to do is we have our emergency

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.840 
I'm going to do is we have our emergency
procedure<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:51.420> over<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.520> okay<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
procedure one right over here okay you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
procedure one right over here okay you
will<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.390> absolutely<00:00:55.350> no<00:00:56.030> redstone

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
will see there is absolutely no redstone

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.700 
will see there is absolutely no redstone
wiring<00:00:58.640> connected<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.539> device<00:01:01.199> over

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
wiring connected to this device over

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
wiring connected to this device over
here<00:01:01.949> okay<00:01:02.640> no<00:01:03.000> redstone<00:01:03.480> wiring<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.290> all

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
here okay no redstone wiring at all all

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.000 
here okay no redstone wiring at all all
it<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> command<00:01:06.630> block<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.320> says<00:01:07.590> test

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it is is a command block that says test

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.450 
it is is a command block that says test
for<00:01:08.340> any<00:01:08.630> players<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.220> minimum

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
for any players that is the minimum

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.260 
for any players that is the minimum
level<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.619> 911<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:14.220> 911<00:01:15.470> right<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.240> with<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
level of 911 or 911 right so with this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
level of 911 or 911 right so with this
clock<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.930> constantly<00:01:19.470> checks<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.950> there's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
clock it constantly checks if there's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.450 
clock it constantly checks if there's
any<00:01:20.280> players<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.970> 911<00:01:21.450> experience<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.500> there

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
any players with 911 experience if there

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
any players with 911 experience if there
is<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.360> set<00:01:24.689> off<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.439> comparator

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is it will then set off this comparator

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
is it will then set off this comparator
which<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.759> turn<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.270> torch<00:01:28.520> which

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
which will turn off this torch which

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.210 
which will turn off this torch which
will<00:01:29.790> turn<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:31.290> torches<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:32.070> will

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
will turn on these torches which will

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
will turn on these torches which will
drop<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.549> TNT<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
drop this TNT into this and then in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.940 
drop this TNT into this and then in
theory<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.640> should<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.780> big<00:01:37.229> bang

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
theory we should get a pretty big bang

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
theory we should get a pretty big bang
ok<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.110> let<00:01:40.110> us<00:01:40.290> save<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.579> world<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.500> other

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
ok so let us save the world on the other

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
ok so let us save the world on the other
end<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.549> anywhere<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
end now this can be anywhere in the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
end now this can be anywhere in the
world<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.810> long<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.140> both<00:01:46.439> chunks<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.100> loaded

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
world as long as both chunks are loaded

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
world as long as both chunks are loaded
it<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.659> much<00:01:48.869> anywhere<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it can be pretty much anywhere in the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
it can be pretty much anywhere in the
world<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.340> command<00:01:50.729> block<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.210> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
world I have one command block it just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.020 
world I have one command block it just
says<00:01:51.720> give<00:01:52.380> XP<00:01:53.360> 911<00:01:54.360> levels<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.560> any<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
says give XP 911 levels to any all the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.819 
says give XP 911 levels to any all the
closest<00:01:57.509> players<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> bed

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
closest players and just take a bed

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
closest players and just take a bed
space<00:01:59.130> thing<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.880> closest<00:02:00.299> player<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.229> all

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
space thing to the closest player so all

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
space thing to the closest player so all
I<00:02:01.409> need<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.770> press<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.640> button<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I need to do press this button it's a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120 
I need to do press this button it's a
flag<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> top<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.890> should

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
flag the one at the top and we should

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.059 
flag the one at the top and we should
see<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.689> bangs<00:02:06.689> happening<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.500> let's<00:02:07.740> see

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
see some bangs happening so let's see
