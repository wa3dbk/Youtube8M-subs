00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.940
 tomahawk as it takes fatal is not that 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.440

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.440

 impossible to know that I'm running 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.769
 we do not know tactical insertion 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.090
 17 was very little really x and if 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.490
 you're here I'm right in front of you I come 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.230
 look at the height I'm in 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.500
 small baltra and you failed like 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.030
 by my side 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.800
 parker but not to kill you do not have to see 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.600
 the images the best we can do 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
 but what if half a point to zero 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.890
 to the 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.890
 they were ready 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.020
 at this height 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.280
 the dragon is near 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.499
 I'm seeing myself 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.229
 I do not know I do not know if I should leave as in 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:20.069
 marker 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:20.069
 quintile valley they did not have red 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.550
 over here no no no 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.220
 if he killed him 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.630
 we are in a piece tied half a point 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.850
 half a point we are tied 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.800
 who pete good as we have 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.420
 tied at midpoint now what 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.010
 we're going to do is make a jump-off 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.360
 between dragons because it's been clear 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.670
 that the dragon can more than san jorge 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.380
 so we rewrote the story here and 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.500
 it is a dragon to fail against the other of 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:04.360

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:07.320
