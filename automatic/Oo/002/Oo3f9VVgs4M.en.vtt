though<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:03.609> only<00:01:03.910> letdown<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.870> its<00:01:05.170> speed<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
though it's only letdown is its speed it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920 
though it's only letdown is its speed it
can<00:01:08.800> very<00:01:09.070> easily<00:01:09.160> be<00:01:09.550> remedied<00:01:09.910> with<00:01:10.540> thunder

can very easily be remedied with thunder

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.899 
can very easily be remedied with thunder
wave<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:13.020> anyways<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:17.070> its<00:01:18.070> typing<00:01:18.670> is

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
wave so anyways the its typing is

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.789 
wave so anyways the its typing is
electric<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:21.840> even<00:01:22.840> though<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.290> it's<00:01:23.530> weak

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
electric and even though that it's weak

levitate<00:01:27.009> completely<00:01:27.490> nullifies<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.990> it's

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
levitate completely nullifies it so it's

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.429 
levitate completely nullifies it so it's
essentially<00:01:30.549> like<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:31.030> Sableye<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.079> spear

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
breaker and its stat layout as I said

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.910

before<00:01:45.729> it's<00:01:46.060> really<00:01:46.119> decent<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.990> mean<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.799> has

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
before it's really decent I mean it has

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
defense so it can take some hits when

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.190 
defense so it can take some hits when
you<00:01:52.840> absolutely<00:01:52.990> need<00:01:53.469> it<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:54.180> its<00:01:55.180> base<00:01:55.479> 115

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
possibilities for it and its base speed

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.719 
possibilities for it and its base speed
yeah<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.409> pretty<00:02:05.409> low<00:02:05.619> 50<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.609> know

of<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.900> gimmick<00:05:26.140> for<00:05:27.270> Electress<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.570> guess<00:05:28.720> in

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
of a gimmick for Electress I guess in

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.580 
of a gimmick for Electress I guess in
this<00:05:29.050> case<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.750> nature<00:05:32.170> is<00:05:32.230> going<00:05:32.350> to<00:05:32.440> be

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
this case the nature is going to be

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.610 
this case the nature is going to be
careful<00:05:33.160> so<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:34.870> decreases<00:05:35.500> your

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
careful so that it decreases your

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.170 
careful so that it decreases your
Special<00:05:36.160> Attack<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:36.460> increases<00:05:37.150> your

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
Special Attack and increases your

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.420 
Special Attack and increases your

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
special defense items going to be

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.140 
special defense items going to be
leftovers<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.090> increase<00:05:40.450> survivability<00:05:42.150> as

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
leftovers to increase survivability as

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.530 
leftovers to increase survivability as
for<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.480> eby's<00:05:43.810> 252<00:05:44.590> or<00:05:44.800> going<00:05:45.010> into<00:05:45.160> HP<00:05:45.540> 252

just to give you that one more point now
as<00:05:51.100> for<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.370> moves<00:05:52.800> we<00:05:53.800> have<00:05:54.010> aqua<00:05:54.550> tail<00:05:54.760> which

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
as for the moves we have aqua tail which

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.170 
as for the moves we have aqua tail which
is<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.180> very<00:05:55.480> good<00:05:55.780> water<00:05:56.050> type<00:05:56.410> attack<00:05:56.880> but<00:05:57.880> it

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
is a very good water type attack but it

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.120 
is a very good water type attack but it
is<00:05:59.100> somewhat<00:06:00.100> inaccurate<00:06:00.670> and<00:06:01.860> again<00:06:02.860> there's

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
is somewhat inaccurate and again there's

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.450 
is somewhat inaccurate and again there's
a<00:06:03.220> B<00:06:03.490> to<00:06:03.700> W<00:06:04.060> two<00:06:04.150> brackets<00:06:04.660> around<00:06:04.780> it

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
a B to W two brackets around it

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.720 
a B to W two brackets around it
same<00:06:07.300> with<00:06:07.450> iron<00:06:07.750> tail<00:06:08.080> it's<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.980> very<00:06:09.370> strong

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
same with iron tail it's a very strong

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.190 
same with iron tail it's a very strong
steel<00:06:10.120> type<00:06:10.420> attack<00:06:10.780> but<00:06:11.200> it<00:06:11.920> also<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:13.200> pretty

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
steel type attack but it also is pretty

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.150 
steel type attack but it also is pretty
inaccurate<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:16.300> too<00:06:16.840> has<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.170> B<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:17.740> w2

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
inaccurate and it too has the B to w2

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.930 
inaccurate and it too has the B to w2
brackets<00:06:18.790> around<00:06:18.910> it<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:20.400> we<00:06:21.400> have<00:06:21.520> dragon

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
brackets around it and we have dragon

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.590 
brackets around it and we have dragon
tail<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.330> basically<00:06:22.720> phase<00:06:23.470> out<00:06:23.800> your

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
tail to basically phase out your

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.200 
tail to basically phase out your
opponent's<00:06:25.600> or<00:06:26.070> rack<00:06:27.070> up<00:06:27.310> hazard<00:06:27.730> damage<00:06:28.060> if

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
you have any on the field and coil

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.610 
you have any on the field and coil
basically<00:06:31.450> ties<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.900> all<00:06:31.990> in<00:06:32.230> together

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.950 

boosting<00:06:35.620> your<00:06:36.130> attack<00:06:36.850> defense<00:06:37.780> and

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
boosting your attack defense and

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.850 
boosting your attack defense and
accuracy<00:06:38.650> all<00:06:38.860> by<00:06:39.100> one<00:06:39.310> stage<00:06:39.750> so<00:06:40.750> after<00:06:41.650> one

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
accuracy all by one stage so after one

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.920 
accuracy all by one stage so after one
coil<00:06:42.250> all<00:06:42.810> three<00:06:43.810> of<00:06:44.110> your<00:06:44.820> tail<00:06:45.820> moves<00:06:46.450> are

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
coil all three of your tail moves are

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.119 
coil all three of your tail moves are
gonna<00:06:47.380> be

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
gonna be

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.399 
gonna be
hitting<00:06:48.819> pretty<00:06:49.419> much<00:06:49.599> 100%<00:06:50.409> of<00:06:50.499> the<00:06:50.589> time<00:06:52.409> and

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
hitting pretty much 100% of the time and

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.279 
hitting pretty much 100% of the time and
I'd<00:06:53.529> like<00:06:53.619> to<00:06:53.709> say<00:06:53.949> that<00:06:54.159> this<00:06:54.339> is<00:06:54.580> a<00:06:55.289> pretty

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
I'd like to say that this is a pretty

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.799 
I'd like to say that this is a pretty
funny<00:06:57.330> but<00:06:58.330> could<00:06:59.050> possibly<00:06:59.589> work<00:07:00.489> out<00:07:00.819> very

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:01.809 
funny but could possibly work out very

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:05.219 
funny but could possibly work out very
nicely<00:07:02.110> kind<00:07:02.679> of<00:07:02.800> set<00:07:03.039> I<00:07:03.959> really<00:07:04.959> don't<00:07:05.169> have

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
nicely kind of set I really don't have

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.279 
nicely kind of set I really don't have
anything<00:07:05.559> else<00:07:05.800> to<00:07:05.949> say<00:07:06.489> or<00:07:07.149> anything<00:07:07.869> witty
