settings<00:05:46.990> on<00:05:47.560> my<00:05:47.590> computer<00:05:48.220> uh<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.930> try<00:05:50.110> to

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
settings on my computer uh to try to

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.040 
settings on my computer uh to try to
make<00:05:50.349> it<00:05:50.520> record<00:05:51.520> faster<00:05:52.120> but<00:05:52.539> it's<00:05:52.810> not<00:05:53.020> i

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
make it record faster but it's not i

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.690 
make it record faster but it's not i
just<00:05:53.590> don't<00:05:53.770> have<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.039> processing<00:05:54.580> speed

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
just don't have the processing speed

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.570 
just don't have the processing speed
apparently<00:05:55.360> apparently<00:05:56.020> 2.5<00:05:56.800> gigahertz<00:05:57.160> is

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
apparently apparently 2.5 gigahertz is

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.000 
apparently apparently 2.5 gigahertz is
not<00:05:57.880> enough<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.630> run<00:05:58.840> Minecraft<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.530> fraps<00:05:59.830> at

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
not enough to run Minecraft and fraps at

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.070 
not enough to run Minecraft and fraps at
the<00:06:00.070> same<00:06:00.250> time<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:00.849> I<00:06:01.539> think<00:06:01.720> that's<00:06:01.840> kind<00:06:02.020> of

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
the same time and I think that's kind of

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.629 
the same time and I think that's kind of
bullshit<00:06:02.440> because<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.919> game<00:06:03.130> is<00:06:03.310> made<00:06:03.460> up

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
bullshit because the game is made up

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.270 
bullshit because the game is made up
entirely<00:06:03.940> of<00:06:04.120> fucking<00:06:04.539> blocks<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.919> think

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
entirely of fucking blocks you think

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.440 
entirely of fucking blocks you think
that<00:06:06.430> that<00:06:06.580> would<00:06:06.669> make<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:06.880> difference<00:06:06.970> but

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
that that would make a difference but

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.270 
that that would make a difference but
apparently<00:06:07.840> it<00:06:07.930> makes<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.260> run<00:06:08.470> like<00:06:09.070> I<00:06:09.130> can

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
apparently it makes it run like I can

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.820 
apparently it makes it run like I can
run<00:06:09.460> crysis<00:06:10.240> on<00:06:10.450> my<00:06:10.570> computer<00:06:10.990> no<00:06:11.169> problem<00:06:11.710> but

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
run crysis on my computer no problem but

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.089 
run crysis on my computer no problem but
as<00:06:11.919> soon<00:06:12.039> as<00:06:12.160> I<00:06:12.250> pop<00:06:12.400> in<00:06:12.610> Minecraft<00:06:13.090> it's<00:06:13.810> like

as soon as I pop in Minecraft it's like

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.500 
as soon as I pop in Minecraft it's like
30<00:06:15.099> frames<00:06:15.400> per<00:06:15.520> second<00:06:16.030> if<00:06:16.150> I'm<00:06:16.389> lucky
