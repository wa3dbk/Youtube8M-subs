00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
rods will have that similar thing there

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.520 
rods will have that similar thing there
of<00:01:27.820> what<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:28.119> rod<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.539> medium<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.380> light

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530

long and rods have can handle two to ten
pound<00:01:36.159> tests<00:01:36.429> probably<00:01:36.670> would<00:01:37.270> be<00:01:37.420> your

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
pound tests probably would be your

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.800 
pound tests probably would be your
inside<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.710> outside<00:01:38.829> ranges<00:01:39.429> now<00:01:40.299> along<00:01:40.780> with

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
inside and outside ranges now along with

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.429 
inside and outside ranges now along with
that<00:01:41.109> rod<00:01:41.439> it's<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.219> very<00:01:42.429> light<00:01:42.609> rod<00:01:43.439> you're

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
that rod it's a very light rod you're

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.200 
that rod it's a very light rod you're
gonna<00:01:44.590> want<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> reel<00:01:45.130> more<00:01:45.640> or<00:01:45.700> less<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.030> match

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
gonna want to reel more or less to match

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.209 
gonna want to reel more or less to match
so<00:01:46.509> you're<00:01:46.929> not<00:01:47.049> gonna<00:01:47.289> buy<00:01:47.499> a<00:01:47.530> really<00:01:47.979> big

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
so you're not gonna buy a really big

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.090 
so you're not gonna buy a really big
large<00:01:48.579> spinning<00:01:49.479> type<00:01:49.810> reel<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.350> spinning

what they call your softer lines they

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.740 
what they call your softer lines they
lay<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.460> limp<00:02:59.640> or<00:02:59.850> they<00:03:00.240> come<00:03:00.450> off<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
lay a little limp or they come off the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.390 
lay a little limp or they come off the
reel<00:03:00.930> nicer<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.740> become<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.220> don't

have<00:03:02.580> memory<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.090> them<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.530> doesn't

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
have memory in them and so it doesn't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
have memory in them and so it doesn't
come<00:03:04.890> off<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> coil<00:03:05.610> spring<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
come off like a coil spring that is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.200 
come off like a coil spring that is
actually<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.860> key<00:03:08.190> ingredient<00:03:08.790> when

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
actually a really key ingredient when

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.790 
actually a really key ingredient when
using<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> spinning<00:03:09.900> rod<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.320> fishing<00:03:10.650> was

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
using a spinning rod and fishing was

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.050 
using a spinning rod and fishing was
like<00:03:10.980> geared<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:11.400> truck

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
like geared for truck

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.580 
like geared for truck
now<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.600> you've<00:03:12.720> picked<00:03:12.930> your<00:03:13.050> rod<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.320> reel

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
now that you've picked your rod and reel

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.470 
now that you've picked your rod and reel
load<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.490> very<00:03:14.700> important<00:03:15.210> when<00:03:15.330> you're

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
load and it's very important when you're

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480 
load and it's very important when you're
choosing<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.930> lines<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.980> you've

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
choosing your lines is that you've

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.790 
choosing your lines is that you've
matched<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.240> line<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.440> rod<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
matched the line and with the rod and

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.560 
matched the line and with the rod and
reel<00:03:19.920> combo<00:03:20.310> like<00:03:20.460> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.300> want

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
reel combo like if you don't really want

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.200 
reel combo like if you don't really want
to<00:03:21.690> over<00:03:22.350> fish<00:03:22.620> your<00:03:23.220> rod<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> rod

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
to over fish your rod like if the rod

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.090 
to over fish your rod like if the rod
calls<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:24.990> i<00:03:25.140> pointed<00:03:25.530> out<00:03:25.620> before<00:03:25.740> on

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
calls and like i pointed out before on

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.810 
calls and like i pointed out before on
the<00:03:26.310> rod

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the rod

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.360 
the rod
it's<00:03:27.300> got<00:03:27.680> approximately<00:03:28.680> what<00:03:28.770> language<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
it's got approximately what language you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.250 
it's got approximately what language you
should<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.700> using<00:03:29.880> while<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.720> only<00:03:30.930> calls

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
should be using while if it only calls
