them to like you communicate it sounds

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.190 
them to like you communicate it sounds
so<00:05:36.520> simple<00:05:36.820> you<00:05:37.120> probably<00:05:37.420> already<00:05:37.660> do<00:05:38.050> it

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
so simple you probably already do it

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.340 
so simple you probably already do it
anyway<00:05:38.590> but<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.490> could<00:05:39.640> probably<00:05:39.670> do<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.350> just

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
anyway but you could probably do it just

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.410 
anyway but you could probably do it just
a<00:05:41.440> little<00:05:41.590> bit<00:05:41.770> better<00:05:41.950> just<00:05:42.310> make<00:05:42.910> a<00:05:42.940> little

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
a little bit better just make a little

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.590 
a little bit better just make a little
bit<00:05:43.600> more<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:43.900> an<00:05:43.990> effort<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:45.600> communicate

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
bit more of an effort to communicate

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.740 
bit more of an effort to communicate
with<00:05:47.020> your<00:05:47.290> clients<00:05:47.730> rather<00:05:48.730> than<00:05:49.060> putting<00:05:49.420> so

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
with your clients rather than putting so

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.680 
with your clients rather than putting so
much<00:05:49.900> effort<00:05:50.140> into<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:51.850> know<00:05:52.000> what<00:05:52.390> equipment

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
much effort into you know what equipment

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.510 
much effort into you know what equipment

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
look good like I said in the end it

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.000 
look good like I said in the end it
really<00:05:57.010> doesn't<00:05:57.670> matter<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:59.350> most<00:05:59.530> people

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
really doesn't matter to most people

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.920 
really doesn't matter to most people

most<00:06:02.460> so<00:06:04.140> that<00:06:05.140> is<00:06:05.470> what<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:05.890> do<00:06:06.660> to<00:06:07.660> get<00:06:07.810> a

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
most so that is what I do to get a

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.690 
most so that is what I do to get a
response<00:06:08.140> like<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.830> toddler<00:06:09.130> at<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.400> start<00:06:09.640> of
