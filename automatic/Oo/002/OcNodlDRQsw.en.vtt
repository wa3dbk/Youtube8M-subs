00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.800
 View is activated when you click 6 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.730
 In the lower right of the screen 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.510
 If you press a mark that is obviously going to get bigger, it gets bigger 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.370
 You can 1 in screen size from 2013 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.780
 To 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.120
 Also to the left it is not just the lower right 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 Or layout 1 screen of the screen 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.750

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.820
 You can switch 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.920

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.870
 Broadly speaking, max 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.309

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.350
 Where the editing function is required , tools and groups 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.350
 Where to create peep 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.260
 Next time axis 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.170
 Next control panel 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.170
 There is something called 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.830
 If the menu such as land to go one by one description 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.830
 Important place 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.270
 It can be called 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.250
 Speaking 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.000
 Oh, if you want to create a polygon model 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.890
 It is a standard primitive form from creation to standard primitive 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.310
 box i 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.310
 In the form of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.530
 You can access from the menu and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.140
 Of the control panel of Thira 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.560
 One is 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.600
 The child of has become the creation panel, but this one becomes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.050
 What I made now when I get into the correction modifier 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.080
 Or 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.340
 now 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.340
 Although it is selected 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.939
 The parameter can be scattered 7 floors 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.020
 For example 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.300
 In this box 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 When we want to buy reference point 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.930
 The better of here right 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.769
 Forwarding 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.769
 Four Tenno influence 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:47.140
 Move this danger as a reference point 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.140
 If you uncheck the impact of danger 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.750
 This box moves from here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.750
 Can than it is in the control panel that tilts from here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.750
 Ne 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.329
 It is this time axis, but time axis is once 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.810
 It will be easy to understand if you switch to auto key mode 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 For example 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:22.580
 From 0/100 to say by moving and hit the slider 100/100 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.580
 Moving 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.830
 1 Because it is time 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 M 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:39.110
 The time axis is by moving the slider here to move as if your mind is struck 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.110
 Besides being able to compose 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.390
 I will change the track and kilometer a little 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.260
 It is not so to say that this one time axis goes only to 100/100 today 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.879
 Time settings 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.879
 End time 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.450
 When you think about it, this 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.290
 It is a panel of the timeline time axis 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.290
 Can be increased 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.519
 If I go back to the menu again 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:21.510

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.670

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.070
 Save in shape 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.600
 Closing outside max 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.050
 Returned to the desktop and saved earlier 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.910

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.950
 I will call it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.850
 There are a few ways to open files, for example 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.390
 Black androp 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.320
 Open the file with 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.180
 But 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.199
 I'm fine 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.199
 It's just a file 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.870
 I will try to open this time politely 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.670
 Reset max once 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.280
