spear and I hit them for about three
hundred<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.050> eighty<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.560> which<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.950> fairly

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
hundred and eighty one which is a fairly

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310 
hundred and eighty one which is a fairly
good<00:03:11.610> amount<00:03:11.910> especially<00:03:12.570> when<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.170> consider

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
good amount especially when you consider

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.190 
good amount especially when you consider
that<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.950> only<00:03:14.220> have<00:03:14.490> 21<00:03:15.000> faith<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.540> believe<00:03:15.930> that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
that I only have 21 faith I believe that

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.140 
that I only have 21 faith I believe that
the<00:03:16.530> lightning<00:03:17.010> portion<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the lightning portion of that or the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.330 
the lightning portion of that or the
special<00:03:18.480> attack<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.440> does<00:03:19.680> scale<00:03:19.950> off<00:03:20.100> your

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
special attack it does scale off your

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.550 
special attack it does scale off your
faith<00:03:20.550> because<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.180> got<00:03:21.720> lightning<00:03:21.990> scaling

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
faith because it's got lightning scaling

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560 
faith because it's got lightning scaling
damage<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.670> um<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.510> see

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
damage but um you know you can see

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.730 
damage but um you know you can see
that's<00:03:24.750> why<00:03:24.870> I'm<00:03:24.990> running<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.380> lightning

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
that's why I'm running the lightning

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.290 
that's why I'm running the lightning
arrows<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.760> adds<00:03:26.910> up<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.270> a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
arrows with this to it adds up to be a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.150 
arrows with this to it adds up to be a
lot<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.600> lightning<00:03:27.870> damage<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.590> when<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
lot of lightning damage and when you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.730 
lot of lightning damage and when you
consider<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.300> tripod<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> lightning

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
consider that it's a tripod of lightning

consider that it's a tripod of lightning
regular<00:03:32.459> magic<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.320> hexes<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.440> they<00:03:35.220> have

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
regular magic and hexes and they have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.860 
regular magic and hexes and they have
kind<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.910> lot<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.240> things<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.540> look<00:03:36.660> out<00:03:36.810> for

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
and then you also add in the pyromancy

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.870 
and then you also add in the pyromancy
to<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.709> one<00:03:40.709> problem<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> fur

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
I lost every one of them mostly because

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.060 
I lost every one of them mostly because
it<00:05:32.280> was<00:05:32.460> either<00:05:32.970> avalons<00:05:33.840> doing<00:05:34.530> about<00:05:34.710> forty

hundred but that's health that's really

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.250 
hundred but that's health that's really
hard<00:05:43.950> to<00:05:44.010> recover<00:05:44.480> especially<00:05:45.480> when<00:05:46.110> you're

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260

here's a nice little I'm tired match
right<00:05:54.120> over<00:05:54.360> there<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:55.020> lot<00:05:55.410> of<00:05:55.470> these<00:05:55.710> hits

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
right over there a lot of these hits

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.580 
right over there a lot of these hits
from<00:05:56.640> any<00:05:56.940> of<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.180> range<00:05:57.390> sources<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.380> can

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
from any of the range sources it can

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.010 
from any of the range sources it can
easily<00:05:58.770> be<00:05:59.040> dodged<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.880> don't<00:06:00.540> feel<00:06:00.690> like<00:06:00.840> I'm

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
easily be dodged I don't feel like I'm

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.320 
easily be dodged I don't feel like I'm
personally<00:06:01.740> skilled<00:06:02.490> enough<00:06:02.730> to<00:06:02.760> do<00:06:03.030> some<00:06:03.240> of

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
personally skilled enough to do some of

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.540 
personally skilled enough to do some of
those<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.720> obviously<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:05.190> can<00:06:05.310> see<00:06:05.460> I'm

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
those and obviously you can see I'm

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.300 
those and obviously you can see I'm
taking<00:06:05.910> some<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.750> know<00:06:06.780> stupid<00:06:07.140> hits<00:06:07.440> but<00:06:08.280> I

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
taking some you know stupid hits but I

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.390 
taking some you know stupid hits but I
feel<00:06:08.610> like<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.910> build<00:06:09.150> is<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.330> really<00:06:09.750> fun<00:06:10.020> and

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
feel like this build is a really fun and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.540 
feel like this build is a really fun and
possibly<00:06:11.400> viable<00:06:12.030> type<00:06:12.420> of<00:06:12.570> build<00:06:12.780> um<00:06:13.170> I<00:06:13.550> am

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
possibly viable type of build um I am

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.660 
possibly viable type of build um I am
only<00:06:14.730> soul<00:06:15.180> level<00:06:15.360> 144<00:06:16.170> and<00:06:16.560> like<00:06:17.370> I<00:06:17.460> said<00:06:17.520> I

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
only soul level 144 and like I said I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.180 
only soul level 144 and like I said I
did<00:06:17.910> start<00:06:18.180> with<00:06:18.450> 11<00:06:19.410> strength<00:06:19.770> because<00:06:20.040> this

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
did start with 11 strength because this

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.580 
did start with 11 strength because this
was<00:06:20.340> previously<00:06:20.640> a<00:06:20.850> melee<00:06:21.210> character<00:06:21.660> so

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
was previously a melee character so

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.430 
was previously a melee character so
there's<00:06:23.100> a<00:06:23.160> lot<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.490> room<00:06:23.760> to<00:06:23.790> optimize<00:06:24.420> but<00:06:25.170> I

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
there's a lot of room to optimize but I

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.080 
there's a lot of room to optimize but I
mean<00:06:25.590> that's<00:06:25.710> up<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:26.040> you<00:06:26.160> guys<00:06:26.220> if<00:06:26.610> you<00:06:26.820> feel

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
mean that's up to you guys if you feel

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.730 
mean that's up to you guys if you feel
like<00:06:27.270> there<00:06:27.720> is<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.870> better<00:06:28.050> build<00:06:28.320> let<00:06:28.500> me<00:06:28.590> know

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
like there is a better build let me know

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.350 
like there is a better build let me know
I<00:06:28.770> can<00:06:29.130> try<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.370> recreate<00:06:29.790> a<00:06:29.880> new<00:06:30.090> character

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
I can try and recreate a new character

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.140 
I can try and recreate a new character
and<00:06:30.750> if<00:06:31.740> there's<00:06:31.950> any<00:06:32.130> other<00:06:32.340> suggestions<00:06:33.030> for
