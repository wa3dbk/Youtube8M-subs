00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
obvious reasons you can't hide from it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
obvious reasons you can't hide from it
and<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> where<00:01:56.219> Ghost<00:01:56.460> users<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.939> really

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and this is where Ghost users are really

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
and this is where Ghost users are really
at<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> disadvantage<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.649> don't

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
at a disadvantage because now they don't

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590 
at a disadvantage because now they don't
even<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> perk<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.729> everyone<00:02:00.390> else<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
even have a perk one everyone else is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969 
even have a perk one everyone else is
gonna<00:02:00.719> print<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.140> except<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.829> they

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
gonna print one except them because they

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
gonna print one except them because they
can't<00:02:02.189> hide<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.119> that's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can't hide from this thing and that's

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
can't hide from this thing and that's
what<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> most<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.430> just

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
what I like about it the most it just

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.980 
what I like about it the most it just
takes<00:02:05.850> away<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.180> ability<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.840> guys

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
takes away that ability for these guys

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.199 
takes away that ability for these guys
to<00:02:07.200> hide<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> love<00:02:07.950> that
