00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.540
There are no wasted efforts in nature. The
fragrance of a flower, the smell of an orange,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.570
or the scent of a pine tree, all serve specific
purposes vital to the plants survival.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.289
What our senses perceive as fragrances or
scents are actually volatile aromatic compounds,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.710
tiny organic molecules that serve a variety
of protective, reproductive, and regenerative

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.869
purposes. These compounds help ward off unfriendly
pests, attract friendly herbivores and insects,

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.480
and even help the plant heal from physical
infection and injury.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.490
There are over 3000 identified varieties of
aromatic compounds, each with its own unique

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.760
and functional chemical constituents that
provide different aromas and benefits to the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.760
plants. From the petals of a flower, to the
leaves of a plant, the rind of a fruit, or

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.630
the resin of a tree, these volatile aromatic
compounds are all around us.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.700
Distilled directly from their plant sources,
essential oils are multifaceted agents that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.460
have seemingly endless applications to our
health and can be used aromatically, topically,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.030
or internally.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.399
Ensuring the maximum potency and beneficial
properties of an essential oil are the result

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.009
of maintaining the delicate ratio of aromatic
constituents found in that essential oil.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.530
All of which can vary depending on the time
of day or part of the plant which is harvested,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.630
the time of year or lifecycle when harvested,
the geographic location and weather where

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.520
the plant was grown, or the method and even
the duration of distillation.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.710
For that reason, it is vital that essential
oils come from a trusted source committed

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.060
to not only producing unadulterated essential
oils but to adhering to the strictest production

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.459
protocols.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.049
There are no wasted efforts in nature. Neither
should there be in the healthcare that you

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.429
provide for yourself and those you love.
