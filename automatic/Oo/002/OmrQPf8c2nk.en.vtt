changing<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.840> we<00:04:13.960> see<00:04:14.110> mrs.<00:04:14.410> it's<00:04:15.340> multiplex

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
changing so we see mrs. it's multiplex

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.940 
changing so we see mrs. it's multiplex
mrs.<00:04:16.150> bless<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.190> see<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:23.650> can<00:04:23.800> see

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
mrs. bless you can see here we can see

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.280 
mrs. bless you can see here we can see
it's<00:04:24.070> starting<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.520> shift<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.960> move

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
it's starting to shift I go to move

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.590 
it's starting to shift I go to move
forward<00:04:26.590> forward<00:04:26.980> forward<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.240> can<00:04:28.390> see

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
forward forward forward and we can see

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.250 
forward forward forward and we can see
this<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:29.020> being<00:04:29.580> indicative<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:31.060> change<00:04:32.020> in

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
this as being indicative a change in

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.470 
this as being indicative a change in
locomotion<00:04:32.760> when<00:04:33.760> we<00:04:33.880> spoke<00:04:34.000> about<00:04:34.330> earlier

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
locomotion when we spoke about earlier

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.910 
locomotion when we spoke about earlier
we<00:04:34.780> said<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.140> actually<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
we said that actually that the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.760 
we said that actually that the
diagnostic<00:04:36.730> future<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.210> hominids<00:04:37.930> was<00:04:38.620> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
diagnostic future of hominids was the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.160 
diagnostic future of hominids was the
bipedal<00:04:38.980> locomotion<00:04:39.540> now<00:04:40.540> this<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.780> what<00:04:41.050> we

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
bipedal locomotion now this is what we

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.979 
bipedal locomotion now this is what we
see<00:04:41.350> in<00:04:41.470> mrs.<00:04:41.770> plez<00:04:42.010> and

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:43.989 
see in mrs. plez and

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:47.319 
see in mrs. plez and
gasp<00:04:44.989> and<00:04:45.889> Homo<00:04:46.279> habilis<00:04:46.399> we<00:04:46.789> see<00:04:46.969> this<00:04:47.119> this

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:47.329 
gasp and Homo habilis we see this this

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.379 
gasp and Homo habilis we see this this
foramen<00:04:47.719> magnum<00:04:47.749> positioned<00:04:49.059> so<00:04:50.059> thin<00:04:50.299> it

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
foramen magnum positioned so thin it

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.329 
foramen magnum positioned so thin it
would<00:04:50.509> enable<00:04:50.749> much<00:04:51.559> more<00:04:51.799> predominant

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:52.339 
would enable much more predominant

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:55.269 
would enable much more predominant
bipedal<00:04:52.789> locomotion<00:04:52.969> which<00:04:53.869> is<00:04:54.279> basically

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:55.279 
bipedal locomotion which is basically

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.519 
bipedal locomotion which is basically
what<00:04:55.369> we're<00:04:55.639> looking<00:04:55.909> for<00:04:55.939> now<00:04:56.929> Raymond<00:04:57.349> dart

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
what we're looking for now Raymond dart

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.189 
what we're looking for now Raymond dart
found<00:04:58.489> this<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.999> found<00:04:59.419> this<00:04:59.599> skull<00:04:59.959> and

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
found this and found this skull and

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.319 
found this and found this skull and
found<00:05:00.769> that<00:05:00.829> it<00:05:00.949> would<00:05:01.129> be<00:05:01.339> orientated<00:05:01.879> when

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:02.329 
found that it would be orientated when

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:07.449 
found that it would be orientated when
it<00:05:02.449> was<00:05:02.539> put<00:05:03.169> on<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:03.439> other<00:05:03.529> part<00:05:06.309> in<00:05:07.309> a

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:07.459 
it was put on the other part in a

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.429 
it was put on the other part in a
position<00:05:07.759> that<00:05:08.149> was<00:05:08.569> directly<00:05:09.049> underneath

position that was directly underneath
the<00:05:09.739> skull<00:05:10.009> so<00:05:10.279> that<00:05:10.999> told<00:05:11.299> him<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.629> this<00:05:11.719> was

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:11.929 
the skull so that told him that this was

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:15.039 
the skull so that told him that this was
a<00:05:11.959> bipedal<00:05:12.229> hominid<00:05:13.239> and<00:05:14.239> that<00:05:14.449> really<00:05:14.719> was

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:15.049 
a bipedal hominid and that really was

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:17.049 
a bipedal hominid and that really was
what<00:05:15.319> everyone<00:05:15.589> was<00:05:15.709> looking<00:05:15.889> for<00:05:16.309> two<00:05:16.849> other

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:17.059 
what everyone was looking for two other

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.839 
what everyone was looking for two other
contenders<00:05:17.719> to<00:05:17.899> this<00:05:18.079> of<00:05:18.319> course<00:05:18.819> with<00:05:19.819> a

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.919 
campus now both of those investments
build<00:05:24.829> a<00:05:24.949> man<00:05:25.129> was<00:05:25.309> an<00:05:25.579> elaborate<00:05:26.089> hoax<00:05:26.329> and

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:26.929 
build a man was an elaborate hoax and

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:28.959 
build a man was an elaborate hoax and
the<00:05:27.679> Pithecanthropus<00:05:28.399> was<00:05:28.549> proved<00:05:28.759> to<00:05:28.849> be

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
the Pithecanthropus was proved to be

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.289 
the Pithecanthropus was proved to be
much<00:05:29.119> much<00:05:29.389> younger<00:05:29.619> so<00:05:30.729> basically<00:05:31.729> came<00:05:32.029> down

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:32.299 
much much younger so basically came down

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:35.139 
much much younger so basically came down
to<00:05:32.959> Raymond<00:05:33.349> dart<00:05:33.529> and<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.129> tongue<00:05:34.369> child<00:05:34.669> now

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:35.149 
to Raymond dart and the tongue child now

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.609 
to Raymond dart and the tongue child now
not<00:05:35.360> everyone<00:05:35.569> believed<00:05:35.899> this<00:05:36.049> unfortunately

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:36.619 
not everyone believed this unfortunately

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:41.079 
not everyone believed this unfortunately
and<00:05:37.129> it<00:05:37.279> would<00:05:37.399> take<00:05:37.610> 25<00:05:38.569> years<00:05:39.429> before<00:05:40.429> mrs.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
people start to believe and look to

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.489 
people start to believe and look to

evolution now mrs. plez is exactly the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.119 
evolution now mrs. plez is exactly the

africanus as the tongue child as we go
on<00:06:04.899> from<00:06:05.899> history<00:06:06.469> but<00:06:07.009> things<00:06:07.249> change<00:06:07.729> a

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
on from history but things change a

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.049 
on from history but things change a
little<00:06:08.059> bit<00:06:08.209> and<00:06:09.309> basically<00:06:10.309> what<00:06:10.550> happens<00:06:10.939> is

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:11.059 
little bit and basically what happens is

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.899 
little bit and basically what happens is
everything<00:06:11.949> what<00:06:12.949> was<00:06:13.099> previously<00:06:13.369> thought

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
everything what was previously thought

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.539 
everything what was previously thought
is<00:06:14.539> that<00:06:14.899> the<00:06:15.589> first<00:06:15.829> thing<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.129> change<00:06:16.369> was

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:16.549 
is that the first thing to change was

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:18.699 
is that the first thing to change was
decides<00:06:16.879> the<00:06:17.059> brain<00:06:17.299> that's<00:06:18.139> what<00:06:18.379> everyone

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:18.709 
decides the brain that's what everyone

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:19.989 
decides the brain that's what everyone
thought<00:06:18.889> was<00:06:19.069> happening<00:06:19.189> and<00:06:19.639> so<00:06:19.789> what

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:19.999 
thought was happening and so what

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.999 
thought was happening and so what
happened<00:06:20.419> at<00:06:20.839> the<00:06:20.989> hill<00:06:21.169> down<00:06:21.349> man<00:06:21.589> why<00:06:21.799> it<00:06:21.860> was

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
happened at the hill down man why it was

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.489 
happened at the hill down man why it was
so<00:06:22.159> convincing<00:06:22.729> is<00:06:23.209> he<00:06:23.360> took<00:06:23.539> a<00:06:23.779> gorilla<00:06:24.199> it's

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:24.499 
so convincing is he took a gorilla it's

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.919 
so convincing is he took a gorilla it's
the<00:06:24.619> chimpanzee<00:06:25.129> and<00:06:25.339> the<00:06:26.239> hoax<00:06:26.479> was<00:06:26.629> that

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:26.929 
the chimpanzee and the hoax was that

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:30.129 
the chimpanzee and the hoax was that
they<00:06:27.019> glued<00:06:27.879> the<00:06:28.879> gorilla<00:06:29.209> they<00:06:29.659> file<00:06:29.899> down

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
they glued the gorilla they file down

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.399 
they glued the gorilla they file down
the<00:06:31.029> canines<00:06:32.029> and<00:06:32.209> include<00:06:32.629> it<00:06:32.779> straight<00:06:33.289> on

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409

the canines and include it straight on
like<00:06:33.439> that<00:06:33.769> and<00:06:34.239> one<00:06:35.239> of<00:06:35.269> the<00:06:35.419> guys<00:06:35.569> that

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
like that and one of the guys that

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.539 
like that and one of the guys that
listen<00:06:36.110> going<00:06:36.439> digging<00:06:36.799> that<00:06:36.889> pit<00:06:37.129> and<00:06:37.399> there

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:37.549 
listen going digging that pit and there

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:39.519 
listen going digging that pit and there
might<00:06:37.699> be<00:06:37.729> a<00:06:37.879> fossil<00:06:38.049> everyone<00:06:39.049> believed<00:06:39.349> this

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
might be a fossil everyone believed this

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.129 
might be a fossil everyone believed this
is<00:06:39.589> exactly<00:06:40.009> what<00:06:40.369> evolution<00:06:41.059> had<00:06:41.239> the

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
is exactly what evolution had the

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.529 
is exactly what evolution had the
process<00:06:42.499> of<00:06:42.619> any<00:06:42.829> evolution<00:06:43.429> happened<00:06:43.879> in

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
process of any evolution happened in

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.409 
process of any evolution happened in
terms<00:06:44.779> of<00:06:44.929> hominids<00:06:45.579> brain<00:06:46.579> was<00:06:46.819> to<00:06:46.939> go<00:06:47.089> first

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
terms of hominids brain was to go first

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.289 
terms of hominids brain was to go first
then<00:06:48.199> the<00:06:48.379> dentition<00:06:48.709> was<00:06:49.009> to<00:06:49.189> change<00:06:49.459> now<00:06:50.239> we

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:50.299 
then the dentition was to change now we

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:51.690 
then the dentition was to change now we
know<00:06:50.569> that<00:06:50.599> to<00:06:50.839> be<00:06:50.929> very<00:06:50.959> different

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
know that to be very different

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.480 
know that to be very different
we<00:06:52.150> know<00:06:52.360> that<00:06:52.840> from<00:06:53.230> the<00:06:53.530> town<00:06:53.770> child<00:06:54.100> and<00:06:54.370> for

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
we know that from the town child and for

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.540 
we know that from the town child and for
mrs.<00:06:54.850> plez<00:06:55.090> that<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.470> dentition<00:06:56.890> is<00:06:57.280> the

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
mrs. plez that the the dentition is the

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.880 
mrs. plez that the the dentition is the
first<00:06:57.790> thing<00:06:58.030> to<00:06:58.150> change<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.600> diet<00:06:58.840> the<00:06:59.620> first

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
first thing to change the diet the first

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.920 
first thing to change the diet the first
thing<00:07:00.040> to<00:07:00.160> change<00:07:00.400> which<00:07:00.790> then<00:07:01.030> allows<00:07:01.390> the

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
thing to change which then allows the

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.040 
thing to change which then allows the
brain<00:07:02.140> to<00:07:02.200> start<00:07:02.560> changing
