fun<00:00:19.359> this<00:00:20.200> week<00:00:20.530> on<00:00:20.710> let's<00:00:20.920> learn<00:00:21.070> Giant<00:00:21.490> Steps

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
fun this week on let's learn Giant Steps

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.550 
fun this week on let's learn Giant Steps
I'm<00:00:21.910> going<00:00:22.180> to<00:00:22.300> show<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:22.570> yet<00:00:22.990> another<00:00:23.020> way<00:00:23.530> to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
I'm going to show you yet another way to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.279 
I'm going to show you yet another way to
play<00:00:23.860> through<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.250> changes<00:00:25.020> utilizing<00:00:26.020> a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
play through the changes utilizing a

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.230 
play through the changes utilizing a
technique<00:00:26.920> that<00:00:26.950> I'd<00:00:27.280> featured<00:00:27.760> in<00:00:28.180> a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
technique that I'd featured in a

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.410 
technique that I'd featured in a
previous<00:00:29.080> dr.<00:00:29.680> Lebon<00:00:29.830> episode<00:00:30.430> I<00:00:30.730> think<00:00:31.330> it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
previous dr. Lebon episode I think it

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.380 
previous dr. Lebon episode I think it
was<00:00:31.539> called<00:00:31.840> how<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.559> play<00:00:33.039> arpeggios<00:00:33.670> fast

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
was called how to play arpeggios fast

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.810 
was called how to play arpeggios fast
without<00:00:34.660> sweeping<00:00:35.379> something<00:00:36.190> like<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.579> but

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
without sweeping something like that but

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.190 
without sweeping something like that but
I've<00:00:36.910> got<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.090> link<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.510> video<00:00:37.750> below<00:00:38.050> and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
I've got a link to that video below and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.990 
I've got a link to that video below and
I'm<00:00:38.440> gonna<00:00:38.620> use<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.130> technique<00:00:39.579> from<00:00:39.850> that

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
I'm gonna use the technique from that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.660 
I'm gonna use the technique from that
video<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:41.260> play<00:00:41.649> through<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> changes<00:00:42.640> of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
video to play through the changes of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.569 
video to play through the changes of
giant<00:00:43.120> steps<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:44.500> technique<00:00:44.950> involves

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
giant steps so this technique involves

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.030 
giant steps so this technique involves
playing<00:00:46.030> arpeggios<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.780> sound<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.829> look

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
playing arpeggios that sound and look

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:58.860 
playing arpeggios that sound and look
like<00:00:48.100> this<00:00:56.370> basically<00:00:57.370> there's<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:58.030> symmetry

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
like this basically there's a symmetry

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.709 
like this basically there's a symmetry
of<00:00:59.079> playing<00:00:59.410> two<00:00:59.739> notes<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.460> one<00:01:03.479> on<00:01:04.479> each

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.719 
of playing two notes and one on each

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:06.840 
of playing two notes and one on each
string<00:01:05.079> so<00:01:05.350> two<00:01:05.590> on<00:01:05.890> one<00:01:06.100> string<00:01:06.340> more<00:01:06.670> on<00:01:06.759> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
string so two on one string more on the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.050 
string so two on one string more on the
next<00:01:07.149> two<00:01:07.479> one<00:01:07.959> two<00:01:08.259> one<00:01:08.289> and<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.939> a

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
next two one two one and it's a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.609 
next two one two one and it's a
technique<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.630> explained<00:01:11.079> in<00:01:11.200> detail<00:01:11.590> in

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
technique that I explained in detail in

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.949 
technique that I explained in detail in
the<00:01:12.009> video<00:01:12.520> linked<00:01:12.939> below<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.539> when<00:01:13.869> we're

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:13.959 
the video linked below and when we're

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.539 
the video linked below and when we're
going<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.170> just<00:01:14.319> go<00:01:14.499> through<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.039> changes<00:01:15.429> of

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
going to just go through the changes of

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.149 
going to just go through the changes of
giant<00:01:15.909> steps<00:01:16.149> using<00:01:16.719> these<00:01:17.229> arpeggios<00:01:17.530> and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
giant steps using these arpeggios and

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.739 
giant steps using these arpeggios and
now<00:01:18.249> the<00:01:18.310> challenge<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.149> since<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:19.749 
now the challenge is that since the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.389 
now the challenge is that since the
giant<00:01:20.109> steps<00:01:20.350> changes<00:01:20.770> move<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.159> quickly

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
giant steps changes move so quickly

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.429 
giant steps changes move so quickly
sometimes<00:01:22.270> we're<00:01:22.450> going<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.779> have<00:01:22.929> to<00:01:23.139> stick

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
sometimes we're going to have to stick

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.429 
sometimes we're going to have to stick
to<00:01:23.740> our<00:01:23.770> pezzi<00:01:24.189> O's<00:01:24.429> into<00:01:24.939> one<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:25.959> in<00:01:26.289> other

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
to our pezzi O's into one so in other

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.580 
to our pezzi O's into one so in other
words<00:01:26.709> B<00:01:27.340> major<00:01:27.549> seven<00:01:28.090> going<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.569> d7<00:01:29.020> happens

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
words B major seven going to d7 happens

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.129 
words B major seven going to d7 happens
so<00:01:29.859> quickly<00:01:30.159> that<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.999> turn<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.630> B<00:01:31.899> major

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
so quickly that I turn this B major

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.109 
so quickly that I turn this B major
seven<00:01:32.560> arpeggio<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.799> D<00:01:36.099> seven<00:01:36.579> halfway

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
seven arpeggio into D seven halfway

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.930 
seven arpeggio into D seven halfway
through

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.400 

actually<00:01:41.940> it's<00:01:42.950> d13<00:01:43.950> lit<00:01:44.730> to<00:01:44.910> be<00:01:45.090> exact<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
actually it's d13 lit to be exact but it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:56.510 
actually it's d13 lit to be exact but it
works<00:01:46.920> over<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.640> d7<00:01:48.420> chord<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.050> go<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:55.520> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
works over a d7 chord so I go be so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.109 
works over a d7 chord so I go be so
throughout<00:01:57.510> this<00:01:57.720> etude<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:59.119> arpeggios

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
throughout this etude of arpeggios

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
throughout this etude of arpeggios
you'll<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.050> instances<00:02:01.920> where<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you'll have instances where the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.510 
you'll have instances where the
arpeggios<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.440> stuck<00:02:04.830> together<00:02:05.070> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
arpeggios are kind of stuck together so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
arpeggios are kind of stuck together so
it's<00:02:05.670> 2<00:02:05.940> &amp;<00:02:06.270> 1<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> great<00:02:10.110> way

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's 2 &amp; 1 and it's a just a great way

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's 2 &amp; 1 and it's a just a great way
to<00:02:10.310> further<00:02:11.310> learn<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> changes<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to further learn the changes and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.270 
to further learn the changes and
everything<00:02:13.260> I've<00:02:13.410> shown<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.920> series

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
everything I've shown you in this series

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.020 
everything I've shown you in this series
so<00:02:14.459> far<00:02:14.700> has<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.239> been<00:02:15.480> stuff<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.260> help<00:02:17.030> not

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so far has just been stuff to help not

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
so far has just been stuff to help not
just<00:02:18.330> learn<00:02:18.600> giant<00:02:18.989> steps<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.410> way<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:19.860> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
just learn giant steps one way but to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
just learn giant steps one way but to
learn<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.430> many<00:02:20.700> different<00:02:20.940> ways<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
learn it in many different ways and
