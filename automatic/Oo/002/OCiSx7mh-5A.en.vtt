that<00:00:41.200> those<00:00:41.440> liquids<00:00:41.920> could<00:00:42.130> end<00:00:42.280> up<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.579> their

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
that those liquids could end up in their

that those liquids could end up in their
lungs<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.809> thickened<00:00:44.230> liquids<00:00:44.680> help<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.670> make

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
lungs the thickened liquids help to make

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.389 
lungs the thickened liquids help to make
the<00:00:46.329> fluid<00:00:46.660> flow<00:00:46.930> more<00:00:47.140> slowly<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.890> allow<00:00:48.340> the

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
the fluid flow more slowly and allow the

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.400 
the fluid flow more slowly and allow the
patient<00:00:48.940> more<00:00:49.090> control<00:00:49.539> over<00:00:49.570> those<00:00:49.929> liquids

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
patient more control over those liquids

patient more control over those liquids
so<00:00:50.590> it's<00:00:50.710> really<00:00:50.890> important<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.760> the

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
so it's really important that the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.430 
so it's really important that the

consistency in Australia we have three

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.130 
consistency in Australia we have three

different levels of fluid thickness we

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.549 
different levels of fluid thickness we

thick these different thicknesses are

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.899 
thick these different thicknesses are
quite<00:01:08.470> important<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.310> they're<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> little<00:01:09.760> bit

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
quite important and they're a little bit

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.090 
quite important and they're a little bit
like<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.600> medication<00:01:11.350> where<00:01:11.680> you've<00:01:11.770> got<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.010> be

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
like a medication where you've got to be

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.430 
like a medication where you've got to be
sure<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.550> you've<00:01:12.670> got<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.000> right<00:01:13.180> dose<00:01:13.540> the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
sure that you've got the right dose the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.890 
sure that you've got the right dose the
patients<00:01:15.010> with<00:01:15.430> difficulty<00:01:15.970> swallowing<00:01:16.150> the

patients with difficulty swallowing the
correct<00:01:17.260> thickness<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:18.340> not<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:18.940> much<00:01:19.150> a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
correct thickness is not so much a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.440 
correct thickness is not so much a
matter<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.380> choice<00:01:20.710> as<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.130> necessity<00:01:21.790> it's

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
matter of choice as a necessity it's

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.970 
matter of choice as a necessity it's
important<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.020> they<00:01:23.230> have<00:01:23.260> this<00:01:23.620> for<00:01:23.860> their

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
speaking quite rapidly now over time and
there<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.620> doesn't<00:02:21.890> change<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> taste<00:02:22.490> or<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
there it doesn't change the taste or the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.390 
there it doesn't change the taste or the
odor<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> product<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> same

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
odor of the product and it's the same

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.250 
odor of the product and it's the same
amount<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:26.300> powder

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
amount of powder

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.380 
amount of powder
whether<00:02:27.950> you're<00:02:28.130> thickening<00:02:28.430> water<00:02:28.730> juice

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
whether you're thickening water juice

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.590 
whether you're thickening water juice
fizzy<00:02:29.990> drinks<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.090> forth

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
fizzy drinks and so forth

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.760 
fizzy drinks and so forth
it<00:02:33.560> doesn't<00:02:33.920> lump<00:02:34.100> either<00:02:34.310> as<00:02:34.550> you'll<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:34.880> now

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
it doesn't lump either as you'll see now

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.160 
it doesn't lump either as you'll see now
and<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.890> does<00:02:37.070> become<00:02:37.220> transparent<00:02:40.959> okay<00:02:41.959> so

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and it does become transparent okay so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.510 
and it does become transparent okay so
you<00:02:42.260> can<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:42.650> already<00:02:42.920> working<00:02:43.130> now

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
you can see that's already working now

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.370 
you can see that's already working now
and<00:02:43.970> getting<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.420> its<00:02:44.570> right<00:02:44.780> consistency<00:02:45.590> I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
and getting to its right consistency I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.840 
and getting to its right consistency I
do<00:02:48.380> use<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.709> foot<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.070> can<00:02:49.250> use<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> fork<00:02:49.670> or<00:02:49.820> a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
do use a foot you can use a fork or a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.520 
do use a foot you can use a fork or a
spoon<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.330> prefer<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.630> use<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.840> fork<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.320> find

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
spoon but I prefer to use a fork I find

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.050 
spoon but I prefer to use a fork I find
it<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.650> gives<00:02:51.950> better<00:02:52.130> results<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.970> it's

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it just gives better results but it's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:19.190 
it just gives better results but it's
entirely<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.600> you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.339 

so<00:03:19.770> now<00:03:19.890> I'll<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.130> demonstrating<00:03:20.840> using<00:03:21.840> apple

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
so now I'll be demonstrating using apple

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.170 
so now I'll be demonstrating using apple
juice<00:03:22.560> making<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.459> moderately<00:03:24.030> thick

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
juice making up a moderately thick

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.860 
juice making up a moderately thick
consistency<00:03:25.080> or<00:03:25.200> honey<00:03:25.410> consistency<00:03:26.870> so

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
consistency or honey consistency so

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.839 
consistency or honey consistency so
again<00:03:28.440> grab<00:03:28.800> your<00:03:28.950> scooper<00:03:29.340> make<00:03:29.489> sure<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
again grab your scooper make sure you

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.270 
again grab your scooper make sure you
place<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.900> powder<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.770> shaker

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
place that the powder in the shaker

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.300 
place that the powder in the shaker
first<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.840> moderately<00:03:34.500> thick<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.950> for

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
first and for moderately thick it's for

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.440 
first and for moderately thick it's for
small<00:03:35.910> scoops<00:03:37.730> again<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.970> make<00:03:39.090> sure<00:03:39.120> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
small scoops again just make sure you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.320 
small scoops again just make sure you
level<00:03:39.630> them<00:03:39.840> off<00:03:39.989> as<00:03:40.170> well<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.300> a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
level them off as well you just get a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.660 
level them off as well you just get a
better<00:03:42.510> outcome<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:46.140> there's<00:03:46.319> four<00:03:49.489> well<00:03:50.489> at

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
better outcome so there's four well at

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:01.580 
better outcome so there's four well at
the<00:03:50.849> apple<00:03:51.390> juice<00:03:51.950> 200<00:03:52.950> mils<00:03:53.130> again

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.570 

give<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> good<00:04:02.830> shake

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.600 

okay<00:04:11.560> pour<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.680> into<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.980> glass<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.430> you'll

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
okay pour that into the glass and you'll

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.900 
okay pour that into the glass and you'll
see<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.850> there<00:04:14.030> are<00:04:14.060> no<00:04:14.210> lumps<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:16.670> does

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
see that there are no lumps it does

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.250 
see that there are no lumps it does
actually<00:04:17.090> take<00:04:17.270> a<00:04:17.480> couple<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.900> minutes<00:04:18.140> to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
actually take a couple of minutes to

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.440 
actually take a couple of minutes to
come<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.620> its<00:04:18.770> right<00:04:18.980> consistency<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:26.330> I've

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
come to its right consistency so I've

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.230 
come to its right consistency so I've
looked<00:04:26.600> at<00:04:26.780> mixing<00:04:27.110> up<00:04:27.260> 200<00:04:27.770> mil<00:04:28.090> amounts<00:04:29.090> of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
looked at mixing up 200 mil amounts of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.730 
looked at mixing up 200 mil amounts of
volumes<00:04:29.630> now<00:04:30.080> we're<00:04:30.230> going<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.440> look<00:04:30.620> at<00:04:30.710> a

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
volumes now we're going to look at a

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.100 
volumes now we're going to look at a
larger<00:04:31.070> quantity<00:04:31.220> one<00:04:31.940> later<00:04:32.180> we're<00:04:32.840> going<00:04:32.990> to

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
larger quantity one later we're going to

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.840 
larger quantity one later we're going to
use<00:04:33.200> apple<00:04:33.560> juice<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.100> I'm<00:04:34.220> going<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.490> mix<00:04:34.730> it

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
use apple juice and I'm going to mix it

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.880 
use apple juice and I'm going to mix it
up<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.210> mob<00:04:35.480> with<00:04:35.690> bit<00:04:35.900> consistency<00:04:36.680> or

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
up to a mob with bit consistency or

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.450 
up to a mob with bit consistency or
nectar<00:04:37.220> consistency<00:04:38.350> for<00:04:39.350> mildly<00:04:39.950> thick<00:04:40.280> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
nectar consistency for mildly thick and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.330 
nectar consistency for mildly thick and
one<00:04:40.580> later<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:41.030> use<00:04:41.210> too<00:04:41.660> sorry<00:04:42.230> 10<00:04:42.590> scoops

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
one later you use too sorry 10 scoops

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.340 
one later you use too sorry 10 scoops
but<00:04:44.210> I've<00:04:44.330> pre<00:04:44.540> measured<00:04:44.720> them<00:04:44.990> already<00:04:45.200> for

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
but I've pre measured them already for

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.900 
but I've pre measured them already for
you

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
you

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.250 
you
same<00:04:46.910> principle<00:04:47.300> applies<00:04:47.570> have<00:04:47.840> placed<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.170> in

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
same principle applies have placed it in

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.970 
same principle applies have placed it in
the<00:04:48.350> jug<00:04:48.560> first<00:04:48.920> before<00:04:49.370> adding<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.820> fluid<00:04:50.980> so

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
the jug first before adding the fluid so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.230 
the jug first before adding the fluid so
we'll<00:04:52.250> grab<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.550> particular<00:04:52.910> end<00:04:53.030> at<00:04:53.150> this

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
we'll grab the particular end at this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:07.840 
we'll grab the particular end at this
time<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:54.280> I'll<00:04:55.280> start<00:04:55.580> pouring<00:04:56.000> in<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.270> fluid

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.360 

so<00:05:08.420> give<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.750> good<00:05:08.900> mix<00:05:09.650> with<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.130> stick

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
so give it a good mix with the stick

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:18.010 
so give it a good mix with the stick
blender

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.860 

now<00:05:19.699> juicers<00:05:20.699> will<00:05:20.879> actually<00:05:21.210> take<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.449> little

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
now juicers will actually take a little

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.480 
now juicers will actually take a little
bit<00:05:21.990> longer<00:05:22.259> to<00:05:22.979> get<00:05:23.099> to<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.280> right

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
bit longer to get to the right

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.839 
bit longer to get to the right
consistency<00:05:23.879> in<00:05:24.360> chicken<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.250> don't<00:05:26.430> panic<00:05:26.639> if

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
consistency in chicken so don't panic if

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.450 
consistency in chicken so don't panic if
it<00:05:27.000> doesn't<00:05:27.270> look<00:05:27.360> right<00:05:27.419> to<00:05:27.960> start<00:05:28.259> with<00:05:28.470> just

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
it doesn't look right to start with just

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.980 
it doesn't look right to start with just
make<00:05:29.669> sure<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.300> is<00:05:30.389> actually<00:05:30.780> thoroughly

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
make sure that it is actually thoroughly

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:41.350 
make sure that it is actually thoroughly
mix<00:05:31.379> through<00:05:35.599> that<00:05:36.599> should<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:36.930> right<00:05:37.139> now

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.080 

take<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.539> out

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.260 

according<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:47.080> glass

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:59.409 

and<00:05:50.509> you'll<00:05:50.990> see<00:05:51.169> there<00:05:51.349> are<00:05:51.380> no<00:05:51.560> lumps<00:05:58.419> thanks

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
and you'll see there are no lumps thanks

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.029 
and you'll see there are no lumps thanks
Lisa<00:05:59.720> for<00:05:59.900> showing<00:06:00.169> us<00:06:00.259> how<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.470> thicken<00:06:00.860> up

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
Lisa for showing us how to thicken up

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.040 
Lisa for showing us how to thicken up
the<00:06:01.280> different<00:06:01.849> consistencies<00:06:02.599> so<00:06:02.840> now<00:06:02.990> we

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
the different consistencies so now we

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.350 
the different consistencies so now we
have<00:06:03.319> a<00:06:03.349> mildly<00:06:03.800> thick<00:06:04.099> a<00:06:04.370> moderately<00:06:05.210> thick

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
have a mildly thick a moderately thick

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.559 
have a mildly thick a moderately thick
and<00:06:05.840> an<00:06:06.349> extremely<00:06:06.830> thick<00:06:07.280> I'm<00:06:08.060> going<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.419> use

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
and an extremely thick I'm going to use

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.390 
and an extremely thick I'm going to use
the<00:06:08.780> fork<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.289> show<00:06:09.470> you<00:06:09.530> what<00:06:10.250> those

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
the fork to show you what those

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.420 
the fork to show you what those
consistencies<00:06:11.270> look<00:06:11.509> like<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:13.039> mildly

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
consistencies look like so the mildly

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.700 
consistencies look like so the mildly
thick<00:06:13.789> flows<00:06:14.419> very<00:06:14.690> quickly<00:06:15.050> through<00:06:15.530> the

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
thick flows very quickly through the

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.800 
thick flows very quickly through the
fork<00:06:17.139> and<00:06:18.139> if<00:06:18.259> I<00:06:18.380> tip<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.880> can<00:06:20.060> see<00:06:20.360> that<00:06:20.690> it

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
fork and if I tip it you can see that it

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.249 
fork and if I tip it you can see that it
flows<00:06:21.169> slower<00:06:22.039> than<00:06:22.280> water<00:06:22.720> but<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:23.840> still<00:06:24.110> has

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
flows slower than water but it still has

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.899 
flows slower than water but it still has
quite<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.590> good<00:06:24.800> flow<00:06:25.069> on<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.340> it<00:06:25.460> would<00:06:25.610> be<00:06:25.729> easy

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
quite a good flow on it it would be easy

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.909 
quite a good flow on it it would be easy
to<00:06:26.060> drink<00:06:26.449> this<00:06:26.599> from<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.020> cup<00:06:29.919> the

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
to drink this from the cup the

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.790 
to drink this from the cup the
moderately<00:06:31.310> thick<00:06:32.199> falls<00:06:33.199> in<00:06:33.409> dollops

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
moderately thick falls in dollops

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.149 
moderately thick falls in dollops
through<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.699> fork<00:06:38.139> the<00:06:39.139> flow<00:06:39.409> on<00:06:39.590> this<00:06:39.770> one<00:06:39.979> is

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
through the fork the flow on this one is

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.059 
through the fork the flow on this one is
slower<00:06:40.550> than<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.539> mildly<00:06:41.870> thick<00:06:42.259> and<00:06:42.830> yet<00:06:42.979> it

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
slower than the mildly thick and yet it

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.649 
slower than the mildly thick and yet it
would<00:06:43.159> still<00:06:43.460> be<00:06:43.580> possible<00:06:43.759> to<00:06:44.180> drink<00:06:44.389> this

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
would still be possible to drink this

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:49.550 
would still be possible to drink this
from<00:06:44.900> a<00:06:44.930> cup

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.920 

the<00:06:50.560> extremely<00:06:51.070> thick<00:06:51.520> holds<00:06:52.150> on<00:06:52.330> the<00:06:52.450> fork

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.700 

this<00:06:56.930> flows<00:06:57.260> very<00:06:57.890> slowly<00:06:58.870> and<00:06:59.870> using<00:07:00.260> a<00:07:00.350> spoon

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
this flows very slowly and using a spoon

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.560 
this flows very slowly and using a spoon
would<00:07:01.190> be<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.520> easiest<00:07:01.850> way<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.150> drink<00:07:02.630> this

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.630 

so<00:07:08.080> one<00:07:08.230> of<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.440> nice<00:07:08.590> things<00:07:08.950> about<00:07:09.070> being<00:07:09.220> up

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
so one of the nice things about being up

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.250 
so one of the nice things about being up
clear<00:07:09.910> is<00:07:10.210> that<00:07:10.390> you<00:07:10.510> can<00:07:10.660> thicken<00:07:10.870> up<00:07:11.110> your

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
clear is that you can thicken up your

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.690 
clear is that you can thicken up your
favorite<00:07:11.470> drink<00:07:11.920> if<00:07:12.130> you<00:07:12.220> happen<00:07:12.490> to<00:07:12.520> be<00:07:12.610> out

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
favorite drink if you happen to be out

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.430 
favorite drink if you happen to be out
at<00:07:12.880> a<00:07:12.940> cafe<00:07:13.330> having<00:07:13.660> a<00:07:13.720> cup<00:07:13.930> of<00:07:14.080> tea<00:07:14.260> or<00:07:14.290> coffee

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
at a cafe having a cup of tea or coffee

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:39.080 
at a cafe having a cup of tea or coffee
you<00:07:14.980> can<00:07:15.520> mix<00:07:15.730> it<00:07:15.880> up<00:07:16.000> at<00:07:16.570> the<00:07:16.810> table

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.150
