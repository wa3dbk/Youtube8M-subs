base<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.419> got<00:03:13.599> 45<00:03:14.079> shots<00:03:14.379> in<00:03:14.620> there<00:03:14.829> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
base it's got 45 shots in there and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.920 
base it's got 45 shots in there and
that's<00:03:15.430> what<00:03:15.579> separates<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.419> on<00:03:16.569> top<00:03:16.780> of

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that's what separates it that on top of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.899 
that's what separates it that on top of
the<00:03:17.019> fact<00:03:17.199> that<00:03:17.319> it's<00:03:17.530> pretty<00:03:17.909> reliable

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
the fact that it's pretty reliable

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.430 
the fact that it's pretty reliable
medium<00:03:19.299> range<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:19.659> more<00:03:19.810> reliable<00:03:20.079> than<00:03:20.319> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
medium range it's more reliable than the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.559 
medium range it's more reliable than the
MX<00:03:20.799> in<00:03:20.949> my<00:03:21.069> opinion<00:03:21.310> at<00:03:21.519> medium<00:03:22.150> range<00:03:22.180> which

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
MX in my opinion at medium range which

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.059 
MX in my opinion at medium range which
is<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.780> one<00:03:22.959> thing<00:03:23.139> that<00:03:23.169> sets<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.829> gun

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
is the one thing that sets this gun

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.979 
is the one thing that sets this gun
apart<00:03:24.400> also<00:03:25.060> am<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.329> only<00:03:25.449> one<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.810> thinks

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
apart also am I the only one that thinks

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.569 
apart also am I the only one that thinks
there<00:03:26.199> needs<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.530> elevator<00:03:27.040> music<00:03:27.430> for

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
there needs to be elevator music for

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:36.950 
there needs to be elevator music for
this<00:03:27.639> come<00:03:27.909> on<00:03:28.030> now

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960 

okay<00:03:37.860> come<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.160> admit<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.640> would<00:03:38.730> be<00:03:38.790> pretty

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
okay come on admit that would be pretty

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
okay come on admit that would be pretty
cool<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.300> there<00:03:39.570> was<00:03:39.690> actually<00:03:40.110> some<00:03:40.320> sort<00:03:40.560> of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
cool if there was actually some sort of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.810 
cool if there was actually some sort of
music<00:03:41.010> you're<00:03:41.100> lucky<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.460> don't<00:03:41.550> have

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
music you're lucky I don't have

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.910 
music you're lucky I don't have
permissions<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.450> use<00:03:42.570> wrecking<00:03:43.020> ball<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.740> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
permissions to use wrecking ball or that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.210 
permissions to use wrecking ball or that
would<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.160> been<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.400> jam<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:47.100> do

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
would have been the jam so I really do

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.470 
would have been the jam so I really do
think<00:03:47.370> they<00:03:47.520> should<00:03:47.670> add<00:03:47.820> some<00:03:47.850> little<00:03:48.240> tone<00:03:48.450> I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
think they should add some little tone I

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.030 
think they should add some little tone I
mean<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:49.020> some<00:03:49.260> something<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.740> add<00:03:49.860> there

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
mean like some something to add there

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
mean like some something to add there
you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.460> like<00:03:50.550> some<00:03:50.730> boring

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you know it's just like some boring

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.640 
you know it's just like some boring
stuff<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.450> adds<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.960> little<00:03:52.050> bit<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.290> texture

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
stuff but adds a little bit of texture

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800 
stuff but adds a little bit of texture
to<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> map<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.360> everything<00:03:54.660> like

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
to that to the map and everything like

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.470 
to that to the map and everything like
that<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.830> that's<00:03:56.400> just<00:03:56.490> my<00:03:56.700> feeling<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
that but that's just my feeling the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.100 
that but that's just my feeling the
pp-2000<00:03:58.230> again<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.480> underestimated<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.840> not

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
pp-2000 again I underestimated but not

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.330 
pp-2000 again I underestimated but not
as<00:04:01.260> good<00:04:01.440> as<00:04:01.560> some<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.830> other<00:04:01.950> guns<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
as good as some of the other guns in the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.520 
as good as some of the other guns in the
game<00:04:02.630> again<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:03.780> area<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.140> expertise<00:04:04.500> of

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
game again it's area of expertise of

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.660 
game again it's area of expertise of
what<00:04:04.680> makes<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.040> good<00:04:05.070> as<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.430> fact<00:04:05.610> that

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
what makes it so good as the fact that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.580 
what makes it so good as the fact that
it's<00:04:05.850> got<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.030> 15<00:04:06.390> extra<00:04:06.690> bullets<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.170> it's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
it's got that 15 extra bullets and it's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.990 
it's got that 15 extra bullets and it's
a<00:04:07.650> little<00:04:07.830> bit<00:04:07.950> more<00:04:08.070> reliable<00:04:08.460> medium<00:04:08.790> range

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
a little bit more reliable medium range

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.490 
a little bit more reliable medium range
partially<00:04:09.540> because<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.960> got<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.110> slower<00:04:10.410> rate

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
partially because it's got a slower rate

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.980 
partially because it's got a slower rate
of<00:04:10.740> fire<00:04:10.890> than<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> mx4<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.750> also<00:04:12.780> means

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
of fire than the mx4 but that also means

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.180 
of fire than the mx4 but that also means
you<00:04:13.170> get<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.320> conserve<00:04:13.590> your<00:04:13.710> ammunition<00:04:13.920> a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you get to conserve your ammunition a

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.650 
you get to conserve your ammunition a
little<00:04:14.400> bit<00:04:14.490> more<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:14.790> where<00:04:14.910> there<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> con

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
little bit more so where there is a con

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.200 
little bit more so where there is a con
there's<00:04:15.990> also<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.230> positivity<00:04:16.850> part<00:04:17.850> about<00:04:18.150> it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
there's also a positivity part about it

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.940 
there's also a positivity part about it
where<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.750> get<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.050> use<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.500> longer<00:04:19.800> range

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
where you get to use it in longer range

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.010 
where you get to use it in longer range
situations<00:04:20.520> so<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.870> look<00:04:21.960> for

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
situations so if you want to look for

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.330 
situations so if you want to look for
something<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.800> be<00:04:22.830> great<00:04:23.100> at<00:04:23.190> close

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
something that can be great at close

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.040 
something that can be great at close
range<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.850> pretty<00:04:24.210> dominant<00:04:24.570> medium<00:04:24.870> range

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
range and pretty dominant medium range

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.790 
range and pretty dominant medium range
the<00:04:25.200> pp<00:04:25.470> may<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.920> thing<00:04:26.100> for<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.340> um<00:04:27.800> but
