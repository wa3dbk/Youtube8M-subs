00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
standard a right Corsair 5 up here is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.630 
standard a right Corsair 5 up here is
how<00:02:14.260> much<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.860> weight<00:02:15.010> difference<00:02:15.430> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
how much is the weight difference and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.490 
how much is the weight difference and
the<00:02:16.000> answer<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.599> almost<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.260> whole

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the answer to that is almost a whole

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.420 
the answer to that is almost a whole
half<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.950> pound

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
half a pound

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.339 
half a pound
now<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> standard<00:02:19.330> Corsair<00:02:19.750> 5<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.170> already

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
now that standard Corsair 5 is already

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.559 
now that standard Corsair 5 is already
not<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> very<00:02:21.129> heavy<00:02:21.640> helmets<00:02:22.060> about<00:02:22.209> 3<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
not a very heavy helmets about 3 and a

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.630 
not a very heavy helmets about 3 and a
half<00:02:22.660> pounds<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.560> one's<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.160> hair<00:02:24.430> over

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
half pounds this one's just a hair over

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.280 
half pounds this one's just a hair over
3

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
3

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.770 
3
right<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.829> 3<00:02:26.099> pounds<00:02:26.459> pretty<00:02:26.640> much<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.659> you're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
right at 3 pounds pretty much so you're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
right at 3 pounds pretty much so you're
looking<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.129> almost<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.310> full<00:02:29.579> half<00:02:29.819> pound

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
looking at almost a full half pound

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
looking at almost a full half pound
difference<00:02:30.359> and<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.109> could<00:02:31.230> say<00:02:31.409> with<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.799> on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
difference and I could say with it on

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
difference and I could say with it on
your<00:02:32.069> head<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.310> even<00:02:32.609> just<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:32.969> your<00:02:33.060> hands

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
your head and even just in your hands

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.170 
your head and even just in your hands
it's<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.140> significant<00:02:34.980> difference<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:36.090> of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
it's a significant difference and one of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's a significant difference and one of
the<00:02:36.239> best<00:02:36.450> things<00:02:36.659> about<00:02:36.750> arise<00:02:37.200> they<00:02:37.469> use

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the best things about arise they use

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860 
the best things about arise they use
this<00:02:37.769> peripheral<00:02:38.310> belting<00:02:38.879> technology<00:02:39.659> in

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
this peripheral belting technology in

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.780 
this peripheral belting technology in
their<00:02:40.079> shell<00:02:40.349> design<00:02:40.709> which<00:02:41.280> keeps<00:02:41.579> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
their shell design which keeps the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.720 
their shell design which keeps the
weight<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.810> shell<00:02:43.019> really<00:02:43.739> down<00:02:43.950> low<00:02:44.489> on

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
weight of the shell really down low on

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.339 
weight of the shell really down low on
your<00:02:44.909> head<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.390> center<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.720> gravity<00:02:46.170> is

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
your head so the center of gravity is

your head so the center of gravity is
very<00:02:46.379> low<00:02:47.780> reduces<00:02:48.780> neck<00:02:48.989> fatigue<00:02:49.349> for<00:02:49.620> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
very low reduces neck fatigue for you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.009 
very low reduces neck fatigue for you
guys<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.099> are<00:02:50.189> out<00:02:50.220> there<00:02:50.519> riding<00:02:51.420> hard<00:02:51.750> or

exact same style of ventilation you have

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.589 
exact same style of ventilation you have
basically<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.069> horseshoe<00:03:26.489> designed<00:03:26.909> intake

really cool and comfortable the biggest

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.390 
really cool and comfortable the biggest
thing<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.829> helmet<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
thing with this helmet is the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.729 
thing with this helmet is the
construction<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.329> shell<00:03:54.569> it's<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.620> know

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
construction of the shell it's you know

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.319 
construction of the shell it's you know
why<00:03:56.280> believe<00:03:56.519> carbon<00:03:56.940> fiber<00:03:57.120> there's

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
why believe carbon fiber there's

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.059 
why believe carbon fiber there's
actually<00:03:57.629> one<00:03:57.930> other<00:03:58.169> company<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.829> entire

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
actually one other company in the entire

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.710 
actually one other company in the entire
world<00:03:59.310> using<00:03:59.819> this<00:03:59.940> type<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.180> carbon<00:04:00.569> fiber

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.999 
they're all the details like that now
one<00:04:47.050> thing<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.229> makes<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.650> wide<00:04:47.830> weave

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
one thing that makes this wide weave

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.180 
one thing that makes this wide weave
carbon<00:04:48.430> fiber<00:04:48.610> really<00:04:49.210> special<00:04:49.919> if<00:04:50.919> you've

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
carbon fiber really special if you've

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.610 
carbon fiber really special if you've
ever<00:04:51.430> seen<00:04:52.360> somebody<00:04:52.840> with<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.110> carbon<00:04:53.410> fiber

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
ever seen somebody with a carbon fiber

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.469 
ever seen somebody with a carbon fiber
exhaust<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:54.370> crashed<00:04:54.729> their<00:04:54.970> motorcycle

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
exhaust that's crashed their motorcycle

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.909 
exhaust that's crashed their motorcycle
you've<00:04:55.630> probably<00:04:55.840> seen<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.199> carbon<00:04:56.710> fiber

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
you've probably seen that carbon fiber

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.310 
you've probably seen that carbon fiber
when<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.639> under<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> serious<00:04:58.810> impact<00:04:59.080> like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
when it's under a serious impact like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.890 
when it's under a serious impact like
that<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.710> shatters<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.430> cracks<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.330> breaks<00:05:01.599> and

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
that it shatters it cracks it breaks and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.050 
that it shatters it cracks it breaks and
obviously<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:03.009> a<00:05:03.099> helmet<00:05:03.430> that's<00:05:03.699> something

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
obviously in a helmet that's something

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.700 
obviously in a helmet that's something
you<00:05:04.150> clearly<00:05:04.419> don't<00:05:04.660> want<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.259> happen

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
you clearly don't want to have happen

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.730 
you clearly don't want to have happen
this<00:05:06.669> white<00:05:06.910> weave<00:05:07.120> carbon<00:05:07.539> fiber<00:05:07.780> has<00:05:08.380> enough

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
this white weave carbon fiber has enough

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.730 
this white weave carbon fiber has enough
flexibility<00:05:09.669> in<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.240> material<00:05:10.720> itself<00:05:11.080> to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
flexibility in the material itself to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.110 
flexibility in the material itself to
prevent<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.460> type<00:05:12.669> of<00:05:12.699> thing<00:05:12.970> from

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
prevent that type of thing from

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.790 
prevent that type of thing from
happening<00:05:13.270> so<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:14.050> actually<00:05:14.169> take<00:05:14.560> one

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
happening so you can actually take one

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.339 
happening so you can actually take one
of<00:05:14.889> these<00:05:14.979> strips<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.580> bend<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.349> obviously

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
of these strips and bend it obviously

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.900 
of these strips and bend it obviously
with<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.710> resin<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.250> all<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> layers<00:05:18.789> that

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
with the resin and all the layers that

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.370 
with the resin and all the layers that
they<00:05:19.060> put<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.419> into<00:05:19.690> that's<00:05:19.870> not<00:05:20.110> going<00:05:20.289> to

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
they put it into that's not going to

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.200 
they put it into that's not going to
it's<00:05:20.620> not<00:05:20.680> flexible<00:05:21.220> shell<00:05:21.550> by<00:05:21.699> any<00:05:21.910> means<00:05:22.120> I

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
it's not flexible shell by any means I

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.879 
it's not flexible shell by any means I
mean<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.419> can<00:05:22.570> push<00:05:22.750> on<00:05:22.900> this<00:05:22.990> as<00:05:23.169> extremely

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
mean you can push on this as extremely

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.040 
mean you can push on this as extremely
rigid<00:05:24.490> so<00:05:25.120> what<00:05:25.449> it's<00:05:25.570> going<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.840> do<00:05:25.960> is

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
rigid so what it's going to do is

the best job at dispersing the impact so

the best job at dispersing the impact so
they<00:06:05.409> have<00:06:05.530> to<00:06:05.650> use<00:06:05.770> more<00:06:06.009> than<00:06:06.159> just<00:06:06.220> carbon

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
they have to use more than just carbon

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.790 
they have to use more than just carbon
fiber<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.300> accomplish<00:06:07.720> that<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.289> only<00:06:08.470> thing

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
painstaking process that they put that

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.760 
painstaking process that they put that
they<00:06:29.919> go<00:06:30.070> through<00:06:30.210> takes<00:06:31.210> one<00:06:31.449> guy<00:06:31.659> ten<00:06:32.139> hours

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
they go through takes one guy ten hours

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.660 
they go through takes one guy ten hours
to<00:06:33.130> put<00:06:33.310> this<00:06:33.430> shell<00:06:33.669> together<00:06:33.849> which
