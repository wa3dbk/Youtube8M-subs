00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the one that happens all kids since 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.359
 we have one more time here and as you can see 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 we are once again in a new trick of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 online gta and good this trick because it goes to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
 consist basically in that we are going to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 make invisible mental and physical as 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 you are listening, what are we going to do 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.920
 invisible and it's very simple so 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 we go first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 good 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.510
 let's say that it will not go to the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.420
 First, it's because it cost us 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.060
 let's say things of about 15 or 20 minutes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.610
 but that in the end comes out that's a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.989
 clarification that I wanted to leave because more 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.180
 you're not going to leave one you're going to tell me 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 already directly uncle this does not work 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 is uncovering because we kids who 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 it just comes out the first time and it's 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.539
 that's why it's going to cost you say a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 little bit more and good as you see we are 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.559
 here in the custom saints that is where 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.719
 we are going to have to come and we are worth 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 let's say that one of us is going to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.960
 have to put in the parking is worth here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 within the many cults in the park 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.210
 let's say it's going to have to be a bit 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.979
 of synchronization because because of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
 while one of us is here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.190
 inside the other has 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.440
 be out on the ramp like I'm going to 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.860
 teach now good well here is let's say 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.510
 the ramp that I told everyone the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 you know what a blow I just gave him 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.710
 to the computer but that has not been heard 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.480
 and let's say we have to stay more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.870
 or less here is worth here for this 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.600
 we say that it did not work out 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.560
 from here to the first one it's worth 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's say that as it is a bit difficult 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 you have to take a bit of the site and the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.400
 point is worth to do well and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 let's say a little later 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 it comes out and well let's say that we 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 we were a little angry not because I did not 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.120
 we left but as you are going to see 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.979
 Now let's say he gave me to put me in 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.479
 another site is worth I put these cameras 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 fast so you can see what it is that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.070
 we did not leave at the first and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
 we take it there is a lot trying 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.750
 and as you see now here it's worth it then it gives me 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.180
 thousand for putting me here in this area 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 that was where we came from and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.619
 let's say we got it done if 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.690
 it seems impossible it seems incredible but 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.050
 if we manage to do more or less 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.950
 we synchronized we counted up to three 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.600
 let's say the method that we 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.910
 we use and as you see 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.830
 never collide with him we stay there a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.700
 little with the tires as you have 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.860
 seen and let's say that he is already invisible 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.480
 let's say that the one that leaves the saints 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.820
 it is just that which becomes invisible 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.800
 we do not now 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.520
 you will see now below in the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.590
 video like the let's say it mounts to the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.770
 truth endorses me hits me and attacks me with 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.330
 the car but I do not see it even in 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.000
 the minimap is worth as you see there they are 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.490
 pushing and on the minimap because as 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.770
 you see only I appear and my car 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.810
 which means that it is not 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.210
 lie, they're pushing me, they're 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.280
 doing everything and good I hope that you 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.230
 have liked the trick and see you in the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.230
 next video until next time
