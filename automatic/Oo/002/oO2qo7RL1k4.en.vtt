not just to remain active and to feel

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.160 
not just to remain active and to feel
better<00:02:43.950> even<00:02:44.670> though<00:02:44.790> she<00:02:44.849> can't<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.299> do

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
better even though she can't really do

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470
