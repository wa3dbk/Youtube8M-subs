well on the record and it's exactly what

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.470 
well on the record and it's exactly what
I<00:00:53.129> use<00:00:53.280> live<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> like

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I use live because it's got that like

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.130 
I use live because it's got that like
sort<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> darker<00:00:55.800> richer<00:00:56.190> tones<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.510> tend

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
sort of darker richer tones that I tend

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
sort of darker richer tones that I tend
to<00:00:58.260> gravitate<00:00:58.559> towards<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.399> opposed<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
to gravitate towards as opposed to the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.160 
to gravitate towards as opposed to the
more<00:01:00.600> shrill<00:01:01.050> brightness<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:03.019> which<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
more shrill brightness that and which is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
more shrill brightness that and which is
really<00:01:04.379> useful<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.790> not

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
really useful but but just not not

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840 
really useful but but just not not

guitar pianos hat is Harry Wright's and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.600 
guitar pianos hat is Harry Wright's and
he<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.020> able<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> record<00:02:31.680> lots<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> piano

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
he was able to record lots of the piano

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.670 
he was able to record lots of the piano
in<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.360> brought<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> tune<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.350> about

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
in there just brought a tune or about

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.290 
in there just brought a tune or about
the<00:02:34.800> piano<00:02:35.010> tuner<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.550> got<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.910> don't<00:02:36.090> every

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the piano tuner in got that don't every

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.480 
the piano tuner in got that don't every
couple<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.630> days<00:02:36.740> but<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.800> think<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.100> drum<00:02:38.310> room

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
couple of days but I think the drum room

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.110 
couple of days but I think the drum room
is<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:40.170> good<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.590> Westland<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.940> why

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
is really good in Westland and it's why

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
is really good in Westland and it's why
Rob<00:02:42.390> Kerwin<00:02:42.750> chose<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:44.160> definitely

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Rob Kerwin chose and it definitely

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
Rob Kerwin chose and it definitely
worked<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:44.880> really<00:02:45.030> good<00:02:45.120> for<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.780> this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
worked out really good for for this

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.200 
worked out really good for for this
record<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:47.130> which<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.490> Wilson<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.820> remember

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
record but which I can Wilson I remember

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.240 
record but which I can Wilson I remember
just<00:02:48.330> getting<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> demo<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.040> kind<00:02:50.220> of

just getting the demo and it was kind of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.800 
just getting the demo and it was kind of
was<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.520> syncopated<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.240> was<00:02:51.360> obvious<00:02:51.660> where

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
was so syncopated it was obvious where

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.310 
was so syncopated it was obvious where
the<00:02:51.900> did<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> sort<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.250> drum<00:02:54.050> pulled<00:02:55.050> some

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the did the sort of drum pulled some

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.600 
the did the sort of drum pulled some
distress<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.800> live<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.970> lay<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.870> there<00:02:58.490> but<00:02:59.490> we

distress as live or lay and there but we

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.040 
distress as live or lay and there but we
had<00:02:59.730> really<00:02:59.910> fun<00:03:00.060> recording<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.570> because<00:03:00.690> we

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
had really fun recording it because we

guitar<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.050> was<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.590> that

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
guitar and that was like you know that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.280 
guitar and that was like you know that
those<00:03:08.430> two<00:03:08.459> elements<00:03:08.910> weren't<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> track<00:03:09.390> in

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
those two elements weren't to track in

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.350 
those two elements weren't to track in
the<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.739> know<00:03:10.940> anything<00:03:11.940> sort<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
the for you know anything sort of the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.940 
the for you know anything sort of the
original<00:03:12.750> take<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.739> obviously

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
original take then it was obviously

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.250 
original take then it was obviously
later<00:03:14.130> for<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.459> guitars<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.720> was<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.170> was

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
later for more guitars but it was it was

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.449 
later for more guitars but it was it was
real<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.680> me<00:03:16.770> because<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> had<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.130> sense<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
real for me because I had that sense of

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.800 
real for me because I had that sense of
performance<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.270> from<00:03:18.420> start<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.780> finish

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
performance to it from start to finish

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.320 
performance to it from start to finish
you<00:03:19.230> know<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:20.010> fell<00:03:20.250> upon<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.760> kind<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.030> Swing

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
you know we fell upon this kind of Swing

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.710 
you know we fell upon this kind of Swing
thing<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> choruses<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:23.300> which<00:03:24.300> which<00:03:24.600> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
thing in the choruses and which which I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.479 
thing in the choruses and which which I
think<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.080> lifts<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> course<00:03:25.770> against

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
think really lifts the course against

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.160 
think really lifts the course against
you<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.910> kind<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.239> straight<00:03:27.600> piano<00:03:27.930> with

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
you got this kind of straight piano with

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.690 
you got this kind of straight piano with
the<00:03:28.260> swung<00:03:28.590> drum<00:03:28.890> beat<00:03:29.070> which<00:03:29.340> which<00:03:29.670> really

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
the swung drum beat which which really

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.290 
the swung drum beat which which really
gives<00:03:30.180> us<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:30.600> space<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.920> live<00:03:32.550> too<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.209> of
