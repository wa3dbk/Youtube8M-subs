00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.279 
right off and get some power back just
another<00:01:41.340> long<00:01:41.549> season<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.719> thought<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> be

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
another long season and I thought to be

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.990 
another long season and I thought to be
fair<00:01:43.530> burn<00:01:43.770> he's<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> better<00:01:44.700> team<00:01:44.969> for

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
fair burn he's got the better team for

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.899 
fair burn he's got the better team for
twenty<00:01:45.450> minutes<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.039> started<00:01:47.579> we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
twenty minutes and then we started we

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
twenty minutes and then we started we
just<00:01:48.420> started<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:48.990> our<00:01:49.469> staffing<00:01:49.890> gas<00:01:50.189> John

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just started this our staffing gas John

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.510 
just started this our staffing gas John
started<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> tell<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:52.439> said<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.859> clever<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
started to tell and I said to clever you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
started to tell and I said to clever you
know<00:01:53.549> thank<00:01:53.909> God<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.810> then

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
know thank God we got it right at then
and<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.340> training<00:01:56.640> paid<00:01:56.940> dividends

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and I think the training paid dividends

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.180 
and I think the training paid dividends
you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.870> killed<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.010> for

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
you know we killed them but it was for

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.160 
you know we killed them but it was for
today<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.690> with<00:02:00.810> 15

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
today and I think you know with 15

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.390 
today and I think you know with 15
minutes<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.440> go<00:02:01.590> he<00:02:01.710> got<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.950> third<00:02:02.130> goal

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
minutes to go he got the third goal

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640 
minutes to go he got the third goal
which<00:02:02.550> was<00:02:02.670> very<00:02:03.630> important<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> kill<00:02:04.410> him<00:02:04.530> off

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
which was very important to kill him off

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.290 
which was very important to kill him off
and<00:02:04.830> then<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:06.300> look<00:02:06.450> strong<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and then we really look strong and the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
and then we really look strong and the
