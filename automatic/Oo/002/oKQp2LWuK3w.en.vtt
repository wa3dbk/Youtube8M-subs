00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
ahead and switch sides one thing I do
want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.840> note<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.199> MLG<00:01:01.890> switched<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.489> to

there not a lot of teams go be the first
round<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.100> figured<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> did<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.119> rushed<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
round I figured if we did if we rushed a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.550 
round I figured if we did if we rushed a
the<00:01:42.600> first<00:01:42.810> round<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the first round they're gonna do the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
the first round they're gonna do the
same<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.970> did<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> prenatal<00:01:45.600> arches<00:01:46.259> as

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
same thing i did a prenatal arches as

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
same thing i did a prenatal arches as
you<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.710> seen<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.310> landed<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you just seen it landed right in the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.460 
you just seen it landed right in the
middle<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:48.899> good<00:01:48.990> Nate<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> do

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
middle that's a really good Nate to do

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.749 
middle that's a really good Nate to do
the<00:01:49.619> reason<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.890> did<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.640> figured

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the reason I did it is because I figured

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.980 
the reason I did it is because I figured
one<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> coming<00:01:51.899> behind<00:01:52.140> me<00:01:52.460> he<00:01:53.460> wasn't

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
one would be coming behind me he wasn't

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
one would be coming behind me he wasn't
so<00:01:54.990> unfortunately<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> did<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.310> kill

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so unfortunately I did not get that kill

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
so unfortunately I did not get that kill
as<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.810> left<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> right

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
as you can see I'm going left to right

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
as you can see I'm going left to right
left<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.189> pillars<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
left to right on these pillars here the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
left to right on these pillars here the
reason<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.840> stay<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
reason I don't stay on the right one and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.410 
reason I don't stay on the right one and
I<00:02:02.040> mainly<00:02:02.310> stand<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> left<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.149> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I mainly stand the left one is because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
I mainly stand the left one is because
you<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> can't<00:02:04.829> fully<00:02:05.070> see

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you don't know and you can't fully see

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
you don't know and you can't fully see
if<00:02:05.460> he<00:02:05.579> goes<00:02:05.700> bottom<00:02:06.060> bar<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.200> go

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
if he goes bottom bar and if they do go

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
if he goes bottom bar and if they do go
bottom<00:02:07.740> bar<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.069> top<00:02:08.310> bar<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:09.209> going

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
bottom bar and go top bar you're going

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.559 
bottom bar and go top bar you're going
to<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> disadvantage<00:02:10.349> of

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
to have a disadvantage of

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.130 
to have a disadvantage of
being<00:02:12.499> that<00:02:12.590> he's<00:02:12.769> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.980> top<00:02:13.159> window<00:02:14.140> he

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
being that he's on the top window he

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.030 
being that he's on the top window he
ended<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.349> coming<00:02:15.560> behind<00:02:15.709> me<00:02:15.889> on<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
ended up coming behind me on the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.399 
ended up coming behind me on the
fountain<00:02:16.310> here<00:02:16.579> and<00:02:17.569> somebody<00:02:17.989> picked<00:02:18.200> him<00:02:18.319> up

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
fountain here and somebody picked him up

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.679 
fountain here and somebody picked him up
I<00:02:18.620> think<00:02:18.829> it<00:02:18.889> was<00:02:18.950> mochila<00:02:19.329> good<00:02:20.329> thing<00:02:20.450> he<00:02:20.510> did

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
I think it was mochila good thing he did

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.020 
I think it was mochila good thing he did
because<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.930> probably<00:02:21.170> would<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.409> got<00:02:21.560> killed

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
because I probably would have got killed

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.190 
because I probably would have got killed
I<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.329> like<00:02:23.359> fighting<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.840> doorways<00:02:24.170> or

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
same strategy this time I needed maybe I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.319
