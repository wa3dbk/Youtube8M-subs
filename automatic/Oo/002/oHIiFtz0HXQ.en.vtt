Morgan and actually had never seen that
one<00:01:28.619> before<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.219> was<00:01:29.249> great<00:01:29.429> one<00:01:29.609> to<00:01:29.729> pick

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
one before so that was great one to pick

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.779 
one before so that was great one to pick
up<00:01:29.999> on<00:01:30.149> what<00:01:31.020> says<00:01:31.229> since<00:01:31.529> would<00:01:31.979> say<00:01:32.159> we'd<00:01:32.670> say

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
up on what says since would say we'd say

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.519 
up on what says since would say we'd say
you<00:01:32.849> finish<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.359> term<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> office<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.289> as

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:34.529 
you finish the term of office with as

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.649 
you finish the term of office with as
manageable<00:01:35.099> how<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.789> life<00:01:35.969> been<00:01:36.029> treating

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
manageable how has life been treating

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
manageable how has life been treating
you have<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> been<00:01:37.079> taking<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.469> easy<00:01:37.619> let's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you have you been taking it easy let's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
you have you been taking it easy let's
find<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.579> easy<00:01:38.819> actually<00:01:38.999> because<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.719> not

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
find very easy actually because I'm not

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.889 
find very easy actually because I'm not
doing<00:01:40.079> anything<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.499> like<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.539> suppose

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
doing anything at all like and I suppose

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.010 
doing anything at all like and I suppose
for<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.590> takes<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.859> bit<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:43.979> adjusting<00:01:44.399> because

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
for it takes a bit of adjusting because

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.419 
for it takes a bit of adjusting because
you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.139> you're<00:01:46.499> going<00:01:46.679> 100<00:01:47.069> miles<00:01:47.189> an<00:01:47.310> hour

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
you know you're going 100 miles an hour

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.190 
you know you're going 100 miles an hour
and<00:01:47.609> suddenly<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:47.969> gonna<00:01:48.149> normal<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:48.959> per

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and suddenly you're gonna normal as per

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.379 
and suddenly you're gonna normal as per
hour<00:01:49.289> so<00:01:49.529> I<00:01:49.919> found<00:01:50.669> a<00:01:50.819> little<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.179> change

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
hour so I found a little bit of a change

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.510 
hour so I found a little bit of a change
all<00:01:51.659> right<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.959> I've<00:01:52.049> enjoyed<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.469> you<00:01:53.369> know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
all right what I've enjoyed it you know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.440 
all right what I've enjoyed it you know
I<00:01:53.549> suppose<00:01:53.789> whether<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.209> it<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.359> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I suppose whether you like it or not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.629 
I suppose whether you like it or not
after<00:01:54.569> six<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.959> a<00:01:55.020> half<00:01:55.079> years<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.950> needed<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
after six and a half years I needed a

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.370 
after six and a half years I needed a
break<00:01:56.789> at<00:01:56.999> some<00:01:57.569> point<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.079> getting<00:01:58.319> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
break at some point and I'm getting it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
break at some point and I'm getting it
now<00:01:58.499> so<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.889> happy<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.489> it<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
now so I'm happy to have it but I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
now so I'm happy to have it but I
hopefully<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.539> for<00:02:00.569> too<00:02:00.689> long<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.499> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
hopefully not for too long when you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.379 
hopefully not for too long when you
stand<00:02:01.799> throat<00:02:02.039> as<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> PE<00:02:02.399> teacher<00:02:02.520> did<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
stand throat as a PE teacher did you

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.719 
stand throat as a PE teacher did you
think<00:02:03.599> it<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.749> going<00:02:03.959> to<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.169> that<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.579> no<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
think it was going to go that far no of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.429 
think it was going to go that far no of
course<00:02:05.999> you<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.209> at<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> time<00:02:07.139> I<00:02:07.289> was

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.809 
speculation once is a job arises but
that<00:04:08.560> job<00:04:08.739> hasn't<00:04:08.949> officially<00:04:09.310> arisen<00:04:09.699> yet

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
that job hasn't officially arisen yet

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.789 
that job hasn't officially arisen yet
anyway<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.239> think<00:04:10.449> I<00:04:10.629> think<00:04:10.989> it's<00:04:11.079> inevitable

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
anyway I think I think it's inevitable

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.039 
anyway I think I think it's inevitable
that<00:04:12.099> as<00:04:12.489> at<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:12.939> point<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.329> all<00:04:13.449> believe<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
that as at this point we all believe the

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.569 
that as at this point we all believe the
deklan's<00:04:14.439> go<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.709> become<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.979> irish<00:04:15.340> court

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
deklan's go on to become the irish court

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.180 
deklan's go on to become the irish court
and<00:04:15.849> rightly<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:17.019> could<00:04:17.199> create<00:04:17.349> that

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
and rightly so and I could create that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.580 
and rightly so and I could create that
that<00:04:19.030> they<00:04:19.540> can<00:04:19.720> see<00:04:19.870> what<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.110> suppose<00:04:20.380> it's

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that they can see what I suppose it's

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.170 
that they can see what I suppose it's
only<00:04:20.650> expected<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.340> people<00:04:21.610> join<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> dots

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
only expected that people join the dots

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.030 
only expected that people join the dots
but<00:04:22.840> from<00:04:23.200> my<00:04:23.320> own<00:04:23.440> point<00:04:23.620> ago<00:04:23.800> I've<00:04:23.860> heard

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
but from my own point ago I've heard

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.370 
but from my own point ago I've heard
nothing<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.520> IV<00:04:25.390> pretty<00:04:25.720> much<00:04:25.840> an<00:04:25.960> open<00:04:26.020> mind

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
nothing and IV pretty much an open mind

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.660 
nothing and IV pretty much an open mind
at<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.650> moment<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:27.070> don't<00:04:27.370> know<00:04:27.460> where<00:04:27.580> I'm

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670
