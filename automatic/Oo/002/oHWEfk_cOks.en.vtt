00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.710
 an interesting one that I also feel 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.119
 I kawhi leonard 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 less defensively the new table 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 sefolosha has a different pace however in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 attack does more than thabo the new one 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.890
 however bowen three times four times 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 five times stronger in attack 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.269
 federico in defense are thabo io fans 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.519
 I'm a thabo fan. I think I was in 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.949
 this moment is one of the first of the 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.960
 bryant track you earn every point you 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.820
 marks and very intelligent and structured 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 there may be a comparison of this kind though 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 to be the first year actually 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.030
 that other longer and more advanced the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.039
 moment between tough walls and this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.469
 play pivot for real at high school 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.449
 it's a player it's amazing and more 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.129
 time passes plus this will improve e 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.489
 this is serious for others of course 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 enrico I would be on only one spurs 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 gold tour I remember it in san diego 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 been was not as disciplined as it seemed 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 a savage like he did in so little 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 time to put it in a system like this a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 riverside played pivot at high school 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.440
 ie here suddenly a small wing 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 because because the expenses are good and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.979
 sometimes I was also lucky because 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
 guys is not so obvious when you have 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.030
 got a wing here says that these in three 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.920
 months becomes this player also for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.079
 the iss for sure that they in the lab 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 counter work better than others 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.729
 teams and above all make you understand 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 what it takes to stay in this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 team 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 the other day I read Gattuso saying 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.409
 and vacua and sharaawy responds to mine 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.409
 times when i was under maldini e 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 I didn't answer via scharoun e 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.210
 my dinners are 150 spurs have them 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.829
 had one have 12 you answer once 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 and you are given the yellow answer the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.399
 second pink arrives and you close between 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340
 he shook her head 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.539
 no no no he shook his head because 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 sharaawy is called from juan blair is 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.100
 the only one who answers waits for that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.969
 check government we should have seen it 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.439
 many zeros 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.910
 I liked that guy who was there 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.220
 at the beginning of the season the Canadian run 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 giosef one day bank says this not 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 I like the others with the notebook gone
