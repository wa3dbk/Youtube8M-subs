00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.500
 [Music] 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.250
 the enterprise had one more 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.470
 helmsman 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.540
 We are here light years away 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.920
 laugh at such humane obstacles 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 the engineers of mercedes only 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.699
 still dead a click on the phone is enough 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.830
 and the f 0 15 slides without 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.680
 driver alone with only one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 electronics amada equipped and one 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.380
 Design this from another galaxy too 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 it seems that it is the s 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 class of about the day after tomorrow they are 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.829
 not only futuristic out of it, too 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 a lot of what you just not now 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.730
 can drive autonomously even completely 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.500
 alone steers the machine controlled 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 are gas now he sits still peter 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 Lehmann or is he sitting there 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.390
 safety reasons that means these 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.590
 Machine will be right through us 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.600
 The only thing I drive 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 need for this is trust and this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 I have to trust the car first 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
 work out 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is on a closed airfield 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 a little easier no surrounding traffic 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 and already stored obstacles 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 here is the f 0 15 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 First prove that he 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.089
 basically able alone is too 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.140
 drive 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.179
 that's a bit weird 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 right now also with the back to 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.770
 roadway to sit and drive the car 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.359
 he just does not sit at the wheel 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.729
 The fathers next to me who is there but 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.200
 he ultimately does nothing and thereby 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.490
 We have time to entertain ourselves 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.329
 have time to give you this car too 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.909
 to bring closer 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.920
 but the car can do much more than that 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.200
 just drive when the landscape 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.000
 on the airfield becomes boring then 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.539
 you can for example show the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.770
 to change 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.270
 you do not have to look at it anymore 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 concentrate what's out there 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.849
 going 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 led lights computer displays in the 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.530
 Internet surfing is all about it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.090
 long strapped I can stay 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 the complainers already hear the saying 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.780
 I would like to own my car myself 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.879
 I do not think that driving though 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.869
 you have such a car what autonomous driving 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.869
 you can really drive yourself 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.429
 but would like it, I would go should the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.069
 unfortunately not personally because I have 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.379
 no super license of peter lehmann der 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.060
 has what can the car have that 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.520
 he under the hood 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.719
 our eyes are good 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.500
 the entrance is behind he has 200 kw 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.420
 electrical 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.360
 that first 272 260 ps and he puts of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.290
 over 100 goes the Rhaetian 6.7 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.630
 seconds from 0 to 100 and 272 ps 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.530
 the rest also so little from there is 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.290
 it is sufficient 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 It's fun to dare too 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.550
 but only for a short time 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.190
 this f 0 stores 15 of its energy 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.990
 in two battery packs from the electro smart 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.700
 and they do not last very long 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.170
 but in the future they will get one 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.390
 fuel cell 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.400
 this 2 million euro expensive 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 single pieces is just a concept 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.110
 The reality of this is mercedes 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 convinced for the future department at 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.790
 daimler it is not a question of whether 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 or when, but how does it look like? 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.050
 How do I bring this automation in 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.270
 our society into it us 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.850
 I enjoy it and that's it 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.830
 essential that the one 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.600
 So communication is a kind 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.550
 language is designed between us and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.770
 the vehicles but not thought now 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.510
 from the inside here the driver or something 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.580
 but from the outside so if so 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.130
 vehicle comes as is and communicates 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.810
 How do I know where I want to go? 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.690
 that's why the s-class projects the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.670
 future eg zebra crossing on the asphalt 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.680
 as a confidence-building measure 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.290
 so to speak and as a signal that it is the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.180
 By the way, pedestrian has already recognized 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 when the computer goes to change 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.230
 color the front leds on blue when on 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.160
 man then takes the tax 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.650
 they shine white 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.200
 so you know from the outside who is there 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.400
 is actually driving on a train 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 Of course, that's not all new 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.970
 what mercedes here shows the sensors 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.950
 we already have technical components 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.930
 seen at other manufacturers bmw and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.610
 audi have shown something like google and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.280
 Apple working on self-driving cars 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.870
 that alone is not new but mercedes 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.730
 has everything here in one dare 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.390
 led together and that is that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.620
 exciting about it 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.650
 That's why I want to go back 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.590
 back to the future 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.110
 and this future begins according to mercedes 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.610
 right now with distance radar and dust 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.980
 follow assistants is already part 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.340
 autonomous driving possible in 15 years 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.769
 So 2030 then this vision 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.759
 have reached the production stage children 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.500
 now come to the world 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.139
 maybe never a driver's license 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.880
 if yes, if the laws 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.299
 is allow 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.299
