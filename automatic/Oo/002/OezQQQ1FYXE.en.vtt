00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.600
 today talk about barbeskew horn worth 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.610
 buy or better refrain and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 buy something else tell you about my 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.990
 operating experience of this unit 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.920
 my motorcycle yes yes motorcycle 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.259
 he has pts 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.149
 He is 2 years old and I skated a lot 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.550
 two full seasons or four and a half 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.530
 thousand kilometers what happened to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 him the weather is very strong 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.309
 stretched goal removed two links but 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.380
 seems to have to change it to the word 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 front star is also no yes 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.270
 back dampers changed four times 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.310
 fail very quickly stores 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.340
 sell frank shit and silicone 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.260
 sort of laying off I advise them all 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.970
 replacement of piston rings on run three with 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 half a thousand kilometers but this is mine 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.840
 an error occurred due to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 insufficient oil level in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 In general, then perhaps everything except 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 all sorts of little things like replacing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.479
 cable and the like what are the advantages 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.369
 This device is inexpensive enough 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.259
 powerful light for my class 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.729
 compare it with Minsk he is in everything 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.350
 slightly inferior but created 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.640
 the impression that making the first alpha 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 the Chinese are exactly Minsk tried 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
 copy it a little weight and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.340
 obedience will play on hand 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
 newbies but newbies a little later 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 Perhaps the benefits are no longer now 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.870
 let's talk about the cons now they have 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.000
 PTS 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.590
 and they think with motorcycles they are mopeds 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420
 it can radically affect 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.159
 the upcoming purchase is worth having it 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.940
 in view of 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.940
 disgusting shock absorbers 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660
 if you want to change, I advise you just from 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.980
 them water 40 pump water drops or 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.260
 you can't hear the dust of the floor 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.510
 far from good workmanship 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.610
 parts and their strength but it is low 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.130
 price category so how much do we pay 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.960
 so much we get a terrible structure 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.360
 air filter all who had with him 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.340
 at least some business understands what I'm on 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.220
 filter replacement may take from 10 minutes to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.229
 hours a big chance to get a brother to anyone 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.210
 It is no secret that the purchase of Chinese matter 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.900
 or motorcycle are peculiar 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.060
 lucky and no baggage gram again 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.310
 all the same nagging quality metal 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.310
 bad thin brie load does not go long 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.349
 what does the conclusion say many say 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.410
 what is this layout 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.840
 well, or the bike is basically good 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.030
 focusing on what they buy 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.849
 newbies personally my opinion is that this 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.130
 perfect gibberish up to buy it newbies 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.480
 but as stated above with quality 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.700
 workmanship and quality in general 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.190
 materials used in Russia horns 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.319
 after falling even at a speed of 30 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.569
 kilometers per hour you can bend the wheel of dope 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.569
 which in theory should protect but 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.830
 instead they just bend easily 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.569
 footboards are not the ones that rely 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.790
 motorcycle is it worth it which you 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.370
 put your legs attached to the crankcase which is very 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.530
 not good and also bend from falls so 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 which may well be attributed to the minuses in 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.220
 In general, as you probably already understood my 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.410
 The attitude to the horns of the iphone is not quite 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.120
 positive because of two years I have a lot 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.720
 experienced with him and want to say that only 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.880
 you decide 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.069
 can save some money buy 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.900
 An old decided Minsk but it also does not 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.569
 gives you guarantees that in a month and down 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.150
 catch a wedge you can also throw money and 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.920
 take irbis ttr 125 or go to them i 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.140
 I'm warm enough but they too 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.900
 have their drawbacks about this wagon in 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.910
 separate video in general choice to do 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.739
 only you do not listen to anyone because 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.109
 nothing is perfect and he has his 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.030
 disadvantages and this video is only for 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.940
 order to case of purchase you know what 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.380
 beware write in comments if i 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.239
 forgot something and ask your 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.329
 questions in the VKontakte group link in 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.329
