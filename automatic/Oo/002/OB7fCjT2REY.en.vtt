00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.699
 hello girls welcome to mommy colo like 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.699
 they are hello 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.520
 well we have a very video 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.970
 interesting and it's with tips for how 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.900
 dress because sometimes we are like 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.119
 find us and know what little things 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.099
 we will put over or add you or what 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.050
 do then here are going to be four 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.760
 very practical tips if fast for 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.529
 that you can dress better is Carlos 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.840
 with profit then first 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.820
 we need to start with a piece that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.410
 stand out with your you are going to dress up you have 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.540
 to say good I think my jacket 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.090
 be it with what is the coolest or my dress 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.920
 that is what I highlight my pants this 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.600
 is based on what you are deciding 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.730
 you are going to work on the rest of the look 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.800
 so that I have an example in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.600
 I live if they are like this pants 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.540
 flowers that have been seen my 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 mmt fashion videos I have one flowered 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.309
 but there is a clear tone and then this 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.430
 it's a darker one obviously like I do not know 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.270
 it puts this it shows quite tone then 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.930
 this would be my approach so I could not 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.600
 be a white shirt some gray this 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 a jacket over some booties so 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.110
 remaining in a little bit more and then 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.480
 this or keep it all toned 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.640
 neutral dark gray black 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.460
 whites then from there you go 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 working then you have to go 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.220
 focusing what is yours number two 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.760
 we are mixing different styles that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 what says who you are because that's 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.570
 what we want to highlight who you are 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.790
 so that's why I bring this shirt 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.010
 not that it is so very that you can use for the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.040
 work but if I want to be a 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.740
 little bit cooler and I wear a skirt 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.900
 with sequins short and then yes 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.450
 I put some heels on booties and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.210
 then it immediately and change the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.550
 serious look of what I bring 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.500
 adding that skirt is mix anima 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.560
 if you want to wear those sneakers with a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.470
 integrated taconcito if you want this one not 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 is to add another thing not as well as 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.400
 that for these to combine in their 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.650
 different styles you can do it like this 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.240
 who sees the photos that I'm going to put 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.030
 Have an idea of how to do 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.160
 then the third point is to add 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.350
 unique accessories 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 I'm probably going to be criticized a lot 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.200
 laugh the radio of me but it is that this is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.270
 what I like and for example this 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.060
 it's a public accessory and I do not have a 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.100
 mirror here in front of you but they 're going to 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.410
 see that they will see the top before more than 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.000
 what is the next year and this is a 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.470
 simple way to be able to be 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.760
 obviously it can not be further back and not 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.140
 I know what, but since I'm not seeing myself, 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.690
 I have a product cabinet and watching 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.800
 right now but this is a unique accessory 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.140
 other unique accessories for example is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.450
 I got a bracelet from a friend 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.240
 South of Mexico is made from 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.640
 seeds and pest machines around 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.190
 arm with these bracelets or you see 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.650
 super unique nobody is going to bring who's going 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.840
 to bring these these very original as 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 You can at the same time with other bracelets and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 of colors a necklace and big that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.500
 highlight that those are your accessories 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.910
 unique and it does not matter that even if I had 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.670
 the feast of the torch bring to the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.680
 same the same reason as you if you 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.020
 you add those accessories that are yours 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.500
 that are unique you let see totally 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.000
 different ok and the number 4 ends all 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.210
 with a leather jacket though 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.900
 obviously but imitation skin always 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.550
 It gives that a look and a look as well as that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.650
