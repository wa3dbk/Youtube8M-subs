00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
video clip I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.070 
video clip I'm going to teach you how to
fold<00:00:07.080> my<00:00:07.700> double<00:00:08.750> star<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.929> david'<00:00:11.960> for<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
fold my double star of david' for that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.000 
fold my double star of david' for that
we<00:00:13.259> need<00:00:13.440> six<00:00:14.070> units<00:00:14.210> I'm<00:00:15.210> using<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.990> two<00:00:16.320> side<00:00:16.619> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we need six units I'm using a two side a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.769 
we need six units I'm using a two side a
dual<00:00:17.550> core<00:00:17.910> akame<00:00:18.590> with<00:00:19.910> green<00:00:20.910> light<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
dual core akame with green light and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.910 
dual core akame with green light and
dark<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.740> both<00:00:23.039> sides<00:00:24.260> so<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.289> start<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
dark on both sides so we start with the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.410 
dark on both sides so we start with the
first<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.920> fold<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.220> half<00:00:32.300> open<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
first one we do fold it by half open it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.250 
first one we do fold it by half open it
up<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.890> turn<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> over<00:00:35.450> rotate<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
up and turn it over rotate and do it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.819 
up and turn it over rotate and do it
again<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:39.890> we<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.100> both<00:00:41.600> green<00:00:42.600> valley<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
again so we have both green valley and a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.840 
again so we have both green valley and a
mountainful<00:00:44.309> lines<00:00:44.870> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.200> square<00:00:46.700> next<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
mountainful lines on the square next is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.889 
mountainful lines on the square next is
to<00:00:48.090> mark<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> quarter<00:00:49.530> sign<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> pinch

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
to mark the quarter sign here on a pinch

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
to mark the quarter sign here on a pinch
and<00:00:54.899> next<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.629> some

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and next we are going to do some

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.740 
and next we are going to do some
diagonals<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.180> go

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
diagonals actually what we need is to go

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
diagonals actually what we need is to go
from<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> center<00:01:02.579> line<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.030> then

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
from here to the center line and then

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380 
from here to the center line and then
again<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.739> continue<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> line<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.240> can

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
again if you continue the line you can

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.070 
again if you continue the line you can
go<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.810> going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
go all the way to here and this is going

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.859 
go all the way to here and this is going
to<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> mountain<00:01:10.830> fold<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.979> like<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
to be a mountain fold so I like to do it

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
to be a mountain fold so I like to do it
with<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> pinch<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.310> those

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
with a pinch this way so we have those

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.690 
with a pinch this way so we have those
two<00:01:26.820> lines<00:01:27.000> turn<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> over<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.430> align<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
two lines turn it over and align the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.440 
two lines turn it over and align the
edges<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> new<00:01:30.780> crease<00:01:31.049> line<00:01:33.020> since<00:01:34.020> one

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
edges with the new crease line since one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.630 
edges with the new crease line since one
and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.960> two

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.850 

go<00:01:40.210> back<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.720> side<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.290> now<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.710> going

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
go back to the side and now we are going

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.030 
go back to the side and now we are going
to<00:01:42.160> collapse<00:01:42.490> by<00:01:43.150> using<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.720> valley<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
to collapse by using the valley and the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.540 
to collapse by using the valley and the
two<00:01:45.190> mountain<00:01:45.640> fold<00:01:45.940> lines<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.950> this

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.610 

this<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.730> almost<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.360> end<00:01:52.390> now<00:01:52.870> we<00:01:52.930> align<00:01:53.380> this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
this is almost the end now we align this

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:03.180 
this is almost the end now we align this
edge<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.780> center<00:01:55.810> line<00:02:01.620> we<00:02:02.620> open<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.040> up

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
edge to the center line we open it up

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.860 
edge to the center line we open it up
and<00:02:03.720> then<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:05.500> do<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:06.090> line<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.120> fold<00:02:07.510> line<00:02:07.570> from

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
and then we do a line a fold line from

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.000 
and then we do a line a fold line from
here<00:02:08.260> to<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.100> point<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.290> almost<00:02:14.680> done

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
here to this point we are almost done

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.220 
here to this point we are almost done
with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.490> first<00:02:15.610> unit<00:02:16.500> now<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.930> fold<00:02:19.930> those

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
with the first unit now I fold those

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:28.949 
with the first unit now I fold those
flaps<00:02:21.060> inside<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:26.760> big<00:02:27.760> fist<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.420> fall<00:02:28.690> down

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
flaps inside I big fist this fall down

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.720 
flaps inside I big fist this fall down
because<00:02:29.350> there<00:02:29.740> are<00:02:29.830> two<00:02:30.010> layers<00:02:30.250> inside

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
because there are two layers inside

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.390 
because there are two layers inside
which<00:02:31.030> are<00:02:31.209> not<00:02:31.390> twists<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.800> enforced

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
which are not twists so I just enforced

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.130 
which are not twists so I just enforced
this<00:02:33.550> one<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.810> inside<00:02:35.740> reverse<00:02:35.800> fold

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
this one and then inside reverse fold

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.030 
this one and then inside reverse fold
and<00:02:38.140> voila

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
and voila

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.220 
and voila
we<00:02:39.160> are<00:02:39.280> done<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> unit<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.080> to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
we are done this is the unit we have to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.390 
we are done this is the unit we have to
make<00:02:41.410> six<00:02:41.680> now<00:02:42.580> I'm<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.120> make<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.220> one

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
make six now I'm going to make the one

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.820 
make six now I'm going to make the one
with<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.030> color<00:02:46.239> side<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.600> dark<00:02:49.989> green

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:03.449 
with the color side with the dark green
up<00:02:51.160> or<00:02:51.459> outside<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:54.720> two<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:58.620> then<00:03:02.190> pinch<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
up or outside so two and then pinch to

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
up or outside so two and then pinch to
the<00:03:04.150> quarter

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
the quarter

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.040 
the quarter
pinch<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.709> quarter<00:03:09.600> mountain<00:03:10.600> from<00:03:10.989> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
pinch the quarter mountain from the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.699 
pinch the quarter mountain from the
pinch<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> center<00:03:12.670> line<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:15.239> again<00:03:16.709> on

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
pinch to the center line and again on

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.990 
pinch to the center line and again on
the<00:03:17.920> other<00:03:17.950> side

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.260 

align<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.360> edges<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> nucleus<00:03:24.100> lines<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
align the edges to the nucleus lines and

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:44.400

fold<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.410> now<00:04:05.440> we<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.340> two<00:04:07.150> units<00:04:09.450> I've<00:04:10.450> made

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
fold and now we have two units I've made

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.850 
fold and now we have two units I've made
all<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.830> six<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.280> them<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:13.380> now<00:04:14.380> it's<00:04:14.590> time<00:04:14.800> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
all the six of them and now it's time to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.330 
all the six of them and now it's time to
assemble<00:04:15.130> on<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.700> units<00:04:16.739> what<00:04:17.739> we<00:04:17.860> have<00:04:18.070> here

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
assemble on the units what we have here

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.030 
assemble on the units what we have here
is<00:04:18.489> actually<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:19.150> tab<00:04:19.690> this<00:04:20.260> is<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.590> tab<00:04:20.830> and

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
is actually a tab this is the tab and

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.290 
is actually a tab this is the tab and
the<00:04:21.790> pocket<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.390> it's<00:04:23.050> right<00:04:23.350> here<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:25.060> is

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the pocket is it's right here this is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.500 
the pocket is it's right here this is
actually<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.780> pocket<00:04:26.140> so<00:04:26.380> I'm<00:04:27.420> putting<00:04:28.420> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
actually the pocket so I'm putting the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.890 
actually the pocket so I'm putting the
tab<00:04:28.780> into<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.440> pocket<00:04:30.030> making<00:04:31.030> sure<00:04:31.390> it<00:04:31.600> goes

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
tab into the pocket making sure it goes

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.340 
tab into the pocket making sure it goes
symmetrical<00:04:32.770> here<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.280> then<00:04:33.970> I'm<00:04:34.210> using<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
symmetrical here and then I'm using the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.310 
symmetrical here and then I'm using the
next<00:04:35.740> tab<00:04:35.980> to<00:04:36.850> go<00:04:37.060> into<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.570> next<00:04:37.780> units

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
next tab to go into the next units

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.780 
next tab to go into the next units
pocket<00:04:39.600> again<00:04:40.600> making<00:04:41.230> sure<00:04:41.410> it's<00:04:41.770> in<00:04:42.520> the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
pocket again making sure it's in the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.990 
pocket again making sure it's in the
center<00:04:43.470> dark<00:04:44.470> one

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.900 

just<00:04:52.000> open<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.540> up<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:53.650> little<00:04:53.830> bit<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.670> have<00:04:54.880> a

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
just open it up a little bit to have a
