00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.280 
whenever you do a setup like this I
always<00:03:13.150> think<00:03:13.450> about<00:03:13.660> doing<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.989> reverse

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
always think about doing the reverse

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.640 
always think about doing the reverse
shot<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.519> can<00:03:15.670> loosen<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.180> up<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.660> turn

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
shot so you can loosen this up and turn

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.680 
shot so you can loosen this up and turn
it<00:03:17.769> around<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.810> frame<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.230> back<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:21.660> lock<00:03:22.660> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it around and frame it back up lock it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.630 
it around and frame it back up lock it
and<00:03:23.290> now<00:03:23.709> you've<00:03:23.920> got<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.100> shot<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.519> driver

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and now you've got a shot of the driver

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.520 
and now you've got a shot of the driver
and<00:03:25.090> everybody<00:03:25.810> else<00:03:25.989> around<00:03:26.110> them<00:03:26.410> people

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and everybody else around them people

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.490 
and everybody else around them people
passing<00:03:26.860> them<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.510> does<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.930> small<00:03:29.110> zoom

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
passing them this does have a small zoom

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
passing them this does have a small zoom
on<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.340> get<00:03:30.519> in<00:03:30.610> tight<00:03:30.820> if<00:03:31.000> you

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
on it so you can get in tight if you

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.340 
on it so you can get in tight if you
want<00:03:33.030> most<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.239> footage<00:03:34.420> looks<00:03:34.840> nicer<00:03:35.200> if

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
want most of the footage looks nicer if

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.289 
want most of the footage looks nicer if
it's<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> little<00:03:35.680> bit<00:03:35.769> wider<00:03:35.890> however<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.150> is

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
it's a little bit wider however this is

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.970 
it's a little bit wider however this is
kind<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.570> an<00:03:37.690> interesting<00:03:37.900> shot<00:03:38.290> we've<00:03:38.950> got

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
kind of an interesting shot we've got

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.170 
kind of an interesting shot we've got
the<00:03:39.250> chrome<00:03:39.459> here<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.820> side<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the chrome here on the side of the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.390 
the chrome here on the side of the
muffler<00:03:40.360> we've<00:03:41.140> got<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.560> wheel<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:42.190> course

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
muffler we've got the wheel of course

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.860 
muffler we've got the wheel of course
you've<00:03:42.489> got<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.609> pavement<00:03:43.060> going<00:03:43.359> by<00:03:43.540> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you've got the pavement going by and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.470 
you've got the pavement going by and
probably<00:03:44.590> some<00:03:44.769> cool<00:03:44.980> little<00:03:45.280> artifacts<00:03:46.269> from

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
probably some cool little artifacts from

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.080 
probably some cool little artifacts from
the<00:03:46.660> spokes<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.140> they<00:03:47.260> spin<00:03:47.500> through<00:03:47.739> frame<00:03:48.090> as

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
the spokes as they spin through frame as

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.030 
the spokes as they spin through frame as
a<00:03:49.269> particular<00:03:49.590> angle<00:03:50.590> we<00:03:50.680> have<00:03:50.709> here<00:03:50.980> is

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
a particular angle we have here is

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.009 
a particular angle we have here is
called<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.340> Dutch<00:03:51.579> meaning<00:03:52.180> an<00:03:52.299> in-frame<00:03:52.720> it's

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
called a Dutch meaning an in-frame it's

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.509 
called a Dutch meaning an in-frame it's
going<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.290> be<00:03:53.380> off<00:03:53.590> off<00:03:53.920> kilter

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
going to be off off kilter

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.120 
going to be off off kilter
but<00:03:55.390> stuff<00:03:55.930> like<00:03:56.079> this<00:03:56.200> looks<00:03:56.500> real<00:03:56.829> cool

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
but stuff like this looks real cool

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.920 
but stuff like this looks real cool
especially<00:03:57.430> when<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.000> cut<00:03:58.209> together

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
especially when you have it cut together

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.449 
especially when you have it cut together
with<00:03:59.200> regular<00:03:59.769> traditional<00:04:00.220> straight

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
with regular traditional straight

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.150 
with regular traditional straight
footage<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.810> then<00:04:02.320> we<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.560> also<00:04:02.680> take<00:04:02.980> this

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
footage and then we can also take this

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.150 
footage and then we can also take this
camera<00:04:03.489> at<00:04:03.579> this<00:04:03.700> point<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.269> tilt<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.079> up<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
camera at this point and tilt it up and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.130 
camera at this point and tilt it up and
we<00:04:06.370> should<00:04:06.400> have<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:07.060> nice<00:04:07.299> clean<00:04:07.660> view

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
we should have a really nice clean view

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.840 
we should have a really nice clean view
looking<00:04:08.500> straight<00:04:08.829> back<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.400> maybe<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.760> little

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
looking straight back and maybe a little

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.670 
looking straight back and maybe a little
bit<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.299> muffler<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:10.870> can<00:04:11.170> also<00:04:11.350> set<00:04:11.650> it

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
bit of the muffler you can also set it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.500 
bit of the muffler you can also set it
so<00:04:11.859> it<00:04:11.950> looks<00:04:12.100> off<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.549> side<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> little<00:04:12.940> so

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
so it looks off to the side a little so

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.759 
so it looks off to the side a little so
if<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.750> want<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.989> set<00:04:14.170> up<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.350> shot<00:04:14.560> where<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
if you want to set up a shot where you

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.620 
if you want to set up a shot where you
have<00:04:14.950> people<00:04:15.130> passing<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.880> on<00:04:15.910> your<00:04:16.299> left

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
have people passing you on your left

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.969 
have people passing you on your left
side<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:18.310> reposition<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.120> camera<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.830> so

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
side just reposition the camera and so

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.350 
side just reposition the camera and so
here<00:04:24.190> we<00:04:24.250> got<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.400> straight<00:04:24.760> shot<00:04:24.789> looking

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
here we got a straight shot looking

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.640 
here we got a straight shot looking
backwards<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
backwards and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.219 
backwards and
for<00:04:27.919> a<00:04:27.949> nice<00:04:28.070> clean<00:04:28.310> POV<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.960> can<00:04:30.050> frame

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
for a nice clean POV and you can frame

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.100 
for a nice clean POV and you can frame
this<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> rack<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.460> out<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.900> we<00:04:32.990> can

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
this so the rack is is out and we can

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.020 
this so the rack is is out and we can
probably<00:04:33.260> even<00:04:33.560> mount<00:04:33.919> this<00:04:34.070> camera<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.550> this

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
probably even mount this camera on this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.180 
probably even mount this camera on this
particular<00:04:35.360> rack<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.990> rear<00:04:36.169> as<00:04:36.320> well<00:04:36.350> but

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
particular rack in the rear as well but

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.860 
particular rack in the rear as well but
this<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.550> kind<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.880> interesting<00:04:38.180> too<00:04:38.600> we<00:04:38.720> can

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
this is kind of interesting too we can

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.320 
this is kind of interesting too we can
flip<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.169> camera<00:04:39.590> around<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.280> now<00:04:41.060> look

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
flip this camera around and now look

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.650 
flip this camera around and now look
underneath<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:43.250> writers<00:04:43.580> arm<00:04:43.970> looking

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
underneath the writers arm looking

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.689 
underneath the writers arm looking
straight<00:04:44.990> forward<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.889> it'll<00:04:46.040> be<00:04:46.160> under<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
straight forward so it'll be under the

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.730 
straight forward so it'll be under the
armpit<00:04:47.090> shot<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:48.139> that's<00:04:48.380> something<00:04:48.560> that

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
armpit shot and that's something that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.320 
armpit shot and that's something that
you<00:04:48.800> don't<00:04:48.949> normally<00:04:49.100> see<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:49.880> think<00:04:50.000> that

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
you don't normally see if you think that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.400 
you don't normally see if you think that
I<00:04:50.360> try<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.600> think<00:04:50.750> last<00:04:50.990> time<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.229> saw<00:04:51.380> a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
I try to think last time you saw a

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.490 
I try to think last time you saw a
camera<00:04:51.740> mounted<00:04:52.010> like<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:53.380> one<00:04:54.380> thing

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
camera mounted like that one thing

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.140 
camera mounted like that one thing
that's<00:04:54.650> kind<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.860> cool<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.220> that<00:04:55.250> since<00:04:55.639> most

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
that's kind of cool is that since most

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.530 
that's kind of cool is that since most
new<00:04:56.570> editing<00:04:57.020> systems<00:04:57.440> have<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.860> ability<00:04:58.250> to

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
new editing systems have the ability to

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.409 
new editing systems have the ability to
flip<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.810> image<00:05:00.199> we<00:05:01.039> can<00:05:01.220> now<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.180> just

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
flip the image we can now do this just

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.810 
flip the image we can now do this just
for<00:05:02.479> fun<00:05:02.630> we<00:05:02.930> can<00:05:03.020> hang<00:05:03.289> this<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.130> it's<00:05:04.610> pretty

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
for fun we can hang this and it's pretty

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.340 
for fun we can hang this and it's pretty

wide though we can now we move this over

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.409 
wide though we can now we move this over
to<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.590> center<00:05:06.889> as<00:05:07.010> well<00:05:07.190> but<00:05:08.000> we<00:05:08.120> get<00:05:08.300> this

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
to the center as well but we get this

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.620 
to the center as well but we get this
shot<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.229> parcel<00:05:09.910> license<00:05:10.910> plate<00:05:11.150> and

that's<00:05:14.960> being<00:05:15.110> recorded<00:05:15.470> upside<00:05:15.949> down<00:05:16.220> but

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
that's being recorded upside down but
