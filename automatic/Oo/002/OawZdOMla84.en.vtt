00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.819 
milk to the rule that you bring it up to
a<00:00:28.669> boiling<00:00:29.210> point<00:00:29.450> so<00:00:30.079> that<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.380> Rue<00:00:30.590> will

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
a boiling point so that the Rue will

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.430 
a boiling point so that the Rue will
thicken<00:00:31.160> your<00:00:31.340> sauce<00:00:31.759> if<00:00:32.119> you<00:00:32.239> don't<00:00:32.509> it'll

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
taste a lot like just like a flowery

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.350 
taste a lot like just like a flowery
taste<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.380> it<00:00:37.310> won't<00:00:37.490> taste<00:00:37.670> good<00:00:37.910> at<00:00:38.030> all<00:00:38.120> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
it won't thicken like it should so you

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.120 
it won't thicken like it should so you
have<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.880> make<00:00:41.030> sure<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.420> your<00:00:42.260> milk<00:00:42.590> is<00:00:42.860> if
