00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.520
 hi how about this we are in a new 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
 video from our neighbors like Sara 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.689
 gold camouflage sector and as with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 centuries as it is made of diamonds for the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.919
 gold camouflage let's create a class 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 and good of all the challenges let's say 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.750
 that all messages are equal 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.849
 all the weapons I gave him to select 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.430
 to see the camouflages of the knife 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 ok if you give the triangle over 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.680
 primary weapon or the secondary one is where 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.090
 the anchors that you carry is worth as I already 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 I have everyone in the knife I'm going 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.739
 It is easier on the face itself 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.739
 OK 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.490
 of all the waves as classes until 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.580
 you arrive to arrive has been written 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.440
 Tyson consists of putting 200 shots 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.720
 to the head or 100 shots to the head or 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.640
 300 casualties are worth those standard 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.500
 is simply going to shoot at the head 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 of the game made a few games to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760
 the head and according to the number that I tell you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 you already see those are the weapons and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 the normal head or low is already 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.800
 to get out of here all normal 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.510
 then the pleased carbon fiber 10 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.090
 injured by the back valeria this 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.550
 stabbed shoot the suffering 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.040
 five surviving medals which 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.620
 it means if you have to kill a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.150
 enemy that first you have hurt and 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.550
 say when the workshop is for the workshop 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 hurt you kill him this is already with 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.470
 of the art 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 of the war of 5 mental media and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 revenge is to kill the one who has 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.010
 killed in 25 times this is in the case 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.350
 of the knife to the best in regret are 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.350
 10 times I do not know the roll 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 his gun and his gun you'd better 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.270
 would you make a crack depends on mercy 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.820
 to 15 or 10 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.670
 then the skull 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.430
 bloodthirsty is the most difficult of all 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.409
 homemade stripes of 5 say a medal 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 extraordinary is a 5 kill streak 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.920
 making people fights without dying 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.770
 in the case of the knife of 5 but the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.590
 incarnation with backs 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.870
 ten years night then and at the time you 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.879
 They give when they have reached the skulls 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.810
 here you do not see the diamond camouflage 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.310
 because now I'm just going to explain all 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 the medals that all the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.439
 Camouflage challenges are worth this then 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.849
 the challenges in the position are equal 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.920
 asks kill your sword in the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.890
 gold they give it to you already you have all and for 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.550
 get the diamond is hidden what 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.550

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.750
 golden rifles of diamonds 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.110

 when you have all folders 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.180
 of gold the light rules equal rifles 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.620
 of precision that castrated the francs of 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.170
