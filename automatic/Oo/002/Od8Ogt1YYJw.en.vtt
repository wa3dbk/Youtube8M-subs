00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.830
 hello my logs guardians how are you 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.840
 welcome to a new destiny video 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.269
 and today I will explain a strategy 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.160
 to finish with schools you already know the 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.520
 leader of the fallen wolves that is going to 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.769
 wait patiently at level 35 of the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.840
 prison of the elderly good as you see 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.449
 I am very well accompanied by two of the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.279
 best dancers in the world 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.689
 and luckily for me apart from good 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.369
 dancers are also very good 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.890
 wrestlers good first thing that 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.379
 you need is that your team 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.239
 compose by two titans and a hunter 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.790
 we need the titans to wear 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.440
 put the subclass of defense you know 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.540
 the one that creates the bubble and that bubble 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.070
 it has to be with the advantage of weapons of 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.260
 light so that once we are inside 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.659
 of the bubble, let's do more damage 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.210
 with all our weapons good said 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.680
 this the hunter is important because he 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.600
 will take charge of deactivating the mines 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.640
 that are going to appear during this 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.559
 final battle with schools well well what 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.939
 first thing we do is go out in the area 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.559
 on the left we go down this corridor 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.260
 and when we get to the area of 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.030
 servant because we destroyed it we finished 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.070
 quickly with him so that schools do not 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.870
 have that shield provided by the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.490
 good servant once you 're 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.460
 before schools as you see one of the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.380
 titans will create is going to unfold that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.970
 bubble as I said with light weapons and 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.400
 automatically then let's start 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.590
 shoot all three together with a good 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.170
 sniper rifle a good rifle 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.840
 sniper that includes the element of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.550
 damage that week we need in 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.370
 concrete well now we are using 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.290
 vacuum guns let's shoot like you 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.670
 I say the three with the snipers to the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.710
 head of schools like this we do 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.350
 quite hurt and once we finish with 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.850
 the ammunition of the sniper rifle always 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.470
 we can move quickly to our 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.870
 heavy that will also include then that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.910
 elemental damage that we require good a 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.580
 once the sound of the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.530
 sirens that tells us that the mines already 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.500
 they are activated because we take our 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.390
 hunter with the subclass of the acrobat of 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.430
 edge and we do it like that because 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.870
 we will need to become invisible and 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.180
 use the knives as you have seen 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.250
 in the images to get there quickly 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.990
 at one of the mines the mines appear from 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.160
 random way is very easy because 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 this one that I'm deactivating right now 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 may that always appear as you see 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.130
 on the other side, that's why I tell you that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.780
 we need some agility with the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.319
 hunter and also the invisibility we 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 will carry 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.489
 help a lot so that the enemies do not 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.799
 shoot us and let us deactivate the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.040
 mine very comfortably good as you see 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.659
 here I could not activate invisibility 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
 because they kept firing me not me 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.319
 just got it then put in a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.920
 point that would have been comfortable but good 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.689
 As you can see, I was able to finish 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.819
 disarm the mine and my colleagues then 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.400
 they stayed here ending with schools 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.650
 as I tell you it's a team work there 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.719
 than doing it in a very 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.819
 synchronized the mines although you finish 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.099
 with schools you have to deactivate the os 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.870
 notice this because one has already gone through 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.060
 that experience so even if you finish 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.459
 with schools and quickly to deactivate 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.340
 if there is any activated mine because if 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.750
 will not give us the round by completed as well 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.540
 how good this would be the strategy as 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.250
 you see is a very simple thing to explain 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.699
 it takes very little time but until 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.079
 you take the exact point and you have that 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.639
 necessary coordination to end 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.980
 He then surely that you have to 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.870
 go through a few rounds of failures 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.120
 so nothing good this is the video that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 I wanted to share with you I hope that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440
 it will be useful if you use any 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 another strategy or if 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.710
 good you want to leave some kind of 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.210
 recommendation in the comments 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.700
 I invite you to make it welcome 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.340
 you are I am gothic and see you in the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.580
 next video that goes very well take care 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 much 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.150
 goodbye
