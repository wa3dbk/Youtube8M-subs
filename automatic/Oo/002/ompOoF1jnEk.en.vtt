ring<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.990> here<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.820> off<00:02:11.940> something

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
ring on here now that's off something

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.690 
ring on here now that's off something
else<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:13.100> put<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:14.520> because<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:16.700> bolt

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
else I put that on here because the bolt

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.740 
else I put that on here because the bolt
that<00:02:18.060> comes<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:20.790> doesn't<00:02:21.060> stay<00:02:21.510> in

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that comes with this it doesn't stay in

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.410 
that comes with this it doesn't stay in
in<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.650> tripod<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.250> even<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> legs<00:02:24.270> are

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
in the tripod so even if the legs are

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.600 
in the tripod so even if the legs are
closed<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:25.380> has<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.860> potential<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> fall

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
closed this has the potential to fall

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.050 
closed this has the potential to fall
out<00:02:26.820> right<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:30.500> well<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.680> almost<00:02:31.830> out

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.590 

yeah<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.510> kind<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.310> issue

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
yeah it's a kind of a kind of an issue

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.520 
yeah it's a kind of a kind of an issue
when<00:02:39.600> especially<00:02:40.050> when<00:02:40.170> you're<00:02:40.260> trying<00:02:40.380> to

when especially when you're trying to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.230 
when especially when you're trying to
just<00:02:40.890> even<00:02:41.160> trying<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> put<00:02:41.610> stuff<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.060> here

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
just even trying to put stuff on here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.690 
just even trying to put stuff on here
you<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.709> hold<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.010> from<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.310> bottom<00:02:44.610> as

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
you have to hold it from the bottom as

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.190 
you have to hold it from the bottom as
well<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.820> basically<00:02:47.820> yeah<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
well and basically yeah if you if you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.160 
well and basically yeah if you if you
don't<00:02:50.120> after<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.240> use<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.810> need<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.020> put

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
don't after you use it you need to put

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.790 
don't after you use it you need to put
the<00:02:52.950> came<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.780> adapter<00:02:54.990> so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800

the came with this little adapter so
after<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> use<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.420> after<00:02:58.080> every<00:02:58.260> time<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
after you use this after every time you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
after you use this after every time you
take<00:02:58.709> something<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.220> an<00:02:59.340> offer<00:02:59.490> you<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
take something on an offer you have to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.970 
take something on an offer you have to
put<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.840> adapter<00:03:01.260> back<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
put this adapter back on so that the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.670 
put this adapter back on so that the
screw<00:03:02.190> doesn't<00:03:02.370> fall<00:03:02.550> out<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:04.170> very

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
screw doesn't fall out that's very

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.060 
screw doesn't fall out that's very
annoying<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.340> very<00:03:05.790> badly<00:03:06.060> made<00:03:06.740> it's<00:03:07.740> kind

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
annoying and very badly made it's kind

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.270 
annoying and very badly made it's kind
of<00:03:08.240> really<00:03:09.240> dumb<00:03:09.990> engineering<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:11.400> dumb

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
of really dumb engineering or dumb

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.080 
of really dumb engineering or dumb
manufacturing<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.500> suppose<00:03:16.769> fine<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
manufacturing but I suppose fine for the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.380 
manufacturing but I suppose fine for the
price<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.440> almost<00:03:19.650> worth<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.220> not<00:03:21.180> really

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
price it's almost worth it not really

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.970 
price it's almost worth it not really
but<00:03:22.050> kind<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:23.959> for<00:03:24.959> because<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:25.860> much

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
but kind of for because it's so much

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.120 
but kind of for because it's so much
cheaper<00:03:26.010> than<00:03:27.350> actual<00:03:28.350> gorilla<00:03:28.680> pods

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
cheaper than actual gorilla pods

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.020 
cheaper than actual gorilla pods
I<00:03:29.540> found<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.810> could<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.380> useful<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:32.100> lights

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
I found this could be useful for lights

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.810 
I found this could be useful for lights
if<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.019> got<00:03:34.200> lights<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> one<00:03:35.459> behind<00:03:35.580> me

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
if you got lights like the one behind me

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.720 
if you got lights like the one behind me
is<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.390> these<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.930> spare<00:03:37.260> one

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
is on one of these the spare one

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.380 
is on one of these the spare one
actually<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.910> know<00:03:38.970> which<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.269> these

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
actually don't know which one of these

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.380 
actually don't know which one of these
was<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.630> second<00:03:40.080> one<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:41.060> yeah<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.269> know

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
was the second one but yeah you know

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.940 
was the second one but yeah you know
kind<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.840> could<00:03:43.110> be<00:03:43.140> good<00:03:43.320> for<00:03:43.470> lights<00:03:43.680> could

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
kind of could be good for lights could

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.570 
kind of could be good for lights could
be<00:03:44.010> good<00:03:44.280> for<00:03:44.580> microphone<00:03:46.040> could<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.130> good<00:03:47.310> for

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
be good for microphone could be good for

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.130 
be good for microphone could be good for
I<00:03:48.060> don't<00:03:48.450> know<00:03:49.519> anyways<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:51.390> was<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.780> review

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
I don't know anyways that was the review

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.650 
I don't know anyways that was the review
on<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.390> conclude<00:03:56.180> if<00:03:57.180> it's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
on this I think to conclude if it's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.060 
on this I think to conclude if it's
worth<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.049> for<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.290> if<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.739> want

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
worth it for you if so if you want

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.699 
worth it for you if so if you want
something<00:03:59.280> that's<00:03:59.459> very<00:03:59.640> weak<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.410> will

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
something that's very weak and that will

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.910 
something that's very weak and that will
work<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.549> hold<00:04:03.000> your<00:04:03.150> camera<00:04:03.360> but<00:04:03.750> if<00:04:04.019> you

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
work really hold your camera but if you

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.550 
work really hold your camera but if you
put<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.220> camera<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.820> like<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.350> legs

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
put the camera on it like if the legs

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560 
put the camera on it like if the legs
are<00:04:07.739> straight<00:04:08.070> like<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.360> put<00:04:09.540> a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
are straight like that and you put a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.199 
are straight like that and you put a
DSLR<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:11.610> will<00:04:11.820> hold<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.120> weight

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
DSLR on it it will hold the weight

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.810 
DSLR on it it will hold the weight
downwards<00:04:13.019> kind<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:14.190> can't<00:04:14.430> press<00:04:14.549> down

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
downwards kind of you can't press down

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.520 
downwards kind of you can't press down
on<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.000> or<00:04:15.180> will<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.140> legs<00:04:16.320> will<00:04:16.500> just

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
on it or will one of the legs will just

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.800 
on it or will one of the legs will just
sort<00:04:16.770> of<00:04:16.830> Bend<00:04:17.070> but<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.940> will<00:04:18.090> hold<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.660> weight

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
sort of Bend but it will hold the weight

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.890 
sort of Bend but it will hold the weight
like<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.650> know<00:04:19.789> you<00:04:20.789> put<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.120> that

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
like that you know you put it like that

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.159 
like that you know you put it like that
just<00:04:22.079> put<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.259> camera<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.800> will<00:04:22.919> hold

mounted to stuff mounted to some like

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.850 
mounted to stuff mounted to some like
like<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> rails<00:05:12.570> inside<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:13.110> stairs<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.530> think

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
like the rails inside of stairs I think

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.969 
like the rails inside of stairs I think
and<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:16.260> don't<00:05:17.070> member<00:05:17.340> what<00:05:17.460> else<00:05:18.260> but<00:05:19.260> there

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
and I don't member what else but there

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.320 
and I don't member what else but there
was<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.099> photo<00:05:20.400> where<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.729> was<00:05:20.820> just<00:05:20.849> standing

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
was a photo where it was just standing

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.010 
was a photo where it was just standing
on<00:05:21.449> it<00:05:21.539> like<00:05:21.630> that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
on it like that

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.499 
on it like that
and<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.800> basically<00:05:23.009> they're<00:05:23.820> not<00:05:23.970> selling<00:05:24.330> you

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
and so basically they're not selling you

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.120 
and so basically they're not selling you
what<00:05:25.349> actually<00:05:25.740> was<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.729> listing<00:05:28.130> what's

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
what actually was in the listing what's

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.339 
what actually was in the listing what's
in<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.370> images<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:29.940> what<00:05:30.120> it's<00:05:30.539> almost<00:05:30.870> as

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
in the images and what it's almost as

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.920 
in the images and what it's almost as
long<00:05:31.889> as<00:05:32.070> they<00:05:32.220> say<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.780> but<00:05:33.780> it's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
long as they say it is but it's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.610 
long as they say it is but it's
definitely<00:05:34.229> smaller<00:05:34.770> than<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> photos<00:05:35.389> so

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
definitely smaller than the photos so

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.430 
definitely smaller than the photos so
