and such but what many people don't know
and<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.369> figured<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and I just figured this out are you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.520 
and I just figured this out are you
earlier<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.790> let's<00:01:41.790> say<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> wanted<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.110> jump

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
earlier that let's say I wanted to jump

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
earlier that let's say I wanted to jump
over<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.430> rock<00:01:44.670> over<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.450> had<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.659> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
over this rock over here all I had to do

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
over this rock over here all I had to do
let's<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.070> next<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.610> keep

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
let's get up next to it and just keep

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
let's get up next to it and just keep
pressing<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> can't<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.350> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
pressing it but I can't because it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
pressing it but I can't because it's
curled<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> figure<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.810> out<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
curled so what I figure it out is that

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.910 
curled so what I figure it out is that
you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.860> climb<00:01:56.070> trees<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:57.920> just

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you can climb trees in this good just

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
you can climb trees in this good just
let<00:01:59.100> me<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.490> can't<00:01:59.670> find<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.149> tree

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
let me do it we can't find a good tree

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
let me do it we can't find a good tree

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
um like pushing yourself up against the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.270 
um like pushing yourself up against the
tree<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.770> can<00:03:39.950> climb<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.490> tree<00:03:41.980> as<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.160> can

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
tree you can climb the tree as you can

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.150 
tree you can climb the tree as you can
see<00:03:43.490> I<00:03:43.520> keep<00:03:43.760> going<00:03:43.910> off<00:03:44.210> and<00:03:44.480> open<00:03:45.050> up<00:03:45.520> up<00:03:46.520> up

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
I don't know exactly how high I can go

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.720 
I don't know exactly how high I can go

but once you get a higher to the top and
then<00:03:56.330> I'm<00:03:56.420> on<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.660> top<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.050> tree<00:03:59.410> as<00:04:00.410> you

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
then I'm on the top of the tree as you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.340 
then I'm on the top of the tree as you
can<00:04:00.980> see<00:04:01.750> actually<00:04:02.750> take<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.140> couple
