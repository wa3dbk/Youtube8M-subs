00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
think there's there's a fairly big

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.149 
think there's there's a fairly big
market<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:30.330> mean<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:31.409> are<00:04:31.500> going<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.800> launch<00:04:31.979> the

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
market I mean we are going to launch the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.279 
market I mean we are going to launch the
device<00:04:32.400> in<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.729> beginning<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.090> April<00:04:33.449> we<00:04:34.139> are

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
device in the beginning of April we are

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.070 
device in the beginning of April we are
launching<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.919> with<00:04:35.099> two<00:04:35.669> big<00:04:36.389> network

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
launching it with two big network

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.480 
launching it with two big network
operators<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:37.949> of<00:04:38.070> course<00:04:38.099> it<00:04:38.430> will

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
operators and then of course it will

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.120 
operators and then of course it will
extend<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.389> range<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:40.440> other<00:04:40.560> customers<00:04:40.740> as

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
extend the range to other customers as

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.300 
extend the range to other customers as
well<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.909> there's<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.599> big<00:04:43.590> potential<00:04:44.130> for

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
well I think there's a big potential for

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.700 
well I think there's a big potential for
the<00:04:44.370> form<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.870> we<00:04:45.870> will<00:04:45.900> see<00:04:46.289> then<00:04:46.530> we<00:04:46.650> are

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
the form and we will see then we are

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.379 
the form and we will see then we are
going<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:47.010> launch<00:04:47.190> nor<00:04:47.490> with<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.669> big<00:04:47.909> marketing

think it will have a huge impact i think

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.450 
think it will have a huge impact i think
really<00:04:58.289> we<00:04:58.560> will

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
really we will

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.400 
really we will
what<00:05:01.460> do<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.580> think<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.750> market<00:05:03.110> doing<00:05:03.140> in

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
what do you think is the market doing in

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.990 
what do you think is the market doing in
terms<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.740> screen<00:05:04.040> sizes<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.550> flagship

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
terms of screen sizes the flagship

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.850 
terms of screen sizes the flagship
devices<00:05:05.330> with<00:05:05.690> every<00:05:05.930> generation<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.620> screen

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
devices with every generation the screen

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740 
devices with every generation the screen
has<00:05:06.950> become<00:05:07.220> bigger<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.520> bigger<00:05:07.850> why<00:05:08.450> is<00:05:08.510> that

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
has become bigger and bigger why is that

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.640 
has become bigger and bigger why is that
and<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.650> see<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.250> trend<00:05:10.430> continuing<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.650> I

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
and you see that trend continuing I I

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.350 
and you see that trend continuing I I
think<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.310> what<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.790> can<00:05:14.030> see<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.210> the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
think that what you can see in the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.020 
think that what you can see in the
market<00:05:14.600> is<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.110> vendors<00:05:16.010> are<00:05:16.220> switching

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
market is that the vendors are switching

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.970 
market is that the vendors are switching
between<00:05:17.150> different<00:05:17.750> screen<00:05:18.050> sizes<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.620> think

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
between different screen sizes I think

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.790 
between different screen sizes I think
the<00:05:19.220> trend<00:05:19.430> will<00:05:19.730> will<00:05:20.060> will<00:05:20.360> go<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.410> think

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
the trend will will will go on I think

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.910 
the trend will will will go on I think
the<00:05:22.010> screen<00:05:22.310> sizes<00:05:22.580> will<00:05:22.910> increase<00:05:23.720> but<00:05:24.590> on

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
the screen sizes will increase but on

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.710 
the screen sizes will increase but on
the<00:05:25.070> other<00:05:25.130> hand<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.520> mean<00:05:25.670> you<00:05:25.820> still<00:05:26.090> will<00:05:26.450> see

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
the other hand I mean you still will see

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.080 
the other hand I mean you still will see
answers<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.830> have<00:05:27.860> smaller<00:05:28.340> screen<00:05:28.640> size<00:05:28.670> so

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
answers that have smaller screen size so

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.570 
answers that have smaller screen size so
there's<00:05:29.300> no<00:05:29.650> let's<00:05:30.650> say<00:05:30.860> there<00:05:31.040> is<00:05:31.130> no<00:05:31.160> no

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
there's no let's say there is no no

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.790 
there's no let's say there is no no
optimum<00:05:32.240> or<00:05:32.450> best<00:05:32.810> screen<00:05:33.110> size<00:05:33.410> in<00:05:33.650> that

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
optimum or best screen size in that

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.590 
optimum or best screen size in that
sense<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:34.340> still<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:34.850> will<00:05:35.090> have<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> full

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
sense so still you will have a full

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.720 
sense so still you will have a full
range<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:36.110> full<00:05:36.320> portfolio<00:05:36.680> of<00:05:37.070> different

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
range of full portfolio of different

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.430 
range of full portfolio of different
handsets<00:05:38.030> with<00:05:38.360> different<00:05:38.660> screen<00:05:38.900> sizes<00:05:38.930> I

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
handsets with different screen sizes I

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.220 
handsets with different screen sizes I
think<00:05:39.950> there's<00:05:40.160> no<00:05:40.370> one<00:05:40.640> single<00:05:40.970> magic<00:05:41.960> screen

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
think there's no one single magic screen

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.920 
think there's no one single magic screen
size<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.770> fits<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.160> all<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.780> what<00:05:44.780> did<00:05:44.870> you

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
size that fits it all and what did you

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.470 
size that fits it all and what did you
see<00:05:45.290> in<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:46.010> market<00:05:46.370> research<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:46.910> is<00:05:47.030> that

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
see in the market research that is that

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.120 
see in the market research that is that
that<00:05:47.630> you<00:05:47.900> decided<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:48.680> need<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.860> very

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
that you decided that you need a very

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.040 
that you decided that you need a very
very<00:05:49.370> durable<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:50.060> waterproof<00:05:50.630> device

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
very durable and waterproof device

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.330 
very durable and waterproof device
because<00:05:51.350> it's<00:05:51.500> one<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.830> first<00:05:52.130> in<00:05:52.310> the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
because it's one of the first in the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.300 
because it's one of the first in the
world<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.850> think<00:05:53.660> that<00:05:53.720> with<00:05:54.440> durable<00:05:55.160> and

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
world I think that with durable and

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.040 
world I think that with durable and
water-resistant<00:05:56.000> phones<00:05:56.240> i<00:05:56.450> mean<00:05:56.600> it's<00:05:56.780> it's

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
water-resistant phones i mean it's it's

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.900 
water-resistant phones i mean it's it's
nothing<00:05:57.410> new<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.740> sonic<00:05:58.130> because<00:05:58.430> i<00:05:58.610> mean<00:05:58.790> in

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
nothing new to sonic because i mean in

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.870 
nothing new to sonic because i mean in
japan<00:05:59.300> almost<00:06:00.170> all<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:00.740> handsets<00:06:01.220> brought<00:06:01.730> to

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
japan almost all the handsets brought to

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.730 
japan almost all the handsets brought to
the<00:06:02.000> market<00:06:02.030> by<00:06:02.420> sony<00:06:02.660> are<00:06:02.900> water-resistant

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
the market by sony are water-resistant

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700 
the market by sony are water-resistant
and<00:06:03.860> then<00:06:04.100> dustproof<00:06:05.030> so<00:06:05.720> from<00:06:06.230> that<00:06:06.260> sense

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
and then dustproof so from that sense

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.740 
and then dustproof so from that sense
the<00:06:06.890> technology<00:06:07.490> is<00:06:07.550> there<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:08.270> only<00:06:08.540> thing

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
the technology is there the only thing

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.390 
the technology is there the only thing
that's<00:06:08.960> only<00:06:09.170> did<00:06:09.350> basically<00:06:09.560> was<00:06:09.980> to<00:06:10.190> really

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
that's only did basically was to really

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.880 
that's only did basically was to really
take<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.510> best<00:06:11.690> of<00:06:11.900> Sony<00:06:12.170> and<00:06:12.440> put<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:12.770> into

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
take the best of Sony and put it into

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.830 
take the best of Sony and put it into
one<00:06:13.250> smartphone<00:06:13.640> and<00:06:14.000> roll<00:06:14.210> it<00:06:14.330> out<00:06:14.480> of<00:06:14.720> the

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
one smartphone and roll it out of the

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.900 
one smartphone and roll it out of the
rest<00:06:14.990> of<00:06:15.170> the<00:06:15.260> world<00:06:15.500> so<00:06:15.770> from<00:06:16.280> that<00:06:16.310> point<00:06:16.700> of

rest of the world so from that point of

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.490 
rest of the world so from that point of
view<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.390> mean<00:06:17.540> it's<00:06:17.720> a<00:06:17.810> technology<00:06:18.080> that<00:06:18.260> was

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
view I mean it's a technology that was

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.760 
view I mean it's a technology that was
existing<00:06:19.040> on<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.820> other<00:06:19.940> hand<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.420> mean<00:06:20.770> water

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
make sure that it's really really

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.230 
make sure that it's really really
working<00:07:16.289> and<00:07:16.469> that<00:07:16.590> we<00:07:16.770> don't<00:07:16.919> let's<00:07:17.250> that<00:07:18.120> we

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.330 
huh if you're rolling out some kind of
software<00:07:24.479> update<00:07:24.960> and<00:07:25.229> the<00:07:25.860> phone<00:07:26.069> gets

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
software update and the phone gets

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.159 
software update and the phone gets
slower<00:07:26.639> and<00:07:26.879> slower<00:07:27.060> and<00:07:27.389> slower<00:07:27.539> that<00:07:27.990> we
