the leaves are still firm so I was
worried<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.950> might<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.939> them

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
worried that it might actually get them

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
worried that it might actually get them
but<00:01:24.689> nope<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> leaves<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
but nope the leaves are still really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.649

firm<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.720> great<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.939> since<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> was

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
firm so it's great so so since that was

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
firm so it's great so so since that was
a<00:01:30.689> stick<00:01:31.110> fell<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> decided<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.070> wanted<00:01:32.400> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
how to take care of them so it went

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.670 
how to take care of them so it went
through<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> period<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.349> being<00:02:22.349> sick<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.099> I

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
through a period of being sick so I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.080 
through a period of being sick so I
thought<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.709> would<00:02:25.980> actually<00:02:26.430> lose<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.849> spell

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
thought I would actually lose the spell

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.110 
thought I would actually lose the spell
at<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> point<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.290> time<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.640> it's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
at a point in time but it it's here it's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.759 
at a point in time but it it's here it's
still<00:02:30.330> alive<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.170> was<00:02:31.230> actually<00:02:31.410> pretty

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
still alive and I was actually pretty

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.930 
still alive and I was actually pretty
healthy<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
healthy so here it is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.720 
healthy so here it is
so<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.930> an<00:02:37.140> hydroton<00:02:37.590> clay<00:02:38.040> medium<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:40.730> as

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
so it was an hydroton clay medium and as

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.119 
so it was an hydroton clay medium and as
you<00:02:41.879> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.239> there's<00:02:42.510> still<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> few<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
you can see there's still a few and

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.100 
you can see there's still a few and
these<00:02:44.430> aren't<00:02:44.760> long<00:02:45.300> roots<00:02:45.660> oh<00:02:45.840> no<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.050> looks

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
these aren't long roots oh no it looks

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.199 
these aren't long roots oh no it looks
great<00:02:46.500> picky<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.280> they're<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.580> brown<00:02:47.910> roots

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
great picky but they're just brown roots

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.949 
great picky but they're just brown roots
so<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.410> there's<00:02:49.620> still<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.830> couple

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.720 

so<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> couple<00:02:55.290> clay<00:02:55.709> pellets<00:02:55.950> there's<00:02:56.370> stuck

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
so a couple clay pellets there's stuck

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.250 
so a couple clay pellets there's stuck
to<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.000> roots<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.569> didn't<00:02:57.840> want<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.050> remove

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
to the roots so I didn't want to remove

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.860 
to the roots so I didn't want to remove
those<00:02:58.560> because<00:02:59.099> it<00:03:00.060> was<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.510> really

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
those because it was it's really

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.339 
those because it was it's really
actually<00:03:01.019> stuck<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.030> roof<00:03:03.209> itself<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.930> if

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
actually stuck to the roof itself and if

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.080 
actually stuck to the roof itself and if
I<00:03:04.739> did<00:03:04.950> pull<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.550> it's<00:03:05.790> still<00:03:05.940> gonna

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
I did pull it out it's still gonna

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:14.149 
I did pull it out it's still gonna
damage<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.780> roots<00:03:08.030> okay<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:11.040> yeah<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> that's

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
damage the roots okay so yeah so that's

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.300 
damage the roots okay so yeah so that's
really<00:03:14.340> exciting<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:15.890> again<00:03:16.890> I'm<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.220> do

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
really exciting so again I'm going to do

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.860 
really exciting so again I'm going to do
the<00:03:17.400> same<00:03:17.640> method<00:03:19.069> on<00:03:20.069> two<00:03:20.760> days<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.209> water<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
the same method on two days in water and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.020 
the same method on two days in water and
then<00:03:22.709> five<00:03:22.980> days<00:03:23.310> yeah<00:03:23.849> root<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.549> two<00:03:26.790> days

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
then five days yeah root so the two days

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.949 
then five days yeah root so the two days
will<00:03:27.420> give<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.250> moisture<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:30.659> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
will give it the moisture and the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.920 
will give it the moisture and the
nutrients<00:03:31.590> from<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.920> fertilizer<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:33.360> then

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
nutrients from the fertilizer and then

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.869 
nutrients from the fertilizer and then
the<00:03:34.170> five<00:03:34.379> days<00:03:34.620> will<00:03:34.920> allow<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.340> roots<00:03:35.700> to

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
the five days will allow the roots to

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.649 
the five days will allow the roots to
dry<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.930> again<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.670> short<00:03:39.150> proof

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
dry so again this is not a short proof

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.559 
dry so again this is not a short proof
method<00:03:40.670> again<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.790> said<00:03:42.000> mentioned<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.330> my<00:03:42.420> last

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
method again I said mentioned in my last

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.820 
method again I said mentioned in my last
video<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.290> saw<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:44.819> Instagram<00:03:45.830> post

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
video I saw this on an Instagram post

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.119 
video I saw this on an Instagram post
and<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.849> asked<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:51.269> user<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:52.860> know<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.040> it

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
and I asked the user you know if it

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.679 
and I asked the user you know if it
worked<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.400> him<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.849> he<00:03:54.000> said<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.420> didn't

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
worked for him and he said that didn't

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.210 
worked for him and he said that didn't
he<00:03:54.780> was<00:03:54.959> working<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:55.379> well<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.650> even<00:03:55.950> put

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
he was working really well and even put

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.630 
he was working really well and even put
out<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> flower<00:03:56.580> spike<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:59.069> this<00:03:59.189> is<00:03:59.250> great

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
out a flower spike so but this is great

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.149 
out a flower spike so but this is great
you<00:03:59.760> basically<00:04:00.180> said<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.439> forget<00:04:01.739> it

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
you basically said it and forget it

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.119 
you basically said it and forget it
so<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.629> not<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.470> know<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:05.010> not

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
so I like it it's not you know it's not

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.259 
so I like it it's not you know it's not
high<00:04:05.340> maintenance<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.760> don't<00:04:05.819> have<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.150> you

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
high maintenance you don't have to you

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.479 
high maintenance you don't have to you
missed<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.900> check<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.349> every<00:04:07.500> day<00:04:07.860> it's

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
missed it and check on it every day it's

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.460 
missed it and check on it every day it's
basically<00:04:09.030> leaving<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.930> water<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.230> two

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
basically leaving it in water for two

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.250 
basically leaving it in water for two
days<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.010> then<00:04:11.250> letting<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.610> try<00:04:11.909> out<00:04:12.260> in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
days and then letting it try out in

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.770 
days and then letting it try out in
their<00:04:13.560> root<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:14.010> five<00:04:14.159> days<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.239> that's

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
their root for five days so that's

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.060 
their root for five days so that's
um<00:04:18.090> almost<00:04:19.090> seems<00:04:19.450> like<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.630> fail<00:04:20.440> proof<00:04:20.680> method

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
um almost seems like a fail proof method

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.280 
um almost seems like a fail proof method
but<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.430> never<00:04:21.579> know<00:04:21.790> again<00:04:22.389> this<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.110> not

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
but you never know again this is not

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.040 
but you never know again this is not
definite<00:04:23.889> this<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:24.310> experimenting<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.330> will

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
definite this is experimenting I will

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.050
