00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
Arkaden and I think I'm pretty low level

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.510 
Arkaden and I think I'm pretty low level
I<00:00:15.839> think<00:00:15.870> I'm<00:00:16.080> around<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.440> level<00:00:16.800> 10<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.100> 11<00:00:17.430> or

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I think I'm around at level 10 or 11 or

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.519 
I think I'm around at level 10 or 11 or
so<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.940> today<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.019> just<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.380> going

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
so and today I'm just going to be going

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
so and today I'm just going to be going
over<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.859> little<00:00:20.070> bit<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> start<00:00:21.600> off

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
over a little bit on how to start off

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.939 
over a little bit on how to start off
doing<00:00:22.080> well<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.439> modern<00:00:22.680> warfare<00:00:22.710> 3<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
doing well in modern warfare 3 so the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
doing well in modern warfare 3 so the
beginning<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.400> match<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:27.150> start

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
beginning of this match I don't start

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.939 
beginning of this match I don't start
off<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.779> too<00:00:27.960> well<00:00:27.990> mostly<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
off doing too well mostly because I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.609 
off doing too well mostly because I
don't<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
don't know really where I'm going so I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
don't know really where I'm going so I
get<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> couple<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.220> deaths<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.900> figure<00:00:33.900> out

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
get a couple of deaths but I figure out

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
get a couple of deaths but I figure out
it<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.650> is<00:00:34.830> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> pretty<00:00:35.430> hot

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it that this is going to be a pretty hot

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
it that this is going to be a pretty hot
spot<00:00:35.940> over<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.210> top<00:00:36.420> corner<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.469> that's

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
spot over this top corner here so that's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
spot over this top corner here so that's
really<00:00:37.710> where<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> try<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
really where I want to be so I try and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
really where I want to be so I try and
make<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.780> way<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:39.960> each<00:00:40.320> time<00:00:40.550> eventually<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
make my way there each time eventually I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
make my way there each time eventually I
get<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.600> doing<00:00:42.809> pretty<00:00:42.960> good

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
get there and I start doing pretty good

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.150 
get there and I start doing pretty good

red dots when they pop up because that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
red dots when they pop up because that
