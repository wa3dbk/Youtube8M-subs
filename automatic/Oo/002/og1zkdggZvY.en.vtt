be by far the best and fastest way to

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.920 
be by far the best and fastest way to

get most of them crazy orders can of

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.480 
get most of them crazy orders can of
course<00:01:11.140> be<00:01:11.320> pretty<00:01:11.530> unpredictable<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:12.430> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
course be pretty unpredictable and it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.370 
course be pretty unpredictable and it
can<00:01:12.640> be<00:01:12.759> difficult<00:01:13.180> but<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.659> there<00:01:13.990> are<00:01:14.110> ways<00:01:14.350> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
can be difficult but I there are ways to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.020 
can be difficult but I there are ways to
kind<00:01:14.799> of<00:01:14.860> take<00:01:15.130> advantage<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:15.820> gain

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
kind of take advantage of it and gain

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.940 
kind of take advantage of it and gain
the<00:01:16.180> system<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.720> personally<00:01:17.470> use<00:01:17.710> some

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
the system I personally use some

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.340 
the system I personally use some
equipment<00:01:18.460> some<00:01:19.210> custom<00:01:19.509> equipment<00:01:19.689> that<00:01:20.049> let

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
equipment some custom equipment that let

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.219 
equipment some custom equipment that let
me<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.909> each<00:01:22.060> battle<00:01:22.330> with<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.570> homerun<00:01:22.960> bat

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
me start each battle with a homerun bat

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.340 
me start each battle with a homerun bat
and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.610> also<00:01:24.970> swing<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.539> homerun<00:01:25.840> bat<00:01:26.110> at

and then also swing the homerun bat at

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.230 
and then also swing the homerun bat at
like<00:01:26.649> twice<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.369> speed<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:27.970> can<00:01:28.119> get

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
like twice the speed so you can get

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.719 
like twice the speed so you can get
really<00:01:28.420> quick<00:01:28.840> instant<00:01:29.470> death<00:01:29.860> forged

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
really quick instant death forged

really quick instant death forged
smashes<00:01:31.149> out<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.659> most<00:01:32.440> mostly<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.069> AI

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
smashes out of it and most mostly the AI

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.529 
smashes out of it and most mostly the AI

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
everything really easy at least up to

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.699 
everything really easy at least up to
maybe<00:01:39.520> level<00:01:39.850> 20<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.959> battle<00:01:41.229> against<00:01:41.440> crazy

maybe level 20 the battle against crazy
hand<00:01:42.069> and<00:01:42.280> Master<00:01:42.580> Hand<00:01:42.729> can<00:01:42.909> be<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> little

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hand and Master Hand can be a little

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.289 
hand and Master Hand can be a little
difficult<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.220> level<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.030> don't

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
difficult at that level but you don't

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.419 
difficult at that level but you don't
have<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> necessarily<00:01:46.720> go<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.920> long<00:01:48.159> either

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
have to necessarily go that long either

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.340 
have to necessarily go that long either
you<00:01:49.149> know<00:01:49.240> by<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:49.509> you'll<00:01:49.720> most<00:01:49.959> likely<00:01:50.080> have

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
you know by then you'll most likely have

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.919 
you know by then you'll most likely have
already<00:01:50.940> banked<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.000> few<00:01:52.119> CDs<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.720> then<00:01:52.840> you

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
already banked a few CDs and then you

through the whole list just because

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.330 
through the whole list just because
there<00:02:17.319> are<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:17.500> many<00:02:17.530> songs<00:02:17.860> which<00:02:18.160> is

there are so many songs which is
definitely<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.180> bad<00:02:19.330> thing

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.200 

of<00:02:46.160> course<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.490> brought<00:02:46.670> back<00:02:46.700> most<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
of course they brought back most of the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.910 
of course they brought back most of the
music<00:02:47.390> from<00:02:47.630> brawl<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.200> melee<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:48.650> not

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
music from brawl and melee but not

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.560 
music from brawl and melee but not
really<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.280> much<00:02:49.460> from<00:02:49.580> 64<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.480> I'm

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
really that much from 64 so I'm

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.630 
really that much from 64 so I'm
wondering<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.080> reason<00:02:51.350> for<00:02:51.470> that

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
wondering if the reason for that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.100 
wondering if the reason for that
speculating<00:02:52.640> maybe<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:53.180> hopefully<00:02:53.960> that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
speculating maybe just hopefully that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.170 
speculating maybe just hopefully that
maybe<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.560> plan<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.430> bring<00:02:55.550> back<00:02:55.790> some<00:02:56.000> more

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
maybe they plan to bring back some more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.290 
maybe they plan to bring back some more
of<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.390> smash<00:02:56.720> 64<00:02:56.900> stages<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.680> DLC<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:59.030> course

of the smash 64 stages as DLC of course

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.630 
of the smash 64 stages as DLC of course
I<00:02:59.420> mean<00:02:59.570> there's<00:02:59.870> that's<00:03:00.680> far<00:03:01.040> from<00:03:01.160> confirmed

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
I mean there's that's far from confirmed

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.130 
I mean there's that's far from confirmed
but<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.210> would<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.330> pretty<00:03:02.450> cool<00:03:02.720> if<00:03:02.990> that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
but that would be pretty cool if that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:15.400 
but that would be pretty cool if that
was<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.380> case

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410

stage and brawl like modus Pizza it just
seemed<00:06:49.770> very<00:06:49.830> strange<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.669> there's<00:06:51.240> such<00:06:51.389> a

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
seemed very strange that there's such a

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.240 
seemed very strange that there's such a
limited<00:06:51.870> selection<00:06:52.020> of<00:06:52.380> music<00:06:52.680> on<00:06:52.800> gamer<00:06:53.070> and

limited selection of music on gamer and

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.219 
limited selection of music on gamer and
so<00:06:53.430> much<00:06:53.610> of<00:06:53.639> it<00:06:53.789> is<00:06:53.940> kind<00:06:54.210> of<00:06:54.300> forgettable

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
so much of it is kind of forgettable

although<00:07:00.360> I<00:07:00.389> guess<00:07:00.479> the<00:07:00.870> Ashley<00:07:01.620> song<00:07:01.830> is

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979

although I guess the Ashley song is
pretty<00:07:02.130> good
