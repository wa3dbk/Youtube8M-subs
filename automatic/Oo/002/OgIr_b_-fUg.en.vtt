00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.780
 we are here today inside the honda fit 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.360
 Wonderful cart and I'll tell you what 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.179
 quickly of a detail that much 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.000
 people miss and some do not even 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.289
 that really can be very 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 dangerous and it is exactly the absence of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.670
 motor temperature marker on the side 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 right that you will have the marker 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.660
 fuel in case it is automatic will 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 have at your side in the central a room 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 here on the left 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 engine turns and then what 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 detail the temperature marker of this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.610
 car is here on the left and the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 What is it going to be? 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.170
 it will be worth two leds a red 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.690
 it's a blue 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.750
 the blue will identify that the motor is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.799
 cold that it will probably only be 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 30 will be able to see you in the game 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.830
 car 30 minutes and 30 seconds it goes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 is off and another red is the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.470
 other ledio the red LED will indicate 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.810
 where the engine is above the temperature 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.350
 I believe the standard temperature of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 cigarette is 90 degrees somewhat surroundings and 90 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.040
 degrees 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.909
 so the temperature rises a little 95 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.680
 100 degrees 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.210
 the alert longer light up and you've already 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 will take a while and stop the vehicle 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.369
 check what's going on 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.590
 if it is simply lack of water the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 coolant in the radiator in the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 reservoir or if any other problem 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.750
 so it's important if you take it soon in a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.369
 mechanic for the workshop because problem 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.369
 heating is too dangerous 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.009
 and may cause overheating and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.869
 it will not be cool 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:04.490
 I will I will give the key here is the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.490
 extension with 102 luzhniki 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.300
 ok can see blue light and red light 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.890
 indicates that the engine is cold and the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.840
 indicates that the motor is 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.410
 working above ideal temperature 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.930
 in case it is not connected because I already 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.280
 I was running with the car so I have to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.489
 show up right? 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.959
 there is something else the wheel does not recommend in 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.680
 none of your vehicles 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.050
 the use of water only as a link 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.500
 cooling it recommends your 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.720
 the original coolant can be 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 to be bought on the wheel is a gallon of 3 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.930
 liters and 700 costs around 50 57 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.209
 depending on the concessionaire's and 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.329
 also from society and it is already ready 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.400
 purchased you can put it on the radiator in the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.410
 reservoir does not need any 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.420
 I do not need or need to add 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.739
 of water in the country adds water and 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.560
 comes in the ideal measure 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.060
 she recommends using it all over your car 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 in all their cars 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.069
 Okay, so this is it, everybody, they hug each other. 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.359
