into<00:02:06.680> one<00:02:06.830> big<00:02:07.100> game<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.880> would<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.119> pretty

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
into one big game that would be pretty

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.330 
into one big game that would be pretty
also<00:02:08.720> now<00:02:08.869> take<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.379> mind<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.009> only

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
also now take in mind that this is only

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.540 
also now take in mind that this is only
a<00:02:10.940> rumor<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.990> was<00:02:12.170> reported<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.590> IGN<00:02:13.130> Italy

is<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> happen<00:02:15.270> my<00:02:15.450> guess<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
is going to happen my guess is that it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.810 
is going to happen my guess is that it
definitely<00:02:16.320> will<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.190> release<00:02:17.580> date<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
definitely will the release date is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.940 
definitely will the release date is
supposed<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.050> Christmas<00:02:19.680> which

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
supposed to have in this Christmas which

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.380 
supposed to have in this Christmas which
is<00:02:20.100> odd<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.060> they

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
is odd because you would think they

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
is odd because you would think they
would<00:02:21.540> release<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.190> probably<00:02:23.190> before

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
would release this probably before

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.030 
would release this probably before
