a<00:02:41.060> look<00:02:41.269> at<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.660> most<00:02:41.930> cars<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
a look at this on most cars on the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.160 
a look at this on most cars on the
inside<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> door<00:02:43.340> over<00:02:43.670> here<00:02:44.170> you're

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
inside of the door over here you're

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.330 
inside of the door over here you're
gonna<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.470> something<00:02:45.680> which<00:02:45.860> will<00:02:46.010> tell<00:02:46.220> you

gonna have something which will tell you
what<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.579> correct<00:02:46.850> tire<00:02:47.120> pressure<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.780> to

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
what the correct tire pressure is to

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.020 
what the correct tire pressure is to
both<00:02:48.140> your<00:02:48.260> front<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.709> rear<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.880> might

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
both your front and rear and this might

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.160 
both your front and rear and this might
be<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.299> bit<00:02:50.390> hard<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.600> see<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:50.900> we've

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
be a little bit hard to see but we've

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.280 
be a little bit hard to see but we've
got<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> 35<00:02:51.890> psi<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:53.269> both<00:02:53.450> our<00:02:53.630> front<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.049> rear

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
got a 35 psi for both our front and rear

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.930 
got a 35 psi for both our front and rear
tires<00:02:54.650> that's<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.220> we<00:02:55.280> want<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.549> check<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
tires that's what we want to check and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.560 
tires that's what we want to check and
see<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.329> in<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.540> 35<00:02:57.280> psi<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.480> we're

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
see if it's in that 35 psi so we're

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.670 
see if it's in that 35 psi so we're
gonna<00:02:59.660> take<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.840> look<00:02:59.989> at<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.170> tires<00:03:00.380> now<00:03:00.470> we're

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
gonna take a look at the tires now we're

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.800 
gonna take a look at the tires now we're
gonna<00:03:00.799> check<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.220> air<00:03:01.340> pressure<00:03:01.549> on<00:03:01.850> all

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
gonna check the air pressure on all

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.699 
gonna check the air pressure on all
right<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.110> we're<00:03:03.200> gonna<00:03:03.290> check<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.590> air

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
right so we're gonna check the air

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.069 
right so we're gonna check the air
pressure<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.250> as<00:03:04.459> we<00:03:04.730> showed<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.329> these<00:03:05.570> we

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
pressure here as we showed on these we

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.470 
pressure here as we showed on these we
want<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.320> see<00:03:06.380> beyond<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> 35<00:03:07.190> psi<00:03:07.790> another

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
want to see beyond a 35 psi another

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.670 
want to see beyond a 35 psi another
important<00:03:08.840> thing<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.170> want<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.380> do<00:03:09.560> this

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
important thing is you want to do this

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680 
important thing is you want to do this
when<00:03:09.950> your<00:03:10.100> car<00:03:10.280> has<00:03:10.519> not<00:03:10.730> been<00:03:10.790> running<00:03:11.329> if

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
when your car has not been running if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.360 
when your car has not been running if
the<00:03:11.900> tires<00:03:12.140> are<00:03:12.380> hot<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:13.010> affect<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the tires are hot that can affect the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
the tires are hot that can affect the
air<00:03:13.489> pressure<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.239> don't<00:03:14.390> want<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.600> drive

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
air pressure so you don't want to drive

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.330 
air pressure so you don't want to drive
your<00:03:14.959> car<00:03:15.230> over<00:03:15.380> somewhere<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:15.950> immediately

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
your car over somewhere and immediately

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.069 
your car over somewhere and immediately
check<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.730> air<00:03:16.850> pressure<00:03:17.060> leave<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.900> for<00:03:18.019> a

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
check the air pressure leave it for a

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.390 
check the air pressure leave it for a
while<00:03:18.109> let<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.500> tires<00:03:18.829> cool<00:03:19.220> down<00:03:21.400> which

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
while let the tires cool down which

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.009 
while let the tires cool down which
allows<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.970> check<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.630> make<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.810> number

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
allows you to check it and make a number

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.030 
allows you to check it and make a number
of<00:03:24.079> different<00:03:24.320> types<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.680> air<00:03:24.920> pressure

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
of different types of air pressure

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.810 
of different types of air pressure
gauges<00:03:25.700> you're<00:03:26.420> going<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.810> put<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.109> on<00:03:27.820> and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
gauges you're going to put this on and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.720 
gauges you're going to put this on and
you'll<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.299> pop<00:03:29.540> out<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.549> look

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you'll see this pop out and if you look

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.550 
you'll see this pop out and if you look
at<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.510> right<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.079> it's<00:03:33.350> going

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
at it it's right on that it's going

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.259 
at it it's right on that it's going
little<00:03:33.799> bit<00:03:34.370> hard<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.609> see<00:03:34.820> but<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.090> right

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
little bit hard to see but it's right

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.170 
little bit hard to see but it's right
there<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.600> 35<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.560> about<00:03:36.709> perfect

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
there in 35 so that's just about perfect

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.310 
there in 35 so that's just about perfect
you<00:03:38.180> probably<00:03:38.420> want<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.630> check<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.049> couple

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
you probably want to check it a couple

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.449 
you probably want to check it a couple
different<00:03:39.590> times<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.980> want<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.160> check<00:03:40.310> all

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
different times you want to check all

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.350 
different times you want to check all
your<00:03:40.640> tires<00:03:40.910> make<00:03:41.329> sure<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.630> they're<00:03:41.840> Eve

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
your tires make sure that they're Eve

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.420 
your tires make sure that they're Eve
but<00:03:43.230> that's<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.440> real<00:03:43.590> good<00:03:43.770> thing<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.070> do<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
but that's a real good thing to do to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.370 
but that's a real good thing to do to
check<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.760> tire<00:03:45.030> pressure<00:03:45.420> at<00:03:45.750> least<00:03:45.810> once<00:03:46.290> a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
check that tire pressure at least once a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
check that tire pressure at least once a
month
