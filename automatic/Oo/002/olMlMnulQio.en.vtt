did around 800 graphs and I was able to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
did around 800 graphs and I was able to
do<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.239> nice<00:01:03.449> filling<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> crown

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

do some nice filling in of the crown
which<00:01:05.070> typically<00:01:05.489> probably<00:01:06.270> lasted<00:01:06.600> her

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
which typically probably lasted her

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.280
