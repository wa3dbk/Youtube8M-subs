something that I want to highlight this

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.470 
something that I want to highlight this
time<00:00:11.610> around<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:12.000> actually<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
time around it's actually the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.900 
time around it's actually the
differences<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.049> picking<00:00:13.559> your<00:00:13.679> race

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
differences in picking your race

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.650 
differences in picking your race
obviously<00:00:14.910> since<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> last<00:00:15.360> time<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.630> played

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
obviously since the last time I played

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.000 
obviously since the last time I played
this<00:00:15.900> or<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> first<00:00:16.410> time<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> plays<00:00:16.740> i<00:00:16.859> guess

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
this or the first time I plays i guess

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
this or the first time I plays i guess
it<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.609> Japanese<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.180> didn't<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.480> catch

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it was in Japanese I didn't really catch

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.689 
it was in Japanese I didn't really catch
everything<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.160> doing<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> in

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
everything but now that I'm doing it in

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460 
everything but now that I'm doing it in
English<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.600> choosing<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> race

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
English you can see that choosing a race

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.800 
English you can see that choosing a race
has<00:00:23.100> different<00:00:23.640> effects<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.539> character

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
has different effects for your character

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
has different effects for your character
so<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.170> example<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.710> saying<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.460> warrior

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
so for example with saying a warrior

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.550 
so for example with saying a warrior
tribe<00:00:27.210> has<00:00:27.449> low<00:00:27.689> health<00:00:27.930> by<00:00:28.109> high<00:00:28.289> attack

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
tribe has low health by high attack

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.140 
tribe has low health by high attack
power<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.279> specialize<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.760> attacking

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
power they specialize in attacking

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
power they specialize in attacking
attack<00:00:30.750> parallel<00:00:31.170> Reisman<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.740> low<00:00:32.009> health

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
attack parallel Reisman in low health

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
attack parallel Reisman in low health
and<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.640> recovered<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.329> KO<00:00:33.540> state<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and when recovered from a KO state and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
and when recovered from a KO state and
we<00:00:34.530> recovered<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.070> KO<00:00:35.280> state<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.820> stats

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we recovered from at KO state all stats

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
we recovered from at KO state all stats
will<00:00:36.570> rise<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.110> that's<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> same<00:00:38.340> aspect

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
will rise so that's the same aspect

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
will rise so that's the same aspect
works<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.140> damaged

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
works like that the more you get damaged

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
works like that the more you get damaged
the<00:00:40.680> more<00:00:40.920> powerfully<00:00:41.489> become<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:41.910> looks<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the more powerfully become from looks of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
the more powerfully become from looks of
it<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> met<00:00:43.050> game<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.739> race

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it and with the met game we have a race

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
it and with the met game we have a race
with<00:00:44.129> low<00:00:44.250> attack<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.789> high<00:00:45.000> health<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
with low attack but high health and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
with low attack but high health and
quick<00:00:45.690> guard<00:00:45.960> gauge<00:00:46.559> recovery<00:00:47.010> specialize<00:00:47.789> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
quick guard gauge recovery specialize in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.910 
quick guard gauge recovery specialize in
defense<00:00:48.329> keeling<00:00:49.020> islands<00:00:49.320> heal<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.739> than

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
defense keeling islands heal more than

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.470 
defense keeling islands heal more than
with<00:00:50.160> other<00:00:50.370> aces<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.000> also<00:00:51.180> auto

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
with other aces and they also auto

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.610 
with other aces and they also auto
generate<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> mental<00:00:52.170> health<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> low<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
generate a mental health is low so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
generate a mental health is low so
that's<00:00:52.860> pretty<00:00:52.980> cool<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.640> here's<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> other

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that's pretty cool but here's the other

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
that's pretty cool but here's the other
cool<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
cool thing when you actually get down to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
cool thing when you actually get down to
it<00:00:56.190> choosing<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> difference<00:00:57.180> between<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it choosing the difference between I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
it choosing the difference between I
mean<00:00:58.170> choosing<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> different<00:00:58.859> genders

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
mean choosing the different genders

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.470 
mean choosing the different genders
actually<00:00:59.760> has<00:00:59.850> different<00:01:00.120> effects<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.449> well

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually has different effects as well

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
actually has different effects as well
as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> button<00:01:01.590> says<00:01:01.710> males

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
as you can see on the button says males

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
as you can see on the button says males
have<00:01:02.160> stronger<00:01:02.550> regular<00:01:02.820> attacks<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.329> buffs

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have stronger regular attacks and buffs

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
have stronger regular attacks and buffs
last<00:01:03.870> longer<00:01:04.260> special<00:01:04.979> skills<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.369> slightly

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
last longer special skills are slightly

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
last longer special skills are slightly
weaker<00:01:06.000> females<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.840> higher<00:01:07.080> recovery

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
weaker females have higher recovery

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
weaker females have higher recovery
rates<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.920> key<00:01:08.070> gauges<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> garden<00:01:08.880> gauges

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
rates for key gauges and garden gauges

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
rates for key gauges and garden gauges
but<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.630> less<00:01:09.840> health<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.439> that's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
but they have less health so that's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
but they have less health so that's
actually<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.549> cool<00:01:11.670> addition<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
actually pretty cool addition in this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.000 
actually pretty cool addition in this
game<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> mech<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> know

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
game obviously when the mech you know

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280 
game obviously when the mech you know
you<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.850> gender<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> can't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you only have one gender so you can't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
you only have one gender so you can't
actually<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.770> through<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> um<00:01:17.869> back<00:01:18.869> up

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
actually go through that and um back up

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
actually go through that and um back up
you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:20.330> choosing

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you can actually go through choosing

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
you can actually go through choosing
different<00:01:21.950> stats<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.610> let's<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.820> out

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
different stats there but let's go out
