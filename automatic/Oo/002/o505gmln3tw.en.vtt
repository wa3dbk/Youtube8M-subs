00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.010
 let's learn how we want to grab money to teach them how to knit 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.359
 crochet 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.699
 well up here is the tip 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.699
 let's put in the shot mind 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.089
 we are going for a spin 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.439
 we already take 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 it was the area of ​​cydia riva 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.960
 and we are going to win it with these processes 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.970
 Two decades 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.189
 in this way 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.840
 happening once 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.460
 already having washington 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.480
 our hook now 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 let's grab it with the right hand 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.080
 these two fingers give here 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.520
 and the crochet 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.650
 is going to be flipping towards you 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.930
 because this will help us boxmar the stamen 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.290
 or the book 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 well this is from the brave 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.420
 and this one helps us we will support then with those three for bouquets the crochet 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.770
 enter 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.200
 by the area above 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
 we went back 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 let's keep going 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.970
 we hooked 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.200
 we continue to where the fingers are and there 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 for bouquets that have the offers 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 to have a circle 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.310
 because this is going to be our base 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.560
 we put the hook 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.220
 did not catch mons 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.330
 here 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.640
 we speak and they enter 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 so it's the circle that we have here 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 The truth is that I am moving, but fingers are the right thing to do 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 always yes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.440
 good wood 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.880
 we passed 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.200
 we hooked 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.510
 we take out 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.650
 again 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.770
 Macías goes to John 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.760
 we start 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.970
 we take out 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.320
 good with these chains already 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.340
 we go then to carragher and not fix the route 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.549
 because if you can appreciate yourself 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.599
 the first points fall apart then 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.889
 already here I do not know if it is for so much from there 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.329
 let's start your faculty this already has a point 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.059
 the note 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.579
 this genre sands 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.649
 quest what we are doing 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.439
 we take out 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.439
 we take out 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.579
 we need at the beginning this time a news 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 it is normal if one chain is larger than the other 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.489
 but the correct thing is that all are 5 alex 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.499
 and this is with practice 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.499
 well you are knitting there 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.489
 this part is growing 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.560
 and it becomes more difficult to weave therefore your fingers move them and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.720
 cramps towards the beginning of the tissue that is where we where we really go 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.519
 jagland 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.719
 shakhtar again the hoe 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.099
 stand out 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.019
 the strada 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:18.940
 shakhtar 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.380
 lazaro báez do this durán sar is when I arrived and hooked him if he 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.399
 fix 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.979
 we put 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.340
 and I cut the hook 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.359
 a little bit up so that the hook allows me 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.689
 percent grab mourners 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.589
 carlos pizá 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.009
 to again with this challenge 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.430
 yes I have the fabric 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.329
 to prevent her from grabbing 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.279
 and so continue weaving 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.219
 I hope this 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.749
 I support here who helped me 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.579
 may you also serve him sometimes I do sometimes support me the 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.469
 another but 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.249
 of gea one really with few fingers but with others in some way 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.409
 They are serving us 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.479
 so you have to practice 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.039
 and since we wanted an aunt couple with chains 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.030
 all of the same size 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.920
 then we are ready to continue with another point 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.609
 I've really wanted to believe me, it's very interesting 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.080
 this seems simple of chain and with what for what serves people 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.669
 for many things since you have a long strip 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.599
 it's so good it depends on the thickness of the ice they use 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.539
 but for example this bet even a bracelet are made several chains 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.819
 strips of chains of different colors very nice illusion 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.270
 also for some sometimes it may be to do to zoom in on those 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.659
 hang to a belt 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.659
 For many, it's a lot of things that you think you're going to like 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.809
 nearby source including a spokesperson 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.879
 Uncle chains through back grabs the tissue upload it 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.619
 two chains and they come back up as you feel comfortable 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.569
 that is very well many greetings and until next time
