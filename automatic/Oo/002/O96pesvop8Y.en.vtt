00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400 

in<00:00:00.089> a<00:00:00.299> lease<00:00:00.570> it's<00:00:00.750> like<00:00:00.870> you're<00:00:00.989> backing<00:00:01.319> in

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
in a lease it's like you're backing in

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.619 
in a lease it's like you're backing in
between<00:00:01.680> two<00:00:01.860> buildings<00:00:02.040> or<00:00:02.580> finale<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.510> it's

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
between two buildings or finale and it's

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.349 
between two buildings or finale and it's
just<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.840> straight<00:00:04.110> back<00:00:04.670> the<00:00:05.670> rule<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:05.879> as<00:00:06.240> long

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
just a straight back the rule is as long

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.760 
just a straight back the rule is as long
as<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.569> don't<00:00:06.750> hit<00:00:06.899> any<00:00:07.049> cones<00:00:07.200> or<00:00:07.440> go<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
as you don't hit any cones or go on the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.140 
as you don't hit any cones or go on the
outside<00:00:08.220> edges<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.730> them<00:00:09.230> you'll<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.380> okay<00:00:11.150> so

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
outside edges of them you'll be okay so

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.640 
outside edges of them you'll be okay so
that's<00:00:12.480> what<00:00:12.630> he's<00:00:12.750> probably<00:00:13.080> doing<00:00:13.380> right

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
that's what he's probably doing right

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.950 
that's what he's probably doing right
here<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.880> think<00:00:15.120> at<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> end<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
here and I think at the end of them you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
here and I think at the end of them you
got<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.260> stop<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> certain<00:00:17.010> radius<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.699> i'll

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
got to stop in a certain radius so i'll

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.700 
got to stop in a certain radius so i'll
show<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:18.840> mean<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:19.230> when<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.410> got<00:00:19.560> here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
show you what i mean by when we got here

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
show you what i mean by when we got here
close<00:00:19.920> i<00:00:20.279> don't<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.480> anybody's<00:00:21.840> coming<00:00:22.020> so

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
close i don't think anybody's coming so

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.490 
close i don't think anybody's coming so
we<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> notice<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.260> here

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
we all go as you notice one way here

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.599 
we all go as you notice one way here
that's<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.369> hit<00:00:26.580> each

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that's just so that we don't hit each

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.580 
that's just so that we don't hit each
other<00:00:26.849> there's<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.050> speed<00:00:28.439> limit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
other there's not really a speed limit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.220 
other there's not really a speed limit
here<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.390> directional<00:00:30.390> limit<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
here or a directional limit but so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.120 
here or a directional limit but so
here's<00:00:34.230> where<00:00:34.380> you'd<00:00:34.620> start<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.010> you're

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
here's where you'd start if you're

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
here's where you'd start if you're
taking<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> test<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> start<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> between

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
taking the test you start in between

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.600 
taking the test you start in between
these<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:36.960> cones<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.250> drive<00:00:38.489> forward

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
these two cones and you drive forward

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.529 
these two cones and you drive forward
just<00:00:41.610> drive<00:00:41.820> straight<00:00:41.969> forward<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:44.300> would<00:00:45.300> do

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
just drive straight forward I would do

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
just drive straight forward I would do
this<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.800> actual<00:00:47.070> truck<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.910> don't

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this in an actual truck but I don't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
this in an actual truck but I don't
think<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.660> supposed<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> drive<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> hold<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
think we're supposed to drive and hold a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
think we're supposed to drive and hold a
camera<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> same<00:00:50.670> time<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
camera at the same time but that's not

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.400 
camera at the same time but that's not
as<00:00:52.739> easy<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.129> looks<00:00:53.340> once<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> done

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
as easy it looks once you get it done

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
as easy it looks once you get it done
pretty<00:00:55.410> easy<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.600> two

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
pretty easy so as you see these two

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
pretty easy so as you see these two
cones<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.550> they<00:00:59.550> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> gap<00:01:00.030> in

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cones right here they kind of gap in

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
cones right here they kind of gap in
between<00:01:00.329> each<00:01:00.539> other<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
between each other so what you do is you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399 
between each other so what you do is you
come<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.480> stop<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
come up here and you stop it and if you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
come up here and you stop it and if you
stop<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.830> somewhere<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.700> between<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:06.150> ok

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
stop it somewhere in between your ok

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.289 
stop it somewhere in between your ok
then<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> pull<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> way<00:01:07.830> forward

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
then you pull it all the way forward

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.340 
then you pull it all the way forward
your<00:01:09.299> trailers<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.320> sure

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
your trailers all the way out make sure

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.660 
your trailers all the way out make sure
it's<00:01:10.500> straight<00:01:10.799> usually<00:01:11.220> find<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> reference

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it's straight usually find a reference

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's straight usually find a reference
point<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.360> usually<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> end<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
point I usually use the end of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
point I usually use the end of the
airplane<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.100> somewhere<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.850> between<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
airplane or somewhere in between the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
airplane or somewhere in between the
airplane<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.810> tree<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
airplane in that tree and then you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
airplane in that tree and then you
basically<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.580> straight<00:01:18.119> back<00:01:18.299> through<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
basically just straight back through the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
basically just straight back through the
cones<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.619> close<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.159> side<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
cones and you get close to one side of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
cones and you get close to one side of
the<00:01:20.549> other<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> big<00:01:21.689> deal<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.080> long<00:01:22.140> as

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the other it's not a big deal as long as

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.690 
the other it's not a big deal as long as
you<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.500> hit<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> cones<00:01:22.830> across<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.580> them

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you don't hit the cones across over them

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
you don't hit the cones across over them
and<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.439> you'll<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:27.320> all<00:01:28.320> right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and you know you'll be good all right

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
and you know you'll be good all right
this<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:30.869> tricky

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this one is a little bit more tricky

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.609 
this one is a little bit more tricky
this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> alley<00:01:32.310> doc<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.619> well

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
this is the alley doc and this is well

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
this is the alley doc and this is well
it's<00:01:34.799> pretty<00:01:35.040> typical<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.299> probably

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's pretty typical to what you probably

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's pretty typical to what you probably
be<00:01:36.780> doing<00:01:37.079> most<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> truck

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
be doing most of the time as a truck

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.080 
be doing most of the time as a truck
driver<00:01:39.500> just<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> usually
