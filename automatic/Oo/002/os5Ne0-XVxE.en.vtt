00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: And to the coming
of Hurricane Irene. The storm bulked up today

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.830
and headed toward the U.S. mainland. Palm
trees still whipped in the wind and rain today,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.519
and waves battered white sand beaches, after
Irene marched through the Turks and Caicos

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.380
Islands chain overnight. Flooding from the
storm displaced hundreds of people in the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.509
Dominican Republic. And even though Cuba was
out of the direct path, the storm sent waves

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.090
crashing over a seawall in Baracoa. Today,
the Bahamas braced for the effects, as the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.160
season's first Atlantic hurricane reached
Category 3 status, with winds topping 120

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.850
miles an hour. Next in Irene's sights after
the islands of the Caribbean, the Eastern

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.730
Seaboard of the U.S., especially the North
Carolina coast, where people were already

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.120
stocking up on emergency supplies. MAN: Last
time we had an outage, the tornado, we had

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.329
no radio. So we thought now's the time to
make sure we do. JEFFREY BROWN: Along with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:10.789
year-round residents, large numbers of late-summer
visitors from around the country were at the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:18.210
Carolina beaches this week. Some were forced
to leave by ferry from Ocracoke, after a mandatory

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.119
evacuation was ordered for everyone on the
tiny barrier island along the Outer Banks.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.539
MAN: It's a low-lying island, and if it's
a bad storm that hits directly, it won't take

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.969
much of an elevation of sea level to create
a lot of havoc over there. There aren't many

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.899
high spots on Ocracoke Island. JEFFREY BROWN:
North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue warned people

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.180
not to take Irene lightly. GOV. BEVERLY PERDUE,
D-N.C.: We know she -- at this point in time,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.010
Hurricane Irene is a big storm -- 115 mile-an-hour
wind is a big wind. Get your evacuation kit

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.210
ready. Get your medicines ready. Take your
insurance documents and have a plan to get

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.230
out if you have to. Treat this seriously.
But then pray real hard that North Carolina

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.670
will be fine. JEFFREY BROWN: Farther north,
New Englanders were prepping for the storm's

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.720
possible arrival in a few more days, including
at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where President

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.190
Obama was vacationing. A spokesman said he's
getting updates from Craig Fugate, head of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.110
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. JOSH
EARNEST, White House deputy press secretary:

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
This is somebody that is a legitimate expert
on these issues. These kinds of logistical

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.660
issues are an important part of that effort.
That's why we're so closely -- in such close

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.720
communication and consultation with state
and local officials up and down the Eastern

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.690
Seaboard. JEFFREY BROWN: Irene has already
dumped heavy rain on Puerto Rico. And more

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.910
than a million people there lost electrical
power as the storm hit. President Obama declared

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.970
a state of emergency for the U.S. territory.
And for the latest on Irene and what to expect

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.660
in the days ahead, we turn to Jim Kosek, senior
meteorologist with AccuWeather.com. Thanks

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.280
for joining us. So, where the storm now and
what's the immediate path look like? JIM KOSEK,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.040
AccuWeather meteorologist: Well, still moving
off to the northwest at about 12 miles per

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.200
hour here, Jeff. And it looks like that motion
is going to continue throughout the nighttime

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.620
hours. It's over the southeastern Bahamas,
still well off to the south by a couple hundred

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.760
miles getting away from Nassau and Freeport
in the northern Bahamas. But the damage is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.870
going to be done over the next 24 hours in
this location. As a matter of fact, when the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.090
storm develops an eye, you get the corresponding
eyewall. That's the meat and potatoes of the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.090
storm system where the damage is done. So
on the northern-eastern flank of the storm

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.950
system, even though it's going to be going
just off to the east of Nassau, as well as

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.350
Freeport, we're still going to have a lot
of rain and a lot of problem with the wind

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.820
in this area, as we're probably ramping up
the storm system, probably getting Category

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.370
4 over the next 24 hours. So we're going to
be expecting this 131 to 155 miles per hour.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.621
That's ridiculous, Jeff. JEFFREY BROWN: So
you have got quite a wide swathe of the East

00:03:55.621 --> 00:04:00.570
Coast of the U.S. now. What's the level of
certainty -- or what are the factors when

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.520
you look at where it might make landfall and
where hit the hardest? JIM KOSEK: A couple

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.551
things we're looking at. The Bermuda high
pressure is pretty strong this time of the

00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.173
year and given the clockwise steering flow
around that, it's definitely going to take

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:17.000
off it to the northwest tonight. But there
are a couple troughs or cold fronts moving

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.579
through the Midwest right now. That's one
aspect with the severe weather over Michigan

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.410
and Indiana currently, but also over the -- kind
of the Northwest and through British Columbia

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.380
and Alberta. That's another cool front that
is going to make it on in through the Great

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.130
Lakes and Northeast on Saturday. That's going
to help draw the storm system in. And one

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.810
thing to keep in mind, the storm track goes
to the path of least resistance, where the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.400
pressure is going to be lowest. So it's going
to cut into those cold fronts before it eventually

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.150
gets swept out. That's why we think it's a
pretty good likelihood that we're going to

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.890
have hurricane-force -- major hurricane-force
conditions along the coast of North Carolina

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.129
as we roll in on in through Saturday afternoon,
Saturday night, and perhaps Category 2 coming

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.889
up to Long Island and Category 1 for the remainder
of New England late this weekend. JEFFREY

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.620
BROWN: Well, we saw the -- we just saw some
pictures of people getting prepared in North

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.580
Carolina. Those are -- you know, it's the
height of the summer season. These are some

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.969
tough economic decisions, I guess, for local
officials. So, your advice right now is, they're

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.910
doing the right thing to get prepared, especially
in North Carolina, right? JIM KOSEK: Absolutely.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.499
And I don't want to just shrug off the reminder
of the Southeast, because this is also a setup,

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.849
any part of Florida on northbound, where you're
probably not dealing with much in terms of

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.580
wind. It won't even get tropical storm right
up through Georgia or South Carolina, but

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.990
you're contending with rough surf and lots
of beach erosion. So anywhere from Miami on

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.759
northbound, you at least have those problems.
So if you think you're venturing into the

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.409
water, you have to keep in mind that Irene
is a very, very large storm system, much like

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.409
dropping a plunger into the ocean. So the
effects in terms of rough surf and rip currents

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.759
already felt along Florida's coastline and
even as far north as, say, Fire Island on

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.129
Long Island east of New York City starting
tomorrow. JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and briefly,

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.580
just you mentioned going all the way up into
New England, that -- some talk about it being

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.741
the biggest storm to hit up there in quite
a long while. JIM KOSEK: Quite a long while,

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:15.949
indeed. We remember Hurricane Bob back from
1991, also Bertha and Fran from '96. So, Floyd

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.879
from '99 didn't have a lot of wind, but a
lot of rain associated with it. But this could

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.999
actually be the strongest storm system since
1938 to come up in through this area, so a

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.939
lot of damage. And, unfortunately, this is
just getting its act together. Even though

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.309
it is going to be weakening once it gets north
of Cape Hatteras due to a little bit more

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.639
wind shear and cooler waters, you're still
talking about a hurricane nonetheless. JEFFREY

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.611
BROWN: All right, one to watch. Joe Kosek
