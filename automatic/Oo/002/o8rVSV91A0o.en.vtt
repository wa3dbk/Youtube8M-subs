maybe<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.300> someone's<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:40.870> front<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.520> and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
maybe if someone's in front of you and

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.830 
maybe if someone's in front of you and
you're<00:03:42.760> walking<00:03:43.180> or<00:03:43.330> you're<00:03:43.450> riding<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.810> bike

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
you're walking or you're riding a bike

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.110 
you're walking or you're riding a bike
you<00:03:44.470> let<00:03:44.650> someone<00:03:44.890> know<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.160> you're<00:03:45.760> coming

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you let someone know that you're coming

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.000 
you let someone know that you're coming
up<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.420> they<00:03:46.660> need<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.200> get<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.920> way

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
up and they need to get out of the way

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.979 
up and they need to get out of the way
so<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.430> say<00:03:48.550> coming<00:03:48.850> through<00:03:49.239> which

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
so you can say coming through which

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.990 
so you can say coming through which
means<00:03:50.200> people<00:03:50.530> will<00:03:50.650> move<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.610> get<00:03:51.700> out<00:03:51.760> of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
means people will move to get out of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.270 
means people will move to get out of
your<00:03:52.120> way<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:53.230> next<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.830> pretty

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
your way and the next one is pretty

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.640 
your way and the next one is pretty
similar<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.880> well<00:03:55.000> heads<00:03:55.420> up<00:03:55.690> someone<00:03:56.500> says

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
similar as well heads up someone says

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.220 
similar as well heads up someone says
heads<00:03:56.890> up<00:03:57.070> which<00:03:57.850> means<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:58.390> watch<00:03:58.810> out<00:03:59.050> or

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
heads up which means just watch out or

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.500 
heads up which means just watch out or
be<00:03:59.350> careful<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.459> could<00:04:00.700> use<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.030> like

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
be careful so you could use it like

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.479 
be careful so you could use it like
coming<00:04:01.900> through<00:04:02.230> as<00:04:02.350> well<00:04:02.380> or<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:02.830> could<00:04:03.400> let

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
coming through as well or you could let

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.970 
coming through as well or you could let
someone<00:04:03.760> know<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:04.630> there's<00:04:05.380> something<00:04:05.620> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
someone know that there's something that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.400 
someone know that there's something that
they<00:04:06.310> need<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.489> watch<00:04:06.760> out<00:04:06.970> for<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.420> these<00:04:08.050> two

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
they need to watch out for so these two

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.310 
they need to watch out for so these two
phrases<00:04:08.920> are<00:04:09.400> quite<00:04:10.000> similar<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:10.930> we<00:04:11.020> can<00:04:11.170> use

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
phrases are quite similar but we can use

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.990 
phrases are quite similar but we can use
them<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.800> few<00:04:11.980> different<00:04:12.280> ways<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.610> you'll

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
them in a few different ways and you'll

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.120 
them in a few different ways and you'll
hear<00:04:13.209> them<00:04:13.330> in<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.600> movie<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.830> those<00:04:14.980> are

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
hear them in this movie so those are

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.520 
hear them in this movie so those are
three<00:04:15.400> pretty<00:04:15.790> simple<00:04:16.239> words<00:04:16.450> but<00:04:16.750> pay

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
three pretty simple words but pay

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.409 
three pretty simple words but pay
attention<00:04:17.890> again<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.310> how<00:04:18.430> quickly<00:04:18.880> they<00:04:19.180> talk

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
attention again to how quickly they talk

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.570 
attention again to how quickly they talk
so<00:04:19.690> we<00:04:19.810> hope<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.530> enjoy<00:04:20.830> this<00:04:21.010> movie<00:04:21.370> there's
