one of the most known little villages I

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.070 
one of the most known little villages I
guess<00:00:28.030> because<00:00:28.270> you<00:00:28.420> starting<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.840> feel<00:00:29.050> a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
guess because you starting to feel a

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.740 
guess because you starting to feel a
train<00:00:29.290> start<00:00:29.590> Skyrim<00:00:29.920> so<00:00:30.250> every<00:00:31.120> little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
train start Skyrim so every little

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.770 
train start Skyrim so every little
village<00:00:32.140> or<00:00:32.410> city<00:00:32.710> has<00:00:32.949> her<00:00:33.100> own<00:00:33.129> team<00:00:33.699> so<00:00:34.600> for

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
village or city has her own team so for

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.200 
village or city has her own team so for
example<00:00:34.809> whiterun<00:00:35.649> is<00:00:35.890> always<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> sand<00:00:36.910> and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
example whiterun is always a sand and

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.180 
example whiterun is always a sand and
everything<00:00:37.510> it's<00:00:37.629> sort<00:00:37.870> of<00:00:37.989> big<00:00:38.199> sant<00:00:38.559> Gastel

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
everything it's sort of big sant Gastel

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.310 
everything it's sort of big sant Gastel
and<00:00:39.429> in<00:00:39.940> window<00:00:40.300> home<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.629> example<00:00:40.989> it's<00:00:41.109> just

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
and in window home for example it's just

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.169 
and in window home for example it's just
green<00:00:41.589> a<00:00:41.649> little<00:00:41.829> bit<00:00:42.190> more<00:00:42.309> vegetation<00:00:42.820> than

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
green a little bit more vegetation than

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.450 
green a little bit more vegetation than
usual<00:00:43.570> what<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.409> mod<00:00:44.620> creator<00:00:45.069> want<00:00:45.339> to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
usual what the mod creator want to

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.369 
usual what the mod creator want to
achieve<00:00:45.789> and<00:00:46.059> well<00:00:46.600> they<00:00:46.749> actually<00:00:47.109> want<00:00:47.289> to

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
achieve and well they actually want to

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.410 
achieve and well they actually want to
keep<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.679> I<00:00:47.829> guess<00:00:48.190> sort<00:00:48.699> of<00:00:48.789> more<00:00:48.999> friendly

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420
