00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 the girls, good morning, good morning, I'll show you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.580
 for you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.359
 this hairstyle here so let's check it out 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 tutorial 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 You have to be with your hair done. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 preferably brushed made of iron 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
 If your hair is straight, you do not need to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 first he use the silicone snacks 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 To learn all the hair here. 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.930
 well the first one we look at that part 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 here we are going to separate the 15 connie and this 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.540
 part does not make a normal ponytail 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.020
 It's very loud here I learned and this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 Part and back here we'll start 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 with this part is divided into two parts 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 here grips a back of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.809
 hair is not replicated 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.980
 My chain is quite a bit complicated to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 do 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.219
 So I went straight is much better then it is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.420
 that we get a lock of hair and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.450
 will join here in the middle will braid 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 as if it were a normal braid will 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.200
 hold here picks up another wick of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.439
 hair back here goes forward 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:29.119
 joins with the middle hair caught here 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:32.930
 below also braid this court 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.250
 safe take more hair down here 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.840
 pass on to the front 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 along with the middle was more hair here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:51.450
 underneath and braid takes one more 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.560
 hair facing the joint with the middle 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.460
 and take the rest of the hair here from 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.460
 low and trans safe 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.730
 I left a little thread to give a way 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.470
 and this part we will put a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.260
 garnish for not to stay 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.750
 apparent to here I'd put this 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.390

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.040
