00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.060
 so the purpose of lucena is to check that you are when you inject 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.439
 efforts to inject 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.300
 deform but resistance 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.819
 September 21 by the Senate 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.019
 so what does that mean 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.439
 use precise calculation methods 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.439
 eventually finally we will be able 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 for assemblies 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.320
 without this will make babies from other areas of fashion like those 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 magazine's point 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.640
 all configurations for melbourne 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.970
 because it's quite spectacular not much 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.230
 when we will start to reach in total 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.870
 460 euros everything starts singing 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.740
 the dimension on the situation in the standard dimension board 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.820
 whenever we could celebrate with the same desire 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 Thursday around 11 2 meters 40 km 40 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 the sensitive building for 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.660
 to formalize use 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.030
 and percent 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 to read this classic way with classic wood panels in France 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.290
 we are going to break 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 the iphone 5 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 Why 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 that's why it's 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.580
 perfect weekend 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.630
 as for the fracture 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.480
 the part of the general public 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 taylor in the background it's definitely there 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 here is the 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 look at the case to follow 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.449
 do not go and share it with you 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.449
 the Web 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.529
 really not paying attention to the bubble 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.839
 many things can happen 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.239
 in the underground trap 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 to make up for both festive 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.019
 this information in place 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.189
 in Europe 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.189
 the looks 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.079
 if opportunities to penetrate 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.919
 you have for example 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.449
 2 tm 3 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.289
 the other 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.349
 what does it mean for us 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.459
 we are impossible 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.659
 2006 conventional conventional repeats that is to say with a little 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.869
 who respects in terms of creating panels term of 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.519
 fixation and physical density on the minimum 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 okay not representative request 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.600
 the strength points of this type of structure 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.699
 this to the extent that these structures that are very very light 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.909
 in the face of the earthquake it behaves better 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.139
 behaves better since hours 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.520
 the way these calculations and that's the strength that is the opportunity to try it 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.879
 the mass multiplied by the association to the extent that the mass the flesh 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.919
 you have an effort that is less 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.120
 facing these attacks it's true for all light structures so that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.789
 still remains a training point 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.060
 marketed in the Caribbean it may be interesting I think 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059
 it's more than one it was 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.069
 once I think it's thanks to her it's because I was hoping 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.029
 the safest 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.059
 No doubt that success is so successful
