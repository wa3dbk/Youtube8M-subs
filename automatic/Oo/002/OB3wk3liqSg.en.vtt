00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.270
 an autumn makeup that's 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.340
 precisely what he asked us for 798 and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.930
 what we will do in this video the fall is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.119
 this these 100 that begin to defoliate 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.740
 the trees and the weather starts cooling 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.720
 However, it does not have to be a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.699
 colorless boring season everything 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.259
 contrary this day we are going to inspire 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.269
 in the leaves of the trees to make 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.550
 a look with earth tones we are going to 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.070
 start this where I toÃ±o with is well and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.199
 a colored building is in crisis 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 chocolate brown because it has its 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.309
 bright stars and what I want 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.739
 to do is apply this color in all my 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.900
 moving body and has worked for me as 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.720
 base to my shadows and also as a base 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.159
 my color for its finish if it is not 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.739
 mentalized and simply as 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.570
 communicated a little bit bright and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.769
 texture we want to make the look been 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.089
 a little bit more interesting than 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.089
 simply shadow 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.690
 and about the truth I meant shade in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.080
 normal overrun powder from which 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 we use 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 in the top volvo and I'm also going to 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.510
 trace through the bottom and I will create a 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.430
 line that can be quite thick as 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.020
 see this does not allow me to create very lines 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.780
 delicate so do not worry if the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.210
 create thick line is this is a crazy 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.210
 Pretty dark is not like for the night 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 and here I am creating the forms that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 give a few elongated palms 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 make it look like rounded and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 I finished delicately 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.900
 and a swab and perfected 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 now let's take the palette is the flow 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 on the platform without eagerness to concentrate these 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.740
 slightly brown colors and chocolates 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 that are perfect for autumn and we're going to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.310
 enter first this brown color more 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.319
 dark that you will not take with a brush 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.070
 a little thick so this is not going to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.570
 take too much color just a little 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.830
 and now what I'm going to do is review this 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.830
 color with my edges 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.110
 that's why I do not want it to be something very 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.760
 strong because he wants to be something blurred 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.070
 these brushes that have the hairs a 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.070
 little more separated are ideal for that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.240
 of course I do rest a bit by the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.980
 part inside very carefully because 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.560
 It is also quite thick 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.250
 if you want to take a little more that is 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.250
 very delicate 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.120
 and something like that we want it to be now 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 go back to take my same palette and I'm going to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 take this brown that is a little more 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.600
 Clear 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.240
 and how can you see if he had an unusual 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.670
 flat and wet so I concentrate on the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.670
 color in the games is to press this 4 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.520
 little by little concentrating my color 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.850
 single mobile eyelid we find colors 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.860
 truth is little but it draws attention and 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.860
 makes it look more polished 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 the shadow will be different so finished 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.519
 on a mobile it's going to be a little more 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.060
 I'm going to pass 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.849
 but being there what I can do is 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.980
 it is simply to apply it in the part 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.080
 inside of impacted so much superior 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.420
 as inferior it has a dark color 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.959
 could use medium but the pass 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.959
 back interesting and aside trial 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.959
 bars 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.290
 if you want you can do this step is 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.380
 celebration but very little of what 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.780
 some little in the tear but very 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.950
 I do not want this to contaminate everything 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.950
 what what dark 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.050
 it is the body 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.729
 and imagine it outside with some eyelashes 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.190
 full of volume so it will be better 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.810
 that the volume and of course is going to 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.270
 apply basically where the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.009
 unmask save superior functions 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.830
 as 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.490
 because I want the tabs to frame 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.490
 very much 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.330
 and something like that should be the eyes now 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.889
 let's move on to the rest of the face 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.689
 now you want to take a town that we are 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.270
 dark that your skin and operas or use 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.620
 is verified in third parties and now with 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.389
 a brush for the face of what is going to 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.580
 to do is to sink law and I'm going to start 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.379
 give a little bit of shape then like everything 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.060
 the hair collected 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.879
 I want to balance my face then 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.650
 move as a shape on the cheekbones 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.180
 also here on the forehead 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.120
 I want to be distracting a little got off 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.160
 towards the double chin I got darker in 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.480
 the difference here there is no x-men 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.700
 you have to be something that is 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.590
 relatively subtle that it would seem that 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.570
 these shadows are normally in your 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.570
 face so something subtle 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.790
 why 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.590
 it's good I maybe I did not do it so 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.450
 subtle but if it was night it can do 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.730
 a little more marks our final touch 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.040
 will be the lip of I think with this wave 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.170
 very happiness of the leaves in shoots 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.800
 as well as using these there are more than worth 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.800
 the minister 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.860
 so use this material in 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.020
 caipirinha that I also thought was super 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.639
 button and now this color I use it 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.990
 to give me volume if I want to apply 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.990
 those that everything in the center 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.850
 and with that we finish the look for autumn 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.260
 that you requested when you saw 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.030
 our video for spring by 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.680
 course we can make the station that 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.960
 has on one side of the world and not the one 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.700
 they have the other so I really hope 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.700
 that you will like and we will see you a video
