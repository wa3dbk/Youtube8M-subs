arm and then rotate underneath like so a
wrap<00:02:16.459> around<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.440> same<00:02:18.470> thing

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
wrap around like that do the same thing

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.890 
wrap around like that do the same thing
with<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.370> other<00:02:19.459> side<00:02:19.580> take<00:02:20.570> his<00:02:20.690> other<00:02:20.840> arm

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
with the other side take his other arm

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.560 
with the other side take his other arm
and<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.950> want<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.190> rotate<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.970> down<00:02:23.270> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
and you want to rotate this down and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.600 
and you want to rotate this down and
around<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.709> it's<00:02:24.920> like<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
around so it's like that and then you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.520 
around so it's like that and then you
want<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.820> take<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> back<00:02:29.300> half<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.870> push<00:02:30.380> that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
want to take the back half and push that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.130 
want to take the back half and push that
down<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.890> reveal<00:02:31.100> his<00:02:31.370> head<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.870> take

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
down to reveal his head and then take

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.280 
down to reveal his head and then take
this<00:02:34.120> part<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.600> can<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.600> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
this part here if I can do this and it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.240 
this part here if I can do this and it
feels<00:02:39.320> like<00:02:39.590> you're<00:02:39.680> gonna<00:02:39.740> break<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.010> but

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
feels like you're gonna break it but

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
feels like you're gonna break it but
you're<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.880> then<00:02:41.480> until<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.019> hear<00:02:42.170> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you're not and then until you hear it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.540 
you're not and then until you hear it
snap<00:02:42.350> into<00:02:42.620> place<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.400> then

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
snap into place just like that and then

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.300 
snap into place just like that and then
with<00:02:47.480> his<00:02:47.630> arm<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.050> kind<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.200> rotate<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> arm

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
with his arm just kind of rotate the arm

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.430 
with his arm just kind of rotate the arm
down<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.030> do<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> same<00:02:50.900> thing<00:02:51.080> with

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
down like that do the same thing with

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.590 
down like that do the same thing with
the<00:02:51.560> other<00:02:51.650> arm<00:02:52.060> bring<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.180> down<00:02:53.300> like<00:02:53.330> that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
the other arm bring it down like that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.240 
the other arm bring it down like that
and<00:02:53.660> there<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.350> smokescreen

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and there you have smokescreen

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.699 
and there you have smokescreen
and<00:02:55.340> here's<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.269> robot<00:02:56.540> mode<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.530> want

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
and here's it robot mode then you want

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.140 
and here's it robot mode then you want
to<00:02:57.739> take<00:02:57.980> his<00:02:58.220> chain<00:02:59.090> bolt<00:02:59.330> or<00:02:59.480> he<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.810> hold<00:03:00.050> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
to take his chain bolt or he can hold it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.530 
to take his chain bolt or he can hold it
plug<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.269> into<00:03:02.450> his<00:03:02.600> hand<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.510> I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
plug that into his hand like that so I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.180 
plug that into his hand like that so I
guess<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.320> little<00:03:06.440> bit<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.160> little

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
guess it's a little bit it's a little

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.920 
guess it's a little bit it's a little
bit<00:03:07.370> tricky<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.330> easy<00:03:08.570> once<00:03:08.810> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
bit tricky but it can be easy once you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.640 
bit tricky but it can be easy once you
practice<00:03:09.140> at<00:03:09.470> it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
practice at it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.590 
practice at it
so<00:03:10.130> that's<00:03:10.310> hours<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.000> hours<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.360> me

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
so that's hours and hours of me

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840 
so that's hours and hours of me
practicing<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:12.670> that's<00:03:13.670> how

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
practicing with it so it's that's how

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.699 
practicing with it so it's that's how
you<00:03:13.910> want<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.150> look<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.360> robot<00:03:14.660> mode<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.530> let's

mode<00:04:13.330> you<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.660> take<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.960> chain<00:04:14.170> bolster<00:04:14.500> and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
mode you can take the chain bolster and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.440 
mode you can take the chain bolster and
plug<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.100> back<00:04:15.130> of<00:04:15.340> smokes<00:04:15.760> ring<00:04:15.970> which

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
plug it in the back of smokes ring which

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.270 
plug it in the back of smokes ring which
is<00:04:16.480> on<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.900> roof<00:04:17.080> of<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.350> vehicle<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.070> guess

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
is on the roof of the vehicle so I guess

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.580 
is on the roof of the vehicle so I guess
that<00:04:18.400> looks<00:04:18.549> pretty<00:04:18.670> cool<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that looks pretty cool the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
that looks pretty cool the

transformation back to racecar mode with
smokescreen<00:04:22.660> again<00:04:22.960> it's<00:04:23.410> fairly<00:04:23.770> tricky

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
smokescreen again it's fairly tricky

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.450
