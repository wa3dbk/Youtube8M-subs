okay<00:00:00.480> how<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:00.780> create<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.140> boot<00:00:01.380> disk<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.829> very

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay how to create a boot disk is very

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay how to create a boot disk is very
simple<00:00:03.120> you'd<00:00:03.360> go<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.720> website<00:00:03.959> called<00:00:04.170> boot

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
simple you'd go to a website called boot

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.829 
simple you'd go to a website called boot
disk<00:00:04.799> um<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:05.850> gives<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.180> lot<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.359> utilities

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
disk um it gives you a lot of utilities

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.020 
disk um it gives you a lot of utilities
that<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.990> would<00:00:07.170> use<00:00:07.319> for<00:00:07.950> say<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.250> USB<00:00:08.760> key

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
that you would use for say the USB key

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.660 
that you would use for say the USB key
or<00:00:09.450> if<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.260> even<00:00:10.349> if<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> old<00:00:11.400> self

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
or if you even if you have the old self

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
or if you even if you have the old self
floppy<00:00:11.910> drives<00:00:12.290> that'll<00:00:13.290> work<00:00:13.380> as<00:00:13.530> well

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
floppy drives that'll work as well

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880 
floppy drives that'll work as well
what's<00:00:14.690> not<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:15.960> well-known<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
what's not really well-known is that you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.939 
what's not really well-known is that you
can<00:00:17.039> use<00:00:17.369> any<00:00:17.760> type<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.090> USB<00:00:18.840> device<00:00:19.320> say<00:00:19.800> like

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
can use any type of USB device say like

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.240 
can use any type of USB device say like
a<00:00:19.980> portable<00:00:20.789> storage<00:00:21.090> drive<00:00:21.510> or<00:00:21.869> even<00:00:22.560> an<00:00:22.830> iPod

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
a portable storage drive or even an iPod

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
a portable storage drive or even an iPod
to<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> boot<00:00:25.260> disk<00:00:26.060> why<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.420> mean

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to make a boot disk why would you mean

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.419 
to make a boot disk why would you mean
to<00:00:27.960> make<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> boot<00:00:28.320> disk<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.220> good

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to make a boot disk is it's a very good

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.700 
to make a boot disk is it's a very good
question<00:00:30.230> generally<00:00:31.230> they're<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.410> really

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
question generally they're not really

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.000 
question generally they're not really
used<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.040> much<00:00:32.309> anymore<00:00:32.610> unless<00:00:33.180> you're<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
used that much anymore unless you're a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
used that much anymore unless you're a
computer<00:00:35.010> builder<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.899> does<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
computer builder what it does is it

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.049 
computer builder what it does is it
basically<00:00:37.530> creates<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:39.110> pre<00:00:40.280> OS<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.520> operating

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
basically creates a pre OS or operating

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
basically creates a pre OS or operating
system<00:00:42.090> environment<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.730> what<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
system environment and what does that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
system environment and what does that
mean<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.050> gives<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
mean to you well basically it gives you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
mean to you well basically it gives you
some<00:00:46.710> basic<00:00:47.100> commands<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.520> delete<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
some basic commands like delete and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.340 
some basic commands like delete and
format<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.210> partition<00:00:51.210> those<00:00:51.930> particular

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
format and partition those particular

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.760 
format and partition those particular
kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.239> essential<00:00:54.239> hard<00:00:54.809> drive<00:00:55.140> related

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
kind of essential hard drive related

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
kind of essential hard drive related
commands<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.629> need<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.899> entire

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
commands that you don't need an entire

commands that you don't need an entire
operating<00:00:58.469> system<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.239> instance<00:01:00.539> if

you wanted to access your hard drive

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
you wanted to access your hard drive
without<00:01:02.969> having<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.640> full-blown

to<00:01:28.080> step<00:01:28.320> through<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.310> generally<00:01:29.460> they're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to step through it but generally they're

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
to step through it but generally they're
they're<00:01:30.150> created<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:31.009> one<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> two

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
they're created through one of two

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
they're created through one of two
methods<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.470> utilities<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.650> posted<00:01:34.920> on

methods the utilities that are posted on
this<00:01:35.100> site<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.150> also<00:01:36.360> Windows<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
create boot disk function when you could

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
create boot disk function when you could
when<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> plug<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.729> any<00:01:41.939> medium<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:43.560> able

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
when you plug in any medium that is able

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120 
when you plug in any medium that is able
to<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.509> an<00:01:46.140> old<00:01:46.470> windows
