00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
prior to his last and I think he can

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720 
prior to his last and I think he can
improve<00:04:04.290> here<00:04:04.500> gets<00:04:04.890> Mike<00:04:05.130> Smith<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.520> board

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
improve here gets Mike Smith the board

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.360 
improve here gets Mike Smith the board
he's<00:04:06.690> training<00:04:07.080> went<00:04:07.230> out<00:04:07.290> for<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.560> he<00:04:08.160> gets

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
he's training went out for this he gets

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.860 
he's training went out for this he gets
that<00:04:08.490> added<00:04:08.850> distance<00:04:09.240> it<00:04:09.390> seems<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
that added distance it seems like the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.390 
that added distance it seems like the
longer<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> better<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.710> one<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:11.100> think

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
longer the better for this one I think

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.130 
longer the better for this one I think
it<00:04:11.460> can<00:04:11.580> sit<00:04:11.790> back<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.270> mid<00:04:12.450> pack<00:04:12.660> maybe<00:04:12.900> make

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
it can sit back and mid pack maybe make

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.020 
it can sit back and mid pack maybe make
a<00:04:13.170> decent<00:04:13.470> late<00:04:13.830> run<00:04:14.040> hit<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.490> board<00:04:14.820> at<00:04:14.970> a

a decent late run hit the board at a
good<00:04:15.240> price<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.470> how<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.590> suggest

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
