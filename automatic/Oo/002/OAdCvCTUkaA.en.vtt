 with electroshock for tijuana if I have 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.000

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.309
 with a big weight wrestler and 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.129
 strong in tijuana on September 7 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 of a mask fight against hair 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 an important fight and of course that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 you have many rivals in all the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.990
 republic unmasks until pierrot one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.700
 of the most important that has been in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.079
 your career there is another one that is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.179
 important with saying it's the black one 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.159
 tiger but do not remove the finger from the line 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.640
 and you want to end the race of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.659
 doctor wagner if i need and urge me is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.950
 something like a way of life that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.360
 I need to continue living because if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.759
 he did not remove the mask I'm playing 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.829
 I'm playing, I'm getting used to 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.020
 only then do I need that mask to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.209
 to live and do the things 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 pity that a fighter so big and so 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.170
 Good as Dr. Werner does not accept 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.330
 a fight against me from mask against 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.799
 mask a fight that a lot of people 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.720
 I would like to see at any time in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.039
 any arena is a total and for 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 Of course you are willing to 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.330
 face it under any circumstance 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.549
 I have always been willing to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.950
 face it here in china where you like it 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.990
 pity that he always runs me and this 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 fight if it's going to be once in Monterrey and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 then I continue to do in tijuana at the time of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.039
 sign contracts the lord does not want 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.170
 good your reasons will have but here you 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.010
 I will continue with my finger in the line until 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.220
 do not accuse him and he ends 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.019
 to pose your mask you have many years 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.239
 of career you have already 15 years of career 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.870
 He is a very complete and ekiza fighter 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.909
 ask you adolfo tapia because a lot 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.980
 holy people because of fighter functions 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.200
 chew decides to give his real name 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.360
 because I'm already tired of so many people 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.329
 that is inviting me from so many people 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
 he puts on a team and makes believe that 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.420
 It's me 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 there are many invitations and friends that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.409
 cheat the public I never cheated 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.970
 has never tried to cheat them and a lot 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.980
 least he loaned me for being cheated 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.690
 now I have to put on my 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 name that's why it's about 'my 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.579
 real name my real name is adolfo 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.440
 tapia the authentic and original the grim 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.450
 the grim reaper and even if you changed the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.720
 design of this good mask 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.060
 now you told me a while ago adolfo no 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 you said that you had changed the design of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.730
 the mask and that this drawing you 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.459
 did you do all the costume and all the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560
 mask and also the other one's bones 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.450
 and all I did and this also what 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.579
 I did little by little I'm inventing 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.700
 I put one thing I take something else out 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.489
 that perfected it and remains 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.110
 the bones did not make you you have 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.170
 made the bones team more 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.030
 important I have always said to me the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 bones they did not do to me I did to the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.349
 bones and I can not remove the bones 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 when I want and - I put back and not 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.800
 nothing happens in another character 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.930
 that has triple 'a' if he removes it 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.940
 the bones that will happen easy being 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.910
 a donnadie because before being the grim 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.330
 he had three four or five teams and not 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.160
 was nobody then here the only flaw 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.290
 that the authentic and original I always go 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.989
 to be me and while I live and exist 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.730
 it's always going to be a copy and I repeat 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.650
 I made the bones, not the bones, 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.079
 they did to me and to him if they did 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.150
 bones and if I take my bones away I 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.530
 I will continue to be the part here in China and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.049
 him if he took them off is going to happen 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.489
 I just want to know what will happen 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.730
 you have a commitment also in the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.860
 Coahuila border city very soon 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.480
 speak of drying angular there is a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.569
 quadrangular that is going to be in frontier 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.430
 coahuila where is the doctor wainer in 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.320
 one corner last warrior in another 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.880
 corner and here since they bring a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 very strong rivalry 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.330
 and then be in another corner and in the 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.760
 another corner will be blue panther 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.990
 let's do 4 all against all and at 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.000
 final only has to see a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.030
 triumphant then the winner and see no 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.830
 finally to go finishing it's brand 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.420
 tell us your goals only 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.640
 we talked about many things since they are 15 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.130
 years of success career of suffering 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.470
 also of good things others not so much 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.720
 but of all learned and what is the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.640
 lesson of this career throughout 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.070
 these years realization of this race 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.980
 has the good and the bad the good is that 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.900
 the public has accepted me wants me 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.910
 has given wrestling to buy me 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.980
 Casita has given me the wrestling to 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.440
 to take my children to pay them a 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.120
 good study and how bad that when 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.120
 someone is triumphing and going towards 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.770
 ahead there are no missing copies and 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.210
 copies are the ones that have been 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.190
 affecting in various parts of the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.890
 Mexican Republic because apart from that 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.670
 they do not know how to fight they are made and they believe that 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.460
 are the originals 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.050
 Well many times all over me 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.820
 liked the way how to report up to 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.730
 you can see the report and 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.580
 I send the pulse as sports 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.090
 they say and to finish their friend reporter 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.860
 adolfo tapia the grim reaper and another cut 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.860
 thank you we go back to the studio
