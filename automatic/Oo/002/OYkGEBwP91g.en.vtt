00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so I just wanted to do a quick overview

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.829 
so I just wanted to do a quick overview
of<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.730> new<00:00:03.060> Lenovo<00:00:03.600> 2014<00:00:04.410> t<00:00:04.859> 440<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
of the new Lenovo 2014 t 440 this is a

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.299 
of the new Lenovo 2014 t 440 this is a
big<00:00:07.259> new<00:00:07.410> redesign<00:00:07.950> from<00:00:08.189> Lenovo<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> I

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
big new redesign from Lenovo and so I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.530 
big new redesign from Lenovo and so I
guess<00:00:11.460> let's<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.670> start<00:00:11.969> from<00:00:12.090> some<00:00:12.269> basic

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
guess let's just start from some basic

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.570 
guess let's just start from some basic
things<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.920> x1<00:00:14.309> carbon

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
things just like on the x1 carbon

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.090 
things just like on the x1 carbon
overview<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.350> absolutely<00:00:16.350> hate<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.859> new

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
overview I absolutely hate this new

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
overview I absolutely hate this new
Lenovo<00:00:17.640> touchpad<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.080> there's<00:00:19.320> no<00:00:19.500> buttons

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
Lenovo touchpad and there's no buttons

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.230 
Lenovo touchpad and there's no buttons
at<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.880> presses<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.539> makes<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> pointer

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
at the presses which makes the pointer

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000 
at the presses which makes the pointer
move<00:00:24.510> easily<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.289> while<00:00:25.650> you're<00:00:25.830> clicking

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
move easily if while you're clicking

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.370 
move easily if while you're clicking
there's<00:00:26.789> no<00:00:26.970> buttons<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> TrackPoint

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
there's no buttons for the TrackPoint

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740 
there's no buttons for the TrackPoint
but<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.340> least<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.150> still<00:00:30.480> kept

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
but at least on this one they still kept

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
but at least on this one they still kept
the<00:00:30.900> F<00:00:31.019> keys<00:00:31.260> although<00:00:31.590> by<00:00:31.740> default<00:00:32.279> they

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the F keys although by default they

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
the F keys although by default they
actually<00:00:33.090> control<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> brightness<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
actually control the brightness so you

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.470 
actually control the brightness so you
need<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> hold<00:00:35.160> function<00:00:35.430> understand<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
need to hold function understand you can

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
need to hold function understand you can
change<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> settings<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.520> are

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
change this in the settings so they are

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510 
change this in the settings so they are
the<00:00:38.940> F<00:00:39.180> keys<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.719> default<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.559> guess<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the F keys by default which I guess is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
the F keys by default which I guess is
okay<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.210> least<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.600> f<00:00:42.809> keys<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
okay because at least our f keys that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.299 
okay because at least our f keys that
aren't<00:00:44.129> touchscreen<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.420> x1<00:00:45.750> carbon

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
aren't touchscreen like on the x1 carbon

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
aren't touchscreen like on the x1 carbon
so<00:00:47.309> overall<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.390> computer<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.590> pretty

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so overall this computer it's pretty

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.270 
so overall this computer it's pretty
nice

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
nice

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.010 
nice
keyboard<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.149> always<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
keyboard as good as always and we have a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.139 
keyboard as good as always and we have a
USB<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.260> mini<00:00:55.920> DisplayPort<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.260> on<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.800> side

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
USB a mini DisplayPort and on this side

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.899 
USB a mini DisplayPort and on this side
we<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:01.219> Ethernet<00:01:02.219> VGA<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:04.080> USB<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.790> it's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
we have a Ethernet VGA and a USB so it's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
we have a Ethernet VGA and a USB so it's
a<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.210> bad<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:07.020> USBs<00:01:07.530> as

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a little too bad there are two USBs as

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
a little too bad there are two USBs as
well<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> x1<00:01:08.820> carbon<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.299> feel

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
well just like on the x1 carbon I feel

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.859 
well just like on the x1 carbon I feel
like<00:01:09.869> 480<00:01:10.200> series<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.659> kind<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
like 480 series which is a kind of a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
like 480 series which is a kind of a
slightly<00:01:13.229> bigger<00:01:13.530> laptop<00:01:13.740> from<00:01:14.250> Lenovo<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
slightly bigger laptop from Lenovo that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.109 
slightly bigger laptop from Lenovo that
it<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.780> should<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.229> least<00:01:16.259> three<00:01:17.119> at

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it really should have at least three at

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.880 
it really should have at least three at
least<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> Ethernet<00:01:19.049> jack<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.470> course<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
least as the Ethernet jack of course but

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.170 
least as the Ethernet jack of course but
forty<00:01:20.250> series<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.790> would<00:01:20.909> pretty<00:01:21.090> much

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
forty series that we would pretty much

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.679 
forty series that we would pretty much
have<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.060> guess<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.299> other<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
have to so I guess one other thing I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.240 
have to so I guess one other thing I
meant<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.110> forgot<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> mention<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> x1

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
meant I forgot to mention on the x1

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
meant I forgot to mention on the x1
carbon<00:01:26.460> review<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.909> I'm<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> big<00:01:27.659> fan<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
carbon review is I'm not a big fan of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
carbon review is I'm not a big fan of
the<00:01:28.259> new<00:01:28.290> Lenovo<00:01:28.890> powered<00:01:29.250> Jack<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the new Lenovo powered Jack it's a it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
the new Lenovo powered Jack it's a it
fits<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:30.930> tightly<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
fits in there really tightly in it and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
fits in there really tightly in it and
it<00:01:32.189> feels<00:01:32.369> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> tripped

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
it feels kind of like if you tripped

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
it feels kind of like if you tripped
over<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.140> power<00:01:34.470> cord<00:01:34.880> focus<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.060> bit

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
over your power cord focus a little bit

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
over your power cord focus a little bit
if<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> tripped<00:01:37.140> over<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:37.380> power<00:01:37.680> cord<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
if you tripped over your power cord the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
if you tripped over your power cord the
computer<00:01:38.400> would<00:01:38.520> absolutely<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.360> flying<00:01:39.659> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
computer would absolutely go flying up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
computer would absolutely go flying up
the<00:01:39.990> table<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> old<00:01:40.979> Jack's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the table and the way the old Jack's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
the table and the way the old Jack's
were<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.079> plugged<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
were where it just kind of plugged in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
were where it just kind of plugged in
lightly<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> trip<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.090> your

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
lightly so if you were to trip over your

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.520 
lightly so if you were to trip over your
power<00:01:45.450> cord<00:01:45.720> there's<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:46.170> chance<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
power cord there's a good chance that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
power cord there's a good chance that
the<00:01:46.680> power<00:01:46.860> cord<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.430> fly<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the power cord would just fly out of the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
the power cord would just fly out of the
laptop<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.229> still<00:01:49.470> stay<00:01:49.649> there<00:01:49.799> on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
laptop and it would still stay there on

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
laptop and it would still stay there on
the<00:01:49.979> table<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.689> kind<00:01:51.869> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the table but now it really kind of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
the table but now it really kind of
plugs<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.439> tightly<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
plugs in there tightly and I don't like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
plugs in there tightly and I don't like
that<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> doesn't<00:01:55.110> need<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> tight<00:01:55.890> or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that I doesn't need to be that tight or

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
that I doesn't need to be that tight or
kind<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> square<00:01:57.000> connector<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
kind of like a square connector I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
kind of like a square connector I
preferred<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> round<00:01:59.070> shaped<00:01:59.369> connector

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
preferred the round shaped connector

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.310 
preferred the round shaped connector
more<00:02:00.500> another<00:02:01.500> thing<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.130> screen<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:03.320> not

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
more another thing is the screen is not

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
more another thing is the screen is not
good<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> x1<00:02:05.790> carbon<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.210> feel<00:02:06.360> like

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
good and on the x1 carbon I feel like

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
good and on the x1 carbon I feel like
it's<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> little<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:06.930> excusable<00:02:07.409> since<00:02:07.740> it's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it's a little more excusable since it's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's a little more excusable since it's
a<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.250> portable<00:02:08.729> computer<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.869> is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
a very portable computer but this is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.290 
a very portable computer but this is
and<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.670> feel<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> screen<00:02:13.180> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and I just feel like the screen is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.660 
and I just feel like the screen is
pretty<00:02:13.660> bad<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.410> feels<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> really

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
pretty bad it just feels like a really

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.610 
pretty bad it just feels like a really
budget<00:02:16.270> screen<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.780> there's<00:02:17.020> nothing<00:02:17.230> really

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
budget screen is there's nothing really

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.590 
budget screen is there's nothing really
to<00:02:17.710> like<00:02:17.860> about<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> that's<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:20.080> okay<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.600> it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
to like about it that's it's okay but it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.480 
to like about it that's it's okay but it
just<00:02:22.750> looks<00:02:22.990> pixelated<00:02:23.560> things<00:02:23.770> look<00:02:24.100> kind<00:02:24.430> of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
just looks pixelated things look kind of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.920 
just looks pixelated things look kind of
blocky<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:30.310> camera<00:02:30.670> but<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.900> a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
blocky see just camera but it's not a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.250 
blocky see just camera but it's not a
good<00:02:32.110> screen<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.880> I'm<00:02:34.090> also<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.900> new

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
good screen so and I'm also the new

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.890 
good screen so and I'm also the new
design<00:02:35.710> it's<00:02:36.130> I'm<00:02:37.090> not<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.330> biggest<00:02:37.510> fan<00:02:37.630> its

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
design it's I'm not the biggest fan its

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.480 
design it's I'm not the biggest fan its
really<00:02:38.290> simple<00:02:38.470> obviously<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.190> there's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
really simple obviously so there's

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.860 
really simple obviously so there's
there's<00:02:39.790> not<00:02:39.970> really<00:02:40.120> much<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.690> kind

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
there's not really much to it it's kind

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.400 
there's not really much to it it's kind
of<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.500> very<00:02:41.560> square<00:02:42.250> shaped<00:02:42.690> which<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.050> wish

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
of just very square shaped which I wish

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.920 
of just very square shaped which I wish
was<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.740> something<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.220> little<00:02:45.400> more<00:02:45.930> more

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
was just something a little more more

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.850 
was just something a little more more
interesting<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.560> things<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.800> don't

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
interesting to it and things I don't

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.610 
interesting to it and things I don't
like<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.340> example<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:48.910> along<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.300> edge

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
like is for example here along the edge

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.070 
like is for example here along the edge
it's<00:02:50.620> kind<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.150> rough<00:02:52.150> little<00:02:52.600> rough<00:02:52.840> word

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
it's kind of a rough little rough word

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it's kind of a rough little rough word

where it meets the two by six meet right
hand<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.910> kind<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.300> give<00:02:58.450> that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660

fisher-price feeling to it to keep to
going<00:03:01.090> out<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.270> focus<00:03:01.390> Arizona<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.700> just

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
going out of focus Arizona so it just

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.490 
going out of focus Arizona so it just
it's<00:03:04.150> kind<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.330> all<00:03:04.480> around<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> laptop<00:03:05.320> when

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
it's kind of all around the laptop when

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.160 
it's kind of all around the laptop when
you<00:03:05.530> move<00:03:06.160> your<00:03:06.340> finger<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.959> kind<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.020> has

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you move your finger it just kind of has

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.750 
you move your finger it just kind of has
a<00:03:08.220> cheap<00:03:09.220> plastic<00:03:09.690> device<00:03:10.690> feel<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
a cheap plastic device feel to it and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.580 
a cheap plastic device feel to it and
I'm<00:03:12.760> not<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.970> big<00:03:13.150> fan<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.470> mean

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
I'm not a big fan of that so I mean

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.960 
I'm not a big fan of that so I mean
overall<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:14.980> computer<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.430> good<00:03:15.580> I'd<00:03:15.730> really

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
overall this computer is good I'd really

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.610 
overall this computer is good I'd really
like<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.239> have<00:03:16.510> three<00:03:16.959> USB<00:03:17.260> ports<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:23.320> three

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
like it to have three USB ports so three

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.140 
like it to have three USB ports so three
USB<00:03:23.830> ports<00:03:23.950> you're<00:03:24.280> gonna<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.580> have<00:03:24.670> HDMI

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
USB ports you're gonna have to have HDMI

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.479 
USB ports you're gonna have to have HDMI
and<00:03:25.180> x1<00:03:25.900> carbon<00:03:26.080> has<00:03:26.350> HDMI<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.040> guess<00:03:27.250> in

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
and x1 carbon has HDMI but I guess in

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.699 
and x1 carbon has HDMI but I guess in
display<00:03:27.820> board<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.360> okay<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:29.230> long<00:03:29.320> as<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.590> has

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
display board is okay as long as it has

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.380 
display board is okay as long as it has
BGA<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.100> DisplayPort<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:32.730> yeah<00:03:33.790> honestly

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
BGA and DisplayPort and on yeah honestly

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.110 
BGA and DisplayPort and on yeah honestly
I<00:03:34.480> would<00:03:34.750> probably<00:03:35.019> recommend<00:03:35.440> just<00:03:36.120> skipping

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
I would probably recommend just skipping

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.870 
I would probably recommend just skipping
lenovo<00:03:37.750> until<00:03:38.260> maybe<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.250> second<00:03:39.580> iteration

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
lenovo until maybe the second iteration

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.370 
lenovo until maybe the second iteration
of<00:03:40.090> their<00:03:40.239> indie<00:03:40.390> design<00:03:40.720> because<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.170> is

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
of their indie design because this is

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.590 
of their indie design because this is
just<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:43.750> feels<00:03:43.900> too<00:03:44.290> new<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.830> i<00:03:45.540> don't<00:03:46.540> know

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
just it feels too new and i don't know
