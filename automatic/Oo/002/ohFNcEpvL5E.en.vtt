it's had a paint job

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
it's had a paint job
but<00:00:31.920> you'd<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.160> forgiven<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.610> thinking

but you'd be forgiven for thinking

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
but you'd be forgiven for thinking
that's<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that's all it can do so I'm going to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.240 
that's all it can do so I'm going to
show<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.399> five<00:00:35.730> ways<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> n95<00:00:37.380> 8<00:00:37.770> gig<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
show you five ways that the n95 8 gig is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.639 
show you five ways that the n95 8 gig is
more<00:00:38.489> than<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.969> bigger<00:00:39.149> memory<00:00:39.649> firstly

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
more than just a bigger memory firstly

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
more than just a bigger memory firstly
as<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> forum<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.870> pretty<00:00:43.079> much<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> same

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
as the forum it's pretty much the same

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.760 
as the forum it's pretty much the same
size<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> n95<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> hell<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
size as in the n95 but it's the hell of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
size as in the n95 but it's the hell of
a<00:00:46.829> lot<00:00:47.010> lighter<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> multimedia<00:00:48.510> buttons

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a lot lighter on the multimedia buttons

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
a lot lighter on the multimedia buttons
here<00:00:49.110> they're<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> bit<00:00:50.219> more<00:00:50.370> rounded<00:00:50.850> which

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
here they're a bit more rounded which

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670 
here they're a bit more rounded which
makes<00:00:51.329> groping<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.809> music<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> dark<00:00:52.559> a

makes groping for music in the dark a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.880 
makes groping for music in the dark a
lot<00:00:52.770> easier<00:00:53.300> performance<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.620> RAM

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lot easier performance is up to more RAM

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
lot easier performance is up to more RAM
means<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.910> running<00:00:57.539> applications<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.230> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
got a longer battery life so you don't

on<00:01:42.630> every<00:01:42.960> handset<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
on every handset which is nice so it's a

much more powerful machine which makes

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
much more powerful machine which makes
it<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.390> complete<00:01:48.750> machine<00:01:49.020> the

it a much more complete machine the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.399 
it a much more complete machine the
