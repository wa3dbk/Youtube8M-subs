00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.970 
got air conditioning up there which it
all<00:03:37.920> functions<00:03:38.639> but<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:40.319> doesn't<00:03:40.650> blow<00:03:40.799> out

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
all functions but it doesn't blow out

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.589 
all functions but it doesn't blow out
cold<00:03:41.280> air<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:41.790> I'm<00:03:41.940> guessing<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.540> that

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
cold air so I'm guessing that that

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.710 
cold air so I'm guessing that that
probably<00:03:43.049> would<00:03:43.290> need<00:03:43.470> me<00:03:43.739> gassing<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:48.000> take

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
probably would need me gassing so take

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.190 
probably would need me gassing so take
you<00:03:48.900> around<00:03:49.139> again<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:49.799> another<00:03:50.190> look
