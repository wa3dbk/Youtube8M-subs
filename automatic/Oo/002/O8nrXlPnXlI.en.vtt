these balls and you go on to them and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.350 
these balls and you go on to them and
you<00:01:18.890> come<00:01:19.160> back<00:01:19.190> up<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.640> cause<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.060> sing

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.140 
you come back up and cause you to sing
this<00:01:20.780> takes<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.140> lot<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.320> practice<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:21.890> time<00:01:22.150> you

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
this takes a lot of practice in time you

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.490 
this takes a lot of practice in time you
might<00:01:23.480> be<00:01:23.510> at<00:01:23.720> lucky<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.110> get<00:01:24.260> within<00:01:24.410> a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
might be at lucky and get within a

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.160 
might be at lucky and get within a
couple<00:01:24.740> times<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.100> find<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.370> easier<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.729> to

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
couple times I find it easier just to

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.110 
couple times I find it easier just to
kind<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:27.620> go<00:01:28.280> for<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.550> just<00:01:28.670> like

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
kind of like just go for it just like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.110 
kind of like just go for it just like
the<00:01:29.270> controller<00:01:29.570> go<00:01:29.780> loose<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:31.670> dive<00:01:31.850> Oh

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
the controller go loose just dive Oh

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.030 
the controller go loose just dive Oh
what<00:01:32.720> else<00:01:32.810> close<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:36.050> also<00:01:36.200> might<00:01:36.560> sometimes

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
what else close it also might sometimes

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.820 
what else close it also might sometimes
be<00:01:37.160> easier<00:01:37.340> if<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.259> like<00:01:39.290> that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
be easier if you just do it like that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.770 
be easier if you just do it like that
and<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.580> will<00:01:40.790> eventually<00:01:41.030> lead<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.600> you

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
and this will eventually lead to you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.780 
and this will eventually lead to you
going<00:01:42.740> underneath<00:01:43.009> them<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.640> will<00:01:43.759> throw

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
going underneath them and it will throw

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.359 
going underneath them and it will throw
you<00:01:44.150> right<00:01:44.450> down<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.930> bottom<00:01:45.070> all<00:01:46.070> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
you right down to the bottom all you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.680 
you right down to the bottom all you
really<00:01:46.460> need<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.820> deep<00:01:47.030> enough<00:01:47.210> pool<00:01:47.479> which

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
really need is a deep enough pool which

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.180 
really need is a deep enough pool which
is<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.350> only<00:01:48.470> pool<00:01:48.800> in<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.009> game

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
is this is the only pool in the game

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.260 
is this is the only pool in the game
really<00:01:50.440> nice<00:01:51.440> old<00:01:51.680> balls<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.670> dive<00:01:52.970> down

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
really nice old balls and you dive down

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.230 
really nice old balls and you dive down
and<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:54.500> should<00:01:54.670> shoot<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.790> down<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
and it should shoot you down to the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
bottom takes a lot of practice in time

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.690 
bottom takes a lot of practice in time
it's<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.410> lot<00:02:00.560> fun<00:02:00.770> down<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.190> actually<00:02:01.520> gets
