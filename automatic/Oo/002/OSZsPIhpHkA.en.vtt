00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.830
 imagine life without color sometimes not 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.340
 suspected the existence of such a disease 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.650
 I was six or seven years old and maybe I 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.690
 lacked intelligence 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 to say yes I didn’t know and don’t 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.619
 I told my parents about it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.350
 you need to draw that is not able to see 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.349
 how my kids mix colors and what they 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.939
 imagine 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.380
 it's not that I can't name them 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 there is simply nothing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.710
 this gray that gray and this gray more 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 300 million people in the world of color blindness 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 there were moments when other girls and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 laughed at me like I couldn't 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 distinguish between different shades of colors and i 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 felt awkward 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.719
 sometimes it seems to me that the world is full of colors 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 and I'm just passing by the shaft sport paint 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 believes that everyone should 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 enjoy the colors of this world organism 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.680
 This is the case when the eyes are different from 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 an ordinary person's eyes are color blind 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.840
 the world is not like the rest in this case 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.500
 usually green red look 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 equally so if existed 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.439
 some color filter or glasses that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.180
 would share colors it would help a lot 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.420
 first not receiving signals 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.119
 the problem is in the eye photo affair 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.670
 pigments you bar works on enchroma 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.770
 to give color to each we developed 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 glasses so people suffering from this disease 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.090
 were able to see the color for the first time 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.810
 you just look 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.759
 in gas a whole range of different colors 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.990
 which I previously could not even imagine 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.460
 I had a fog before my eyes 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 it's amazing 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.149
 I have never seen this color here to me 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 i even want to cry i don't even 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 represented how much I can't 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.730
 all see the world as others see it 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 people in the world 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 when he draws i see him get out 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.510
 boxes of colored pencils then puts 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.610
 them back and so again and again now i'm 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.870
 I see all these colors and I understand why he 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.560
 it did these things so not by chance 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.730
 and living 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.730
 I did not realize it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.700
 then the ends color perception is something 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.510
 very personal and very difficult 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 explain to someone 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.780
 and you see it every day before 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.430
 I began to dim and almost all 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.500
 I do not want to shoot 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.860
 she's so boring to be honest 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.540
 I did not attach importance to the fact that I suffer 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.020
 color blind it was just with me I 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.670
 handled it was not a big problem 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.920
 but to be able to see colors is just 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.640
 amazing and i think everyone should 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.640
 be able to do this by translating John’s voice
