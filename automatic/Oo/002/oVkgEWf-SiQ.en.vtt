00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.359
 rodrigues today I'm going to present a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 selection with four cool app 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 a big hug the first app

 It will help you a lot when you need it.

 access certain features without 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.530
 need to leave the page you are 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 it will also help you when you 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.239
 need to quickly access the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430
 specific functionality like 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.539
 calculator the calendar 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.899
 This is the proposal of the multitester ep with 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.070
 only a gesture that can be configured 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:09.290
 if the trigger flap with various options 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 calendar camera gallery calculator 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.860
 music player map and follows relation 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.330
 just click on the desired option that a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 window will appear 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.000
 The cool thing is that you can resize the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.759
 size of the window drag it to where 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 want and even open another window that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.409
 will overlap on the version you paid for 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.729
 have access to apps like youtube sms 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 gmail and flashlight 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.920
 The second suggestion is a very 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.930
 Nice but with a peculiarity. 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 I recommend to those people who 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.270
 do not use the flow function 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 or just the same key I realized that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.320
 a lot of people 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 use the original keyboard of the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.020
 smartphone that is not usually legal 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.810
 well it's clear it offers interface 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.030
 cool that lets you type with 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.030
 greater accuracy 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.300
 some tips are needed however 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.700
 After installing you need to go in 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.020

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.660
 Portuguese 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.290
 for now is to choose Portugal 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.569
 language which start using starts 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 a small tutorial that the only one 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.350
 inconvenience is being in English but it is 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.600

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.540
 some tasks are necessary to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.959
