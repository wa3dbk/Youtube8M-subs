to<00:01:10.590> android<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> price<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.540> just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to android is the price if we just

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
to android is the price if we just
compare<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.170> specs<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> iphone<00:01:14.310> and

already notice it's a difference the
cost<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> completely<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> same<00:01:20.070> but

cost is completely the same but

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.640 
cost is completely the same but
performance<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.450> worse<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.020> iphone<00:01:22.350> 5
