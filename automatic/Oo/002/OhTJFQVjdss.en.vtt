00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.879 
but then again this whole game and its
atmosphere<00:05:29.510> doesn't<00:05:29.990> really<00:05:30.200> fit<00:05:30.410> with<00:05:30.530> Sonic

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
atmosphere doesn't really fit with Sonic

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.690 
atmosphere doesn't really fit with Sonic
