second I felt like he was out there a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.200 
second I felt like he was out there a
little<00:02:11.800> bit<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.190> as<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.490> race<00:02:12.610> went<00:02:12.820> on<00:02:13.030> he

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
little bit and as the race went on he

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.360 
little bit and as the race went on he
was<00:02:13.390> getting<00:02:13.600> closer<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.990> closer<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.650> there

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
was getting closer and closer but there

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.740 
was getting closer and closer but there
are<00:02:15.460> some<00:02:15.610> lap<00:02:15.760> cars<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.210> kind<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.420> got<00:02:16.540> held

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
are some lap cars that kind of got held

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
up with and you know I thought at times

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.000 
up with and you know I thought at times
he<00:02:19.240> did<00:02:19.390> was<00:02:19.960> doing<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.260> same<00:02:20.470> he<00:02:20.620> kind<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.860> got

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
he did was doing the same he kind of got

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.350 
he did was doing the same he kind of got
you<00:02:21.190> know<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> wasn't<00:02:21.700> getting<00:02:21.940> through<00:02:22.150> them

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you know it wasn't getting through them

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.690 
you know it wasn't getting through them
as<00:02:22.450> good<00:02:22.600> at<00:02:22.810> times<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:24.400> end<00:02:24.520> there<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
as good at times but the end there I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.250 
as good at times but the end there I
thought<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.940> definitely<00:02:25.390> had<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> chance<00:02:25.810> you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
thought I definitely had a chance you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.080 
thought I definitely had a chance you
know<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.410> saw<00:02:26.950> him<00:02:27.040> almost<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> infield<00:02:27.910> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
know I saw him almost in the infield and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.630 
know I saw him almost in the infield and
a<00:02:28.300> lot<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.570> dust<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.370> didn't<00:02:30.550> get

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
a lot of dust but we just didn't get

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.810 
a lot of dust but we just didn't get
close<00:02:30.850> enough<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
close enough you know this is it's a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.270

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.690 
actually Brad sweet was in there a
little<00:02:41.260> bit<00:02:41.410> mixing<00:02:41.800> up<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> had<00:02:42.580> an

little bit mixing up and you had an

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.490 
little bit mixing up and you had an
incredible<00:02:43.300> run<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> top<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.140> cushion

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500

incredible run on the top of the cushion
do<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.190> your<00:02:45.280> car<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.580> better<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
do you think your car was better on the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.730 
do you think your car was better on the
top<00:02:46.210> or<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.360> bottom<00:02:46.420> tonight<00:02:46.900> well<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.650> just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
top or the bottom tonight well it's just

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.620 
top or the bottom tonight well it's just
it's<00:02:48.100> it's<00:02:48.370> hard<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.760> say<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.240> was<00:02:49.390> tricky

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
it's it's hard to say like it was tricky

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.390 
it's it's hard to say like it was tricky
to<00:02:49.810> round<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.020> bottom<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.710> me<00:02:50.830> I'm<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.190> little

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
to round the bottom for me I'm a little

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.680 
to round the bottom for me I'm a little
too<00:02:51.550> tight<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.880> run<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> bottom<00:02:52.210> was<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> little

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
too tight to run the bottom was a little

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
too tight to run the bottom was a little
easier<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.020> run<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> top<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.220> top<00:02:54.460> was<00:02:54.640> in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
easier to run the top but the top was in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.700 
easier to run the top but the top was in
the<00:02:54.820> fast<00:02:55.030> line<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.230> really<00:02:56.500> had<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.650> have

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
the fast line so you really had to have

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.430 
the fast line so you really had to have
lap<00:02:56.950> cars<00:02:57.250> or<00:02:57.520> lap<00:02:57.700> traffic<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:58.990> playing

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
lap cars or lap traffic you know playing

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.229 
lap cars or lap traffic you know playing
out<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.830> where<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.460> dirty<00:03:00.700> air<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.150> me

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
out to where you have dirty air for me

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.070 
out to where you have dirty air for me
to<00:03:01.360> have<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:02.830> good<00:03:03.520> clean<00:03:03.730> line<00:03:04.330> on<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.630> top<00:03:04.810> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
to have a good clean line on the top and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.470 
to have a good clean line on the top and
not<00:03:05.320> lose<00:03:05.500> time<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:07.000> was<00:03:07.150> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
not lose time so it was kind of a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.240 
not lose time so it was kind of a
catch-22<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:08.290> us<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:08.800> we<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.100> lap

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
catch-22 for us but when we got in lap

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.220 
catch-22 for us but when we got in lap
traffic<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.850> definitely<00:03:10.209> helped<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.690> could<00:03:11.110> get

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
traffic it definitely helped I could get

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.390 
traffic it definitely helped I could get
through<00:03:11.410> three<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.680> four<00:03:11.739> really<00:03:12.070> good<00:03:12.250> on

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
through three and four really good on

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880 
through three and four really good on
the<00:03:12.489> top<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.320> never<00:03:14.470> got<00:03:14.590> close

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the top but I just never got close

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.110 
the top but I just never got close
enough<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.400> Donnie<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.820> know<00:03:15.940> he's

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.660 
need to improve on anything it's Traxxas
size<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.350> know<00:03:56.380> as<00:03:56.980> wet<00:03:57.190> as<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.370> one<00:03:57.550> was

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
size and you know as wet as this one was

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.940 
size and you know as wet as this one was
so<00:03:57.970> we<00:03:58.720> had<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.840> good<00:03:58.989> car<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.410> guys<00:03:59.560> did<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.800> good

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
so we had a good car my guys did a good

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.430 
so we had a good car my guys did a good
job<00:04:00.010> we<00:04:00.760> came<00:04:00.940> back<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.570> really<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.350> think

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
job we came back and really I think

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.370 
job we came back and really I think
rebounded<00:04:03.070> from<00:04:03.250> here<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.640> spring<00:04:03.910> but

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
rebounded from here in the spring but

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.240 
rebounded from here in the spring but
like<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.410> said<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.680> same<00:04:05.830> time<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.040> star<00:04:06.160> on

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
like I said you same time you star on

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.809 
like I said you same time you star on
the<00:04:06.340> front<00:04:06.520> row<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> get<00:04:06.880> beat<00:04:07.440> isn't<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.500> lot<00:04:08.590> of

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
the front row to get beat isn't a lot of

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.910 
the front row to get beat isn't a lot of
and<00:04:09.030> do<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.900> beat<00:04:10.079> as<00:04:10.200> bad<00:04:10.349> as<00:04:10.469> we<00:04:10.560> did<00:04:10.739> it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
and do you beat as bad as we did it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.830 
and do you beat as bad as we did it
makes<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.519> even<00:04:11.579> harder<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:12.060> good<00:04:12.629> run<00:04:12.810> for

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
makes it even harder but good run for

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.530 
makes it even harder but good run for
KKR<00:04:13.379> in<00:04:13.590> second<00:04:13.920> third<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.069> fourth<00:04:14.370> I've<00:04:15.299> been

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
good if just one for the guy won but

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.520 
good if just one for the guy won but

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.629 
that again
were<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.020> expecting<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.560> track<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.039> stay<00:04:26.490> as

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
were you expecting the track to stay as

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.170 
were you expecting the track to stay as
wet<00:04:26.850> as<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.120> did<00:04:27.240> all<00:04:27.360> night<00:04:27.570> no<00:04:28.380> but<00:04:28.710> honestly

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
wet as it did all night no but honestly

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.330 
wet as it did all night no but honestly
probably<00:04:30.180> happy<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:30.630> did<00:04:30.840> because<00:04:31.259> this<00:04:32.130> place

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
probably happy it did because this place

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.249 
probably happy it did because this place
gets<00:04:32.580> really<00:04:32.850> leji<00:04:33.150> up<00:04:33.270> closer<00:04:33.870> going<00:04:34.110> over

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
gets really leji up closer going over

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.170 
gets really leji up closer going over
the<00:04:34.350> edge<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.740> even<00:04:35.340> goes<00:04:35.550> more<00:04:35.789> against<00:04:36.090> my

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
the edge it even goes more against my

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.570 
the edge it even goes more against my
favor<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:36.830> obviously<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.949> track<00:04:38.130> was<00:04:38.280> good<00:04:38.460> it

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
favor so obviously the track was good it

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
favor so obviously the track was good it
was<00:04:38.669> really<00:04:38.850> wet<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> was<00:04:39.180> really<00:04:39.360> surprised

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
was really wet I was really surprised

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.620 
was really wet I was really surprised
about<00:04:39.750> 40<00:04:40.050> laps<00:04:40.169> green<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> checkered<00:04:41.419> but<00:04:42.419> I

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
about 40 laps green a checkered but I

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.180 
about 40 laps green a checkered but I
could<00:04:42.900> move<00:04:43.020> around<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.500> didn't<00:04:43.919> find<00:04:44.039> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
could move around I just didn't find the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.610 
could move around I just didn't find the
track<00:04:44.400> early<00:04:44.699> enough<00:04:45.110> kind<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.169> came<00:04:46.320> back<00:04:46.349> to

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
track early enough kind of came back to

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.930 
track early enough kind of came back to
Cody<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.919> little<00:04:47.099> bit<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.280> think<00:04:47.490> he<00:04:47.550> got<00:04:47.639> held<00:04:47.849> up

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
Cody a little bit I think he got held up

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.719

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
was better than we finished so as a

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.710 
was better than we finished so as a
driver<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.669> hard<00:04:53.820> part<00:04:54.060> but<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.539> track

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
driver it's the hard part but the track

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.810

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
we were probably halfway done and then

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
we were probably halfway done and then
looked<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.389> saw<00:05:00.479> a<00:05:00.509> checkered
