10<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.109> 12<00:00:19.410> apples<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:23.180> started<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
10 or 12 apples in here I started with a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.750 
10 or 12 apples in here I started with a
out<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.930> water<00:00:25.430> in<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.060> weather<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.930> here

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
out to the water in the weather in here

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.330 
out to the water in the weather in here
and<00:00:29.760> use<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.210> ounce<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.750> agave<00:00:31.109> nectar<00:00:31.340> which

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and use one ounce of agave nectar which

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.680 
and use one ounce of agave nectar which
isn't<00:00:32.640> really<00:00:32.669> necessary<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
isn't really necessary because the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870 
isn't really necessary because the
apples<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.230> sweet<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.579> there's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.730> little
