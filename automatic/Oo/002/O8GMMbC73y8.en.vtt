titanium blaze stove I'm gonna fill them
both<00:00:46.130> up<00:00:46.370> with<00:00:46.550> 500<00:00:47.180> mil<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.010> we'll<00:00:49.239> see<00:00:50.239> which

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
both up with 500 mil and we'll see which

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.280 
both up with 500 mil and we'll see which
is<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.630> quickest<00:00:53.260> okay<00:00:54.670> both<00:00:55.670> set<00:00:56.030> up<00:00:56.290> both

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
is the quickest okay both set up both

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.860 
is the quickest okay both set up both
got<00:00:57.590> 500<00:00:58.280> milliliters<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.969> room-temperature

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
got 500 milliliters of room-temperature

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.329 
got 500 milliliters of room-temperature
water<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.730> I'm<00:01:02.149> gonna<00:01:02.739> I'm<00:01:03.739> gonna<00:01:03.950> get<00:01:04.189> them

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
water so I'm gonna I'm gonna get them

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.039 
water so I'm gonna I'm gonna get them
both<00:01:04.659> cracking<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.670> we'll<00:01:07.820> see<00:01:08.090> see<00:01:08.899> which

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
both cracking and we'll see see which

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.169 
both cracking and we'll see see which
one<00:01:09.259> comes<00:01:09.499> out<00:01:09.709> with<00:01:09.859> the<00:01:09.950> fastest<00:01:10.340> time<00:01:10.579> I

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
one comes out with the fastest time I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:27.190 
one comes out with the fastest time I
hope<00:01:11.509> is<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.780> Jetboil

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.530 

right

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:59.039 

so<00:01:31.170> clock<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.400> go

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.560 

so<00:02:00.810> 30<00:02:01.810> seconds<00:02:02.289> in<00:02:02.820> Jetboil<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:04.090> mean<00:02:04.359> I<00:02:04.390> could

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
so 30 seconds in Jetboil I mean I could

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.749 
so 30 seconds in Jetboil I mean I could
see<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.810> water<00:02:04.929> already<00:02:05.409> starting<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:06.640> go

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
see the water already starting to to go

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.839 
see the water already starting to to go
in<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.969> Jetboil<00:02:08.160> getting<00:02:09.160> bubbles<00:02:09.459> comin<00:02:09.759> to

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
in the Jetboil getting bubbles comin to

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.059 
in the Jetboil getting bubbles comin to
this<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.360> surface<00:02:10.720> already<00:02:10.920> nothing<00:02:11.920> really

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
this the surface already nothing really

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
happening with the high gear titanium

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:39.589 
happening with the high gear titanium
store<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.810> minute<00:02:17.400> keep<00:02:18.400> an<00:02:18.519> eye<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.670> it

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.649

gear stores just started we're just

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.930 
gear stores just started we're just
starting<00:03:28.950> at<00:03:29.129> some<00:03:29.220> googles<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.730> bottom

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
