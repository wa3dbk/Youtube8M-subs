00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 and now the weather 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 First of all tonight temperatures around 2 or 3 degrees inland maybe 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.190
 in favor 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 and in the coastal areas a grade of 6 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 Well especially in the north there is a chance of clouds and some light rain maybe 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.950
 well 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.320
 and what are you doing 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.760
 and again for tomorrow 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.720
 in the morning from the north population in the north perhaps 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.369
 a little light rain 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.189
 little suggests the sun also appears occasionally first in the south 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.950
 and later again in the north of the country 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.799
 the temperatures lower than in recent days about 12 or 13 degrees and the wind 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.789
 catalans feel powerful along the coast from north to northeast and what a 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.330

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.890

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.210
 see it every 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 and what is the next group 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 scouts a gamer looking up a guy 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.049
 and again for Wednesday 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.999
 and there with clouds with sun with dry weather but the temperature is still a bit 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.390
 lower 10 or 11 degrees can be used as real land and the wind that comes from the north 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.689
 direction is moderate or fairly powerful 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.889
 and you are the scouts and what age is that or that in the food 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.919
 eleven out of fourteen and a group of civil servants 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.560
 now we go up but the astronauts and the prospects 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.010
 on Thursday it will remain dry with a temperature of around 13 degrees 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.840
 I get this I have something up there is a fair amount of sun but then come 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.460
 on friday and saturday with a few showers off showers I can't be better 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.960
 lots of rain but still a little wetness the sun is also there 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.139
 and the temperature averages 13 degrees 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.120
 and at any age the astronauts are from 2 to 6 p.m. 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.389
 the father is your days 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.480
 well i think you will have pretty good weather on saturday 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.949
 case those dry periods turn and we are going to talk about it again and again 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.159
 before tomorrow 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.590
 during the morning rush hour in the north chance of some light rain and so 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:07.180
 cloud cover 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.770
 in the southern part of our country 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.450
 that offers low sun especially applies to the early morning rush hour 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.939
 evening peak has sun and clouds 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.389
 and dry weather 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.189
 and slowly we head towards the Easter weekend that happened with the 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.109
 Easter to its own sporting success 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.149
 and what are you going to do with Easter plans that came through government already 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.959
 congratulations 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.849
 the expectation for the Easter days 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.879
 scored more on the 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.870
 Easter Sunday Easter Sunday 40 percent on Easter Monday 16 percent go 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 temperature also up like the state 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.079
 so that still looks reasonable 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.069
 they clear up 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.069
 until Saturday and Sunday when market parties 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.949
