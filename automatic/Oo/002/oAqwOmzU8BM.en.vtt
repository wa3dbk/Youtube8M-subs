00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.390 
but that's another one down also does
this<00:02:26.950> mount<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.400> know<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.850> new<00:02:28.000> mouth

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
pretty cool all right so we have a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.820 
pretty cool all right so we have a
another<00:02:33.310> rare<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.780> town<00:02:35.500> or
