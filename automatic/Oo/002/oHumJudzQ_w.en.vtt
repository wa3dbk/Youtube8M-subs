00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.629 
up so as you can see that's quite a lot
it'll<00:03:16.069> be<00:03:16.190> good

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
it'll be good

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.400 
it'll be good
I'm<00:03:17.120> not<00:03:17.299> putting<00:03:17.569> anything<00:03:17.720> crazy<00:03:18.139> and

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
I'm not putting anything crazy and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.890 
I'm not putting anything crazy and
that's<00:03:18.530> mostly<00:03:18.919> gonna<00:03:19.099> be<00:03:19.190> anubias<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.060> stuff

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
that's mostly gonna be anubias and stuff

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.699 
that's mostly gonna be anubias and stuff
like<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.930> lighting<00:03:30.139> system<00:03:30.470> is

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
like that so the lighting system is

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.720 
like that so the lighting system is
pretty<00:03:30.980> cool<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.319> only<00:03:33.470> thing<00:03:33.829> I've<00:03:34.549> got

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
pretty cool and the only thing I've got

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.659 
pretty cool and the only thing I've got
any<00:03:34.880> criticisms<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.690> it's<00:03:35.989> all<00:03:36.549> basically<00:03:37.549> the

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
any criticisms of it's all basically the

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.140 
any criticisms of it's all basically the
lifts<00:03:38.859> no<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:40.280> basically<00:03:40.579> just<00:03:40.669> get<00:03:40.880> blast

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
lifts no you basically just get blast

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.780 
lifts no you basically just get blast
loads<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.769> put<00:03:42.950> these<00:03:43.069> little<00:03:43.130> clips<00:03:43.609> on

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
loads and you put these little clips on

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.229 
loads and you put these little clips on
them<00:03:43.940> which<00:03:44.180> time<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.200> set<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> full

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
them which time you just set the full

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.349 
them which time you just set the full
the<00:03:47.239> full<00:03:47.269> sections<00:03:47.959> off<00:03:48.200> when<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.359> working

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
the full sections off when you working

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.659 
the full sections off when you working
on<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.599> what<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.530> dot<00:03:51.739> fit<00:03:52.069> there's<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.459> world

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
on it what the dot fit there's the world

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.400 
on it what the dot fit there's the world
I'm<00:03:53.000> suppose<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.389> can<00:03:53.569> mess<00:03:53.750> about<00:03:53.870> getting

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
I'm suppose you can mess about getting

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.430 
I'm suppose you can mess about getting
these<00:03:54.530> exactly<00:03:55.160> spaced<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.849> pushed<00:03:56.120> in<00:03:56.440> for

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
these exactly spaced and pushed in for

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:08.440 
these exactly spaced and pushed in for
ages<00:03:57.859> but<00:03:58.099> I<00:03:58.459> got<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.780> do<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:05.079> stuff<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.260> go
