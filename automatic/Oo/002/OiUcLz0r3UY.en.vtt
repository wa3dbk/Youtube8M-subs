hi guys I'm Craig Blundell in this video
we're<00:00:26.020> going<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.200> be<00:00:26.260> looking<00:00:26.439> at<00:00:26.619> hybrid

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
we're going to be looking at hybrid

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.950 
we're going to be looking at hybrid
setup<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.700> how<00:00:27.939> it<00:00:28.060> can<00:00:28.150> improve<00:00:28.390> musicality

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
setup and how it can improve musicality

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.370 
setup and how it can improve musicality
live<00:00:29.950> performance<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.730> practice<00:00:31.210> first<00:00:32.169> up

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
live performance and practice first up

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.110 
live performance and practice first up
we're<00:00:32.800> gonna<00:00:32.950> look<00:00:33.070> at<00:00:33.280> basic<00:00:33.640> click<00:00:33.880> track

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
we're gonna look at basic click track

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:44.670 
we're gonna look at basic click track
with<00:00:34.660> one<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:34.870> our<00:00:34.930> modules<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:44.140> if<00:00:44.559> we're

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
with one of our modules now if we're

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.380 
with one of our modules now if we're
looking<00:00:44.920> at<00:00:45.010> playing<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.399> time<00:00:45.609> it<00:00:45.879> gets<00:00:46.059> no

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
looking at playing in time it gets no

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.119 
looking at playing in time it gets no
simpler<00:00:46.930> than<00:00:47.199> playing<00:00:47.440> along<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.859> a<00:00:47.890> click

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
simpler than playing along to a click

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.400 
simpler than playing along to a click
track<00:00:48.280> what<00:00:48.910> I've<00:00:49.030> got<00:00:49.180> here<00:00:49.359> is<00:00:49.539> is<00:00:49.809> obviously

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
track what I've got here is is obviously

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.259 
track what I've got here is is obviously
my<00:00:50.559> acoustic<00:00:50.829> kit<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.730> can<00:00:51.850> just<00:00:52.030> put<00:00:52.180> my

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
my acoustic kit and I can just put my

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.880 
my acoustic kit and I can just put my
module<00:00:52.600> by<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.809> side<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.289> so<00:00:53.320> use<00:00:53.649> it<00:00:53.769> as<00:00:53.859> a

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
module by the side of it so use it as a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.669 
module by the side of it so use it as a
metronome<00:00:54.280> now<00:00:55.059> what<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.600> try<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:55.960> do<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.500> my

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
metronome now what I try and do with my

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.560 
metronome now what I try and do with my
students<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.280> myself<00:00:57.429> from<00:00:57.820> warming<00:00:58.149> up<00:00:58.359> is<00:00:58.510> I

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
students and myself from warming up is I

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.569 
students and myself from warming up is I
practice<00:00:59.140> at<00:00:59.230> those<00:00:59.350> awkward<00:00:59.620> tempos<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.429> that

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
practice at those awkward tempos so that

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.790 
practice at those awkward tempos so that
the<00:01:00.699> small<00:01:01.000> slower<00:01:01.329> tempos<00:01:01.809> because<00:01:02.559> as

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
the small slower tempos because as

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.530 
the small slower tempos because as
humans<00:01:03.219> wise<00:01:03.370> we<00:01:03.640> we<00:01:03.910> speed<00:01:04.150> up<00:01:04.300> we<00:01:04.420> get

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
humans wise we we speed up we get

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.660 
humans wise we we speed up we get
excited<00:01:05.050> it's<00:01:05.230> it's<00:01:05.440> part<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.040> what<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.370> do<00:01:06.520> we

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
the Michener will always be in time so

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.030 
the Michener will always be in time so
if<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.950> put<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.310> press<00:01:13.050> tempo<00:01:14.050> here<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:14.950> can

if I put it press tempo here so you can

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.590 
if I put it press tempo here so you can
see<00:01:15.160> it's<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> 100<00:01:15.700> bpm<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.240> we'll<00:01:16.329> keep<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
see it's a 100 bpm and we'll keep it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.100 
see it's a 100 bpm and we'll keep it
there<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:17.200> press<00:01:17.350> click<00:01:17.680> on<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.990> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
click modules like the TD 15 and TD 11

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.370 
click modules like the TD 15 and TD 11
have<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> whole<00:02:06.670> host<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.149> really<00:02:07.420> cool<00:02:07.810> coach

practicing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.729 
practicing
now<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.880> use<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.210> using<00:02:19.480> basic<00:02:19.690> 4/4<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.650> I

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
now that's use just using basic 4/4 if I

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.910 
now that's use just using basic 4/4 if I
drop<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.069> tempo<00:02:21.340> back<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.640> 100<00:02:21.940> bpm<00:02:22.360> again<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
drop the tempo back to 100 bpm again you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.960 
drop the tempo back to 100 bpm again you
can<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.129> some<00:02:24.280> other<00:02:24.370> things<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> clicks

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
can do some other things for the clicks

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.170 
can do some other things for the clicks
if

previously<00:03:55.690> we<00:03:55.870> looked<00:03:55.990> at<00:03:56.260> click<00:03:56.560> track<00:03:56.800> on<00:03:57.010> a

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
previously we looked at click track on a

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
previously we looked at click track on a
module<00:03:57.340> let's<00:03:57.910> look<00:03:58.120> at<00:03:58.300> click<00:03:58.660> track<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:59.080> an

module let's look at click track on an

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.920 
module let's look at click track on an
SPD<00:03:59.620> SS<00:03:59.950> now<00:04:00.550> we<00:04:00.610> can<00:04:00.790> see<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.030> flashing<00:04:01.360> here<00:04:01.660> I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
SPD SS now we can see it flashing here I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.590 
SPD SS now we can see it flashing here I
can<00:04:02.380> simply<00:04:02.680> press<00:04:02.710> start<00:04:03.220> or<00:04:03.400> stop<00:04:03.490> I<00:04:03.940> can

can simply press start or stop I can

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.660 
can simply press start or stop I can
change<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.930> tempo<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.320> each<00:04:05.590> patch<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.490> on

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
change the tempo to each patch so it on

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.480 
change the tempo to each patch so it on
patch<00:04:06.910> 1<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.330> example<00:04:07.390> if<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.200> 120<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.070> can

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
patch 1 for example if it's 120 I can

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.520 
patch 1 for example if it's 120 I can
make<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.670> click<00:04:09.820> track<00:04:09.940> go<00:04:10.120> at<00:04:10.209> 120<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:10.959> off

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
make the click track go at 120 and off

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.290 
make the click track go at 120 and off
you<00:04:11.740> go<00:04:11.770> one<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.580> great<00:04:12.790> features<00:04:13.000> about

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
you go one of the great features about

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.820 
you go one of the great features about
this<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.690> don't<00:04:13.810> have<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.560> put<00:04:14.740> your

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
this is you don't have to put your

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.920 
this is you don't have to put your
sticks<00:04:15.070> down<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.640> I'm<00:04:16.000> assigned<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.630> click

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
sticks down so I'm assigned the click

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.800 
sticks down so I'm assigned the click
track<00:04:17.079> here<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.590> 174<00:04:18.430> BPM<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.420> put<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.750> on

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
track here to 174 BPM and I put it on

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.310 
track here to 174 BPM and I put it on
pad<00:04:20.049> 9<00:04:20.260> so<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.560> can<00:04:20.680> hit<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:22.200> just<00:04:23.200> hit<00:04:23.290> it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
pad 9 so I can hit it and just hit it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.920 
pad 9 so I can hit it and just hit it
again<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.710> stop<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.250> all<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:25.150> my<00:04:25.180> pads<00:04:25.600> are

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
again to stop so all of my pads are

00:04:25.930 --> 00:05:00.029 
again to stop so all of my pads are
assigned<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.770> 174<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:27.730> get<00:04:27.910> this

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.350 

so<00:05:01.039> while<00:05:01.190> we're<00:05:01.280> talking<00:05:01.310> about<00:05:01.850> click

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
so while we're talking about click

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.230 
so while we're talking about click
tracks<00:05:02.660> let's<00:05:03.229> look<00:05:03.470> at<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.830> octopod<00:05:04.340> SPD<00:05:04.940> 30

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
tracks let's look at the octopod SPD 30

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.300 
tracks let's look at the octopod SPD 30
now<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.229> can<00:05:06.380> do<00:05:06.440> some<00:05:06.620> really<00:05:06.919> cool<00:05:07.250> things

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
and round around I can choose to take it

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.180 
and round around I can choose to take it
away<00:05:29.810> after<00:05:30.199> one<00:05:30.380> phrase<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.800> I<00:05:30.830> wanted<00:05:31.130> to

there we go we can then go part three

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.710 
there we go we can then go part three
let's<00:05:48.259> put<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> little<00:05:48.620> 808<00:05:49.190> on<00:05:49.310> there<00:05:49.720> just
