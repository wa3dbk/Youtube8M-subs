 slates so here we present you 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.200
 today so the following of what we 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.349
 showed the news concerning the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.529
 android tablets planned for this year 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.020
 we have here the model is called the s6000 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.119
 this is their top model and by 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.829
 compared to the two models at 1000 and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.290
 3000 who were 17 inches here we have a 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.850
 model that in 10.1 inches recognizes on 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.579
 internet that is on the same range little 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.719
 near a channel no doubt a galaxy 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.640
 what we are going to launch from his level of 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.140
 specs everything and everything is a little bit at 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.339
 above what we have seen with the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.710
 models at 1000 to 3000 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:57.630
 we will be on a quad core processor 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.510
 clocked at 1.2 ghz 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.370
 a model from mediatek in terms of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.940
 android version we are on we are on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.940
 from 4 points 2 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.640
 and then we even at the screen 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.720
 so born notch that this time and 720p 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.880
 with a resolution of 1280 by 800 which 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.980
 really allows to have a more screen 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 bright to have enough navigation 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.280
 fluid 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.640
 at the level of memory we will have a 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.030
 gig of ram and storage 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.470
 we are on models that will do 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 between 16 and 32 gigas of ram 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.410
 with a microsd slot to extend the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.980
 memory up to 64 extra giga 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.230
 at the interface level 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.440
 so as I say we are in android 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.850
 4 points 2 there is one at the level of 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.520
 Overlays has was very little 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.740
 things 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.710
 the laws mainly add these 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.030
 small files that can be found on 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.329
 the home screen on expensive linen but 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.060
 but we can expand 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.740
 and we continue to use the rest of 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.630
 the screen so we can add some 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 elements in so these are these folders 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.700
 which can also contain 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.129
 applications that directly open a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.640
 calendar open a weather finally 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.739
 perform actions are as per 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 example the folder to take some 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.590
 Notes 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.730
 so that's it's really the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.950
 main overlay that we will find 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.750
 otherwise the rest will be very similar to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.239
 from android to a pure android experience 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.799
 and we are sure 80 of this tablet 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.120
 will be available from the end of 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.660
 first semester so from the month 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 from June at a price of 299 euros 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.870
 see you soon
