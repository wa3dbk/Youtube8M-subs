00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 well, today I bring you a video 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.710
 request of a user who wanted the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 link and I really liked the idea too 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.389
 I want to thank free way 007 that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 has been supporting something else like in the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 fear past these links I looked for them 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 so if they match another tell me 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.029
 to change them I also want me 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.090
 warn if a link falls to find it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 leaving that aside let's start well as 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 on this topic I do not have much experience 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.939
 nor the asshole to program either 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 the city ​​does not put an order or that is not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 It is going from best to worst or worst to best 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 the first one I'm going to mention is going to be 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.290
 that of forest peer a de cover is a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.390
 delivery of the popular series of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.760
 racing video games need for speed 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.489
 developed by black box and distributed 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 by electronic the video game counts 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 with the presence of movie star 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 coolest international as detective 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.340
 chaslin one of the main 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 characters of the video game and also with 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.289
 the singer and actress christina milian 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 as Carmen hears what happened girl 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.550
 why did not you call me for the video because 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.860
 you're a fool on this subject like me 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 good in that you are not wrong I play 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 to good war games, stay but now 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 do not interrupt the games that you demand is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 burnout legends is the fifth part of the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.010
 popular video game franchise 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 burnout careers went on sale for 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.110
 the portable playstation consoles and for 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.120
 nintendo ds presents many of the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 tracks and game modes of the three 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.190
 first versions but in a new 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 container for many portable format 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.810
 of the game modes are similar to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 burnout 3 using some old and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.060
 new clues to see this I say it is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610
 the good we put a need for speed carbon 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 the version of need for speed carbon for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.280
 psp in on the city ​​is played as a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 expert runner who had an accident and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.050
 that remains in a cube months later 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.240
 wakes up and has amnesia what 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.399
 prevents remembering what happened and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 that his brother had died in that same 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.280
 career while he was the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.680
 survivor to that fatal accident 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.440
 so now you must earn respect 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 of all again while a biguá 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 because his brother died and who was the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.980
 guilty as he wins districts of the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 city and makes more colleagues by area 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.880
 begins to see everything clearer to 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.700
 find the one who killed the brother of the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.220
 good character here ends the first 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.370

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.810
 the video I want to investigate more games 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 Unfortunately these are the only ones 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.950
 has reached a good acceptable point 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.600
