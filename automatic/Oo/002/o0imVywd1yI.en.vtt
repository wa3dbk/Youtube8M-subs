00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
so-called momentum is going against you

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.080 
so-called momentum is going against you
if<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.160> like<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.370> games<00:05:15.550> get<00:05:15.729> into<00:05:15.970> their

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
favor then just making up the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.810 
favor then just making up the
substitutions<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.370> into<00:05:18.550> slow<00:05:18.700> yourself

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
substitutions and into slow yourself

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.370 
substitutions and into slow yourself
down<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.570> always<00:05:19.720> seems<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.080> like<00:05:20.229> come

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
down and you always seems to like come

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.790 
down and you always seems to like come
out<00:05:20.470> of<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.650> on<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.770> better<00:05:20.950> side<00:05:22.620> when<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.680> say

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
out of it on the better side when I say

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.200 
out of it on the better side when I say
when<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.160> say<00:05:24.280> slow<00:05:24.490> things<00:05:24.729> down<00:05:24.789> I<00:05:24.880> mean<00:05:25.060> just

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
when I say slow things down I mean just

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.520 
when I say slow things down I mean just
like<00:05:25.330> let<00:05:25.630> make<00:05:25.810> sure<00:05:25.960> you<00:05:26.020> just<00:05:26.139> hold<00:05:26.380> onto

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
like let make sure you just hold onto

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.680 
like let make sure you just hold onto
the<00:05:26.680> ball<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:26.860> keep<00:05:27.070> possession<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.729> be<00:05:28.660> a

the ball and keep possession and be a

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.350 
the ball and keep possession and be a
bit<00:05:28.810> more<00:05:28.840> careful<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.650> what<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:29.800> do<00:05:30.039> in<00:05:30.700> that

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
bit more careful of what you do in that

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
bit more careful of what you do in that
gap<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:33.550> finish<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.000> at<00:05:34.780> Wellington<00:05:35.020> them

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
don't know that was a instant show-off

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.850 
don't know that was a instant show-off
of<00:05:40.599> how<00:05:40.720> all<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:40.990> substitutions<00:05:41.229> worked<00:05:41.650> or

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
of how all the substitutions worked or
