00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.190
 A good file is an indoor ski slope 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.950
 since 1990 we have started it 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.340
 growing ski lessons at an indoor 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.810
 ski run the rosettes brian de ben 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.580
 where the mountain, as it were, passed through it 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.340
 writes instead you down the mountain 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.380
 shoot and the miracle of is that you have one 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.939
 making almost endless repetition 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.939
 you can train each other completely 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.930
 We hold the first of contributors 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.130
 at least we have a capsule of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.600
 muscles don't cry because they know it 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.540
 not yet so actually I have this 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.580
 to what kind of people 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.220
 we get namely 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.530
 novice skiers but also people who already 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.750
 have shaken a few years and on 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.830
 that way in this way and technique 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 as it were a small one every time 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.280
 bit by it will want free 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.770
 improve 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.440
 we also have people who really play that role 22 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.900
 years of skiing and seeing it as on 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
 training which also as a cozy 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.950
 evening and in addition you go on a tour 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.140
 prepare for the weeks that they just 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.479
 snow go a year ago we thought 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.869
 well it is time for one 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:30.640
 renovation and what moments are again 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.009
 came in contact with rob van schie and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 and the conversations with him are us 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.210
 actually very slowly very slowly 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 come to the concept of what the wall 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.990
 behind us 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.280
 we actually wanted to be a little trendy 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.840
 bar the way but wherever people 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.030
 feel like there 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.370
 yes that something special is going on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.470
 where a nice atmosphere is used 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.630
 and I think we are with help from below 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.190
 others our interior designs 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 that is paper to write here in mountains 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.140
 on zoom and this concept like the way 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.810
 is set with the industry look on 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.360
 the outside and the trendy bar 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.570
 inside and the warm there so that 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.300
 that's his idea and he has one there 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.300
 very nice work out 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.330
 and
