00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
hello everybody today I am going to be

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.410 
hello everybody today I am going to be
teaching<00:00:20.200> you<00:00:20.590> how<00:00:20.620> to<00:00:20.950> disassemble<00:00:21.730> and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
teaching you how to disassemble and

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.190 
teaching you how to disassemble and
reassemble<00:00:22.510> your<00:00:23.500> type-c<00:00:24.160> wit<00:00:24.420> 2v1<00:00:25.420> I'm

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
reassemble your type-c wit 2v1 I'm

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.560 
reassemble your type-c wit 2v1 I'm
pretty<00:00:27.040> sure<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> v2<00:00:27.730> has<00:00:27.910> pretty<00:00:28.240> much<00:00:28.420> the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
pretty sure the v2 has pretty much the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.030 
pretty sure the v2 has pretty much the
same<00:00:28.720> magic<00:00:29.200> I<00:00:29.260> just<00:00:29.439> heard<00:00:29.650> it's<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.800> little

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
same magic I just heard it's a little

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.800 
same magic I just heard it's a little
harder<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.369> assemble<00:00:30.910> so<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.570> could<00:00:31.660> probably

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
harder to assemble so you could probably

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.140 
harder to assemble so you could probably
still<00:00:32.020> use<00:00:32.140> this<00:00:32.410> guide<00:00:32.800> if<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.040> had<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> b2<00:00:33.520> but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
still use this guide if you had a b2 but

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.850 
still use this guide if you had a b2 but
let's<00:00:35.110> just<00:00:35.260> get<00:00:35.410> started

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
let's just get started

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.390 
let's just get started
so<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.780> first<00:00:37.990> thing<00:00:38.140> you<00:00:38.230> want<00:00:38.380> to<00:00:38.470> do<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.890> you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
so the first thing you want to do is you

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.670 
so the first thing you want to do is you
want<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.610> find<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:40.210> corner<00:00:40.900> that<00:00:41.380> isn't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
want to find a corner that isn't

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560 
want to find a corner that isn't
attached<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.370> core<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.210> good<00:00:43.390> way<00:00:43.510> to

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
attached to the core and a good way to

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.240 
attached to the core and a good way to
figure<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:43.930> out<00:00:44.050> us<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.350> turn<00:00:44.530> aside<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.070> if

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
figure this out us to turn aside and if

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.010 
figure this out us to turn aside and if
the<00:00:45.400> screws<00:00:45.820> move<00:00:46.090> that's<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.570> like<00:00:46.720> I'm

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
the screws move that's it like I'm

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.450 
the screws move that's it like I'm
moving<00:00:47.260> this<00:00:47.380> left<00:00:47.620> side<00:00:47.800> instead<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.250> screws

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
moving this left side instead of screws

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.369 
moving this left side instead of screws
I'm<00:00:48.609> moving<00:00:48.910> with<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.899> means<00:00:50.050> one<00:00:50.350> of

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
I'm moving with it that means one of

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.680 
I'm moving with it that means one of
these<00:00:50.649> corners<00:00:51.370> on<00:00:51.640> left<00:00:51.969> side<00:00:52.059> might<00:00:52.600> be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
these corners on left side might be

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.270 
these corners on left side might be
attached<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.140> course<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.620> just<00:00:53.949> if<00:00:54.039> you<00:00:54.100> say<00:00:54.250> I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
attached of course so just if you say I

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.090 
attached of course so just if you say I
take<00:00:54.460> one<00:00:54.609> from<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.820> right<00:00:54.969> side<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.890> you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
take one from the right side then you

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.599 
take one from the right side then you
can<00:00:57.280> turn<00:00:57.460> on<00:00:57.940> at<00:00:58.359> 45<00:00:58.780> degrees<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.440> you<00:01:00.429> kind

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
can turn on at 45 degrees and you kind

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.540 
can turn on at 45 degrees and you kind
of<00:01:00.699> just<00:01:00.910> grip<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:02.050> corner<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:03.809> pull<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.930> out

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
of just grip the corner and pull it out

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.620 
of just grip the corner and pull it out
you<00:01:06.550> kind<00:01:06.730> of<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.000> use<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.270> little<00:01:07.510> force

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
you kind of have to use a little force

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.550 
you kind of have to use a little force
but<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.460> works<00:01:09.850> nicely<00:01:10.330> sometimes<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> pieces

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
but it works nicely sometimes the pieces

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.700 
but it works nicely sometimes the pieces
will<00:01:11.710> go<00:01:11.740> all<00:01:12.340> over<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.610> place<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.420> then<00:01:13.840> like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
will go all over the place and then like

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.040 
will go all over the place and then like
I<00:01:14.830> got<00:01:14.980> so<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.000> take<00:01:16.180> out<00:01:16.330> an<00:01:16.480> internal<00:01:16.900> piece

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
I got so you take out an internal piece

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.710 
I got so you take out an internal piece
a<00:01:17.590> few<00:01:17.650> internal<00:01:18.490> pieces<00:01:18.820> then<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.390> take<00:01:19.570> out

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
a few internal pieces then you take out

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.170 
a few internal pieces then you take out
more<00:01:19.900> corners<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:24.189> can<00:01:24.549> pretty<00:01:25.060> much

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
more corners then you can pretty much

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.480 
more corners then you can pretty much
just<00:01:25.810> start<00:01:26.380> assembling<00:01:27.340> from<00:01:27.880> here<00:01:32.430> okay<00:01:33.430> so

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
just start assembling from here okay so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.130 
just start assembling from here okay so
you<00:01:33.670> might<00:01:33.850> come<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.270> point<00:01:34.600> where<00:01:34.869> it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
you might come to a point where it's

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.929 
you might come to a point where it's
like<00:01:35.229> this<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.130> have<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:36.460> whole<00:01:36.610> corner

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
like this and you have this whole corner

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.090 
like this and you have this whole corner
section<00:01:37.119> left<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.689> it<00:01:38.380> might<00:01:38.530> be<00:01:38.680> harder<00:01:38.979> to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
section left and it might be harder to

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.069 
section left and it might be harder to
get<00:01:39.310> these<00:01:39.640> I'm<00:01:39.939> internal<00:01:40.420> pieces<00:01:40.600> up<00:01:40.840> then

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
get these I'm internal pieces up then

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.819 
get these I'm internal pieces up then
with<00:01:41.259> these<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.579> um<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.469> kind<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.710> have

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
with these and um these you kind of have

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.440 
with these and um these you kind of have
to<00:01:44.860> pull<00:01:45.130> once<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.549> get<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.909> you<00:01:46.060> can<00:01:46.210> get<00:01:46.329> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
to pull once you get one you can get the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.230 
to pull once you get one you can get the
corner<00:01:46.719> on<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.049> rest<00:01:47.229> last<00:01:47.530> two<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:47.860> easy<00:01:48.240> so

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
corner on the rest last two are easy so

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.940 
corner on the rest last two are easy so
this<00:01:49.810> one<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.020> kind<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.229> have<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.500> work<00:01:50.649> at<00:01:50.920> a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
this one you kind of have to work at a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.230 
this one you kind of have to work at a
little<00:01:51.340> bit<00:01:51.490> but<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.860> I'd<00:01:54.490> recommend<00:01:54.790> only

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
little bit but it and I'd recommend only

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.440 
little bit but it and I'd recommend only
taking<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.200> off<00:01:56.350> if<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:56.799> want<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.450> move

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
taking this one off if you want to move

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.940 
taking this one off if you want to move
the<00:01:58.600> car<00:01:58.780> otherwise<00:01:59.409> it's<00:01:59.680> really<00:01:59.710> not

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the car otherwise it's really not

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.889 
the car otherwise it's really not
necessary<00:02:02.250> okay<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:04.119> they<00:02:04.329> all<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.600> pretty

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
necessary okay so they all just pretty

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.029 
necessary okay so they all just pretty
much<00:02:05.020> come<00:02:05.170> out<00:02:05.229> once<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.530> get<00:02:05.649> one<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:05.890> them

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
much come out once you get one of them

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.120 
much come out once you get one of them
up<00:02:06.180> alright<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.240> this<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.659> your<00:02:07.810> car<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:09.039> you

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
up alright so this is your car if you

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.310 
up alright so this is your car if you
want<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.430> do<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:10.240> notification<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.110> go

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
want to do some notification you can go

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.980 
want to do some notification you can go
ahead<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.590> do<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.710> but<00:02:12.670> let's<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.750> focus

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
ahead and do that but let's just focus

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.770 
ahead and do that but let's just focus
on<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> pieces<00:02:14.710> real<00:02:14.890> quick<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.570> should

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
on the pieces real quick so you should

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.260 
on the pieces real quick so you should
have<00:02:17.020> eight<00:02:17.380> corner<00:02:18.340> shelves<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
have eight corner shelves you can just

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.650 
have eight corner shelves you can just
set<00:02:19.720> those<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:21.280> their<00:02:21.460> own<00:02:21.580> pile<00:02:21.880> real<00:02:22.270> quick

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
set those in their own pile real quick

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.619 
set those in their own pile real quick
now<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:24.129> ship<00:02:24.400> some<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.819> these<00:02:24.910> inner<00:02:25.180> edges

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
now you ship some of these inner edges

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.990 
now you ship some of these inner edges
you'll<00:02:26.200> notice<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.709> three<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.489> them<00:02:27.670> have

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
you'll notice that three of them have

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500 
you'll notice that three of them have
these<00:02:28.150> little<00:02:28.360> bumps<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:29.019> them

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
these little bumps on them

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.770 
these little bumps on them
and<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:30.440> other<00:02:30.620> 11<00:02:31.400> know<00:02:31.940> while<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.480> was<00:02:32.510> bad

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
and the other 11 know while I was bad

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.250 
and the other 11 know while I was bad
the<00:02:33.709> other<00:02:33.890> nine<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:36.019> kinda<00:02:36.230> just

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
the other nine don't and you kinda just

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.559 
the other nine don't and you kinda just
want<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.560> set<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> other<00:02:36.890> three<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.459> their<00:02:38.420> own

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
want to set the other three in their own

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.970 
want to set the other three in their own
little<00:02:38.870> pile<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.379> really<00:02:39.590> doesn't<00:02:39.860> matter<00:02:40.000> but

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
little pile it really doesn't matter but

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.240 
little pile it really doesn't matter but
yeah<00:02:42.980> I'm<00:02:43.400> just<00:02:43.489> gonna<00:02:43.870> set<00:02:44.870> these<00:02:44.989> away<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
then you want the three with the nubs

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.699 
then you want the three with the nubs
first<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.450> your<00:02:50.599> core<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.379> first

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
first and your core so you have so first

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.770 
first and your core so you have so first
thing<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> fit<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.450> turn<00:02:56.690> it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
thing you do is you fit it you turn it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500 
thing you do is you fit it you turn it
on<00:02:56.870> quorum<00:02:57.290> 45<00:02:57.680> degrees<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.670> set<00:02:58.909> one<00:02:59.090> part<00:02:59.360> in

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
on quorum 45 degrees you set one part in

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.339 
on quorum 45 degrees you set one part in
now<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.040> lift<00:03:01.579> up<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.810> other<00:03:02.840> arm<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
now you lift up the other arm of the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.800 
now you lift up the other arm of the
core<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.799> slide<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.310> under<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.569> should

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
core and slide it under and this should

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.770 
core and slide it under and this should
be<00:03:05.840> kind<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.410> locked<00:03:06.680> into<00:03:06.980> place<00:03:07.720> now<00:03:08.720> you

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
be kind of locked into place now you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.080 
be kind of locked into place now you
want<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.019> take<00:03:09.260> another<00:03:09.500> one<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.250> want<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
want to take another one and you want to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.599 
want to take another one and you want to
do<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.329> same<00:03:11.510> thing<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.440> between<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.579> and

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
do the same thing with between here and

here here and here here and here here

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.180 
here here and here here and here here
and<00:03:16.879> here<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.150> get<00:03:17.239> my<00:03:17.390> point<00:03:17.859> so<00:03:18.859> we're<00:03:19.069> gonna

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
and here you get my point so we're gonna

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.589 
and here you get my point so we're gonna
turn<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.549> 45<00:03:20.060> put<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.849> pull<00:03:22.849> this<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.390> a

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
turn this 45 put that in pull this up a

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.990 
turn this 45 put that in pull this up a
little<00:03:23.720> bit<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.200> kind<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.519> snap<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.879> into

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
little bit and just kind of snap it into

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.619 
little bit and just kind of snap it into
place<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.239> now<00:03:26.510> these<00:03:26.690> are<00:03:26.840> locked<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> now

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
place and now these are locked so now

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.750 
place and now these are locked so now
you<00:03:29.690> want<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> take<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.260> corner<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:31.459> doesn't

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
you want to take the corner it doesn't

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.280 
you want to take the corner it doesn't
really<00:03:31.849> matter<00:03:32.060> which<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:32.540> but<00:03:32.569> if<00:03:33.049> you<00:03:33.079> have

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
really matter which one but if you have

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.750 
really matter which one but if you have
a<00:03:33.319> logo<00:03:33.560> I'd<00:03:33.829> recommend<00:03:34.220> using<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.489> one

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
a logo I'd recommend using that one

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
a logo I'd recommend using that one
because<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.150> one<00:03:35.389> that's<00:03:35.480> gonna<00:03:35.630> be

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
because this is one that's gonna be

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.839 
because this is one that's gonna be
attached<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.410> core<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.220> sometimes<00:03:37.669> it's

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
attached to the core and sometimes it's

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.280 
attached to the core and sometimes it's
nice<00:03:37.970> no<00:03:38.329> but<00:03:38.599> since<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:38.870> really<00:03:39.079> don't<00:03:39.230> care

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
nice no but since I really don't care

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.409 
nice no but since I really don't care
you<00:03:40.190> kind<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.579> just<00:03:41.410> slide<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:43.419> alright

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
you kind of just slide it in alright

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.360 
you kind of just slide it in alright
this<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.349> probably<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> hardest<00:03:46.040> part<00:03:46.099> of<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
this is probably the hardest part of the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.150 
this is probably the hardest part of the
assembly<00:03:46.639> um<00:03:47.230> what<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.440> want<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.099> you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
assembly um what you want to do is you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.879 
assembly um what you want to do is you
want<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.340> take<00:03:49.489> your<00:03:49.639> left<00:03:49.880> on<00:03:50.739> internal<00:03:51.739> piece

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
want to take your left on internal piece

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.819 
want to take your left on internal piece
with<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.370> knob<00:03:52.639> on<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:54.319> kind<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.769> just

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
with the knob on it and you kind of just

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.920 
with the knob on it and you kind of just
want<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.669> push<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.120> in<00:03:56.239> there<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.540> first<00:03:56.690> thing

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
want to push it in there the first thing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.440 
want to push it in there the first thing
I<00:03:57.049> do<00:03:57.109> is<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.650> kind<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.950> get<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.220> one<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.549> and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
I do is that kind of get this one in and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.289 
I do is that kind of get this one in and
then<00:03:59.599> I<00:03:59.810> pull<00:04:00.470> out<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.040> put<00:04:01.579> down<00:04:01.760> in<00:04:02.919> so<00:04:04.299> now

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
then I pull out and put down in so now

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.420 
then I pull out and put down in so now
it's<00:04:05.720> kind<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.079> just<00:04:06.139> like<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.650> normal<00:04:06.829> 303

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
it's kind of just like a normal 303

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.580 
it's kind of just like a normal 303
assembly<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:09.019> either<00:04:09.109> assemble<00:04:09.530> it

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
assembly you can either assemble it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.020 
assembly you can either assemble it
solved<00:04:09.859> or<00:04:09.980> not<00:04:10.040> solved<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.639> might<00:04:10.849> have<00:04:11.000> a

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
solved or not solved you might have a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.740 
solved or not solved you might have a
few<00:04:11.239> corner<00:04:11.569> twists<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.849> so<00:04:13.849> you're<00:04:14.690> just

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
few corner twists but so you're just

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.300 
few corner twists but so you're just
gonna<00:04:14.900> put<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.260> an<00:04:15.349> edge<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.859> these<00:04:15.980> should

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
gonna put in an edge and these should

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.370 
gonna put in an edge and these should
slide<00:04:16.729> in<00:04:17.000> not<00:04:17.269> snap<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.900> compared<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.289> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
slide in not snap in compared to the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.740 
slide in not snap in compared to the
others<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.370> turn<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.669> core<00:04:20.060> arm<00:04:20.269> 45

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
others so you turn the core arm 45

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.890 
others so you turn the core arm 45
degrees<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.289> slide<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:21.769> in<00:04:22.690> now<00:04:23.690> we're

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
degrees and slide that in now we're

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.320 
degrees and slide that in now we're
gonna<00:04:23.990> take<00:04:24.260> a<00:04:24.289> corner<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.889> we're<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:26.000> going

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
gonna take a corner and we're just going

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.850 
gonna take a corner and we're just going
to<00:04:27.010> flip<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.190> in<00:04:28.340> like<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.870> now<00:04:30.770> we're

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
to flip that in like that and now we're

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.650 
to flip that in like that and now we're
gonna<00:04:31.010> take<00:04:31.190> another<00:04:31.280> internal<00:04:31.849> edge<00:04:32.090> we're

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
gonna take another internal edge we're

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.490 
gonna take another internal edge we're
going<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.810> put<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.289> between<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:35.780> corner<00:04:36.110> so

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
going to put it in between the corner so

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.490 
going to put it in between the corner so
it<00:04:36.770> finishes<00:04:37.220> off<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.969> kind<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.390> block<00:04:38.750> right

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
it finishes off this kind of block right

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.730 
it finishes off this kind of block right
here<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.430> kind<00:04:40.669> of<00:04:40.729> keeps<00:04:41.030> corner<00:04:41.479> still

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
here and this kind of keeps corner still

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.430 
here and this kind of keeps corner still
so<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:44.210> kind<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.480> just<00:04:44.690> like<00:04:44.780> assembly<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.350> a

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
so it's kind of just like assembly of a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.930 
so it's kind of just like assembly of a
3/8<00:04:45.740> back<00:04:45.890> three<00:04:46.100> after<00:04:46.340> this<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.670> you<00:04:46.730> know

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
3/8 back three after this so you know

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.080 
3/8 back three after this so you know
bring<00:04:47.540> this<00:04:47.960> down<00:04:48.430> now<00:04:49.430> we're<00:04:49.550> gonna<00:04:49.640> put<00:04:49.880> two

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
bring this down now we're gonna put two

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.070 
bring this down now we're gonna put two
corners<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:59.000> can<00:04:59.180> set<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.480> on<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.750> table

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
corners in you can set this on the table

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.040 
corners in you can set this on the table
if<00:05:00.170> you<00:05:00.260> want<00:05:00.850> all<00:05:01.850> right<00:05:01.940> now<00:05:02.870> we're<00:05:02.990> gonna

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
if you want all right now we're gonna

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.590 
if you want all right now we're gonna
take<00:05:03.380> one<00:05:03.770> edge<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.940> we're<00:05:05.090> gonna<00:05:05.180> put<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.420> in

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
take one edge and we're gonna put it in

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.750 
take one edge and we're gonna put it in
here<00:05:05.870> you're<00:05:06.140> here<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.620> what<00:05:07.220> I'd<00:05:07.340> suggest

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
here you're here and what I'd suggest

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.130 
here you're here and what I'd suggest
doing<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:08.060> if<00:05:08.180> you're<00:05:08.300> gonna<00:05:08.420> put<00:05:08.660> it<00:05:08.780> in<00:05:08.930> this

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
doing is if you're gonna put it in this

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.800 
doing is if you're gonna put it in this
slot<00:05:09.350> kind<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.280> hold<00:05:10.490> this<00:05:10.730> corner<00:05:11.210> down<00:05:11.390> and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
slot kind of hold this corner down and

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.990 
slot kind of hold this corner down and
just<00:05:12.740> kind<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:12.950> hold<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.250> whole<00:05:13.340> cube<00:05:13.640> down<00:05:13.790> so

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
just kind of hold the whole cube down so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.130 
just kind of hold the whole cube down so
it's<00:05:14.150> easier<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.450> put<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.720> because<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.990> might

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
it's easier to put it because it might

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.680 
it's easier to put it because it might
slide<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.530> little<00:05:15.770> bit

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
slide a little bit

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.920 
slide a little bit
so<00:05:17.890> right<00:05:18.890> now<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.370> could<00:05:19.670> put<00:05:19.940> this<00:05:20.240> last

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
so right now you could put this last

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.820 
so right now you could put this last
edge<00:05:21.170> in<00:05:21.320> right<00:05:21.470> here

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
edge in right here

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.040 
edge in right here
but<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.760> can<00:05:22.940> also<00:05:23.090> make<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.480> Assembly<00:05:23.930> of

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
but you can also make the Assembly of

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.900 
but you can also make the Assembly of
the<00:05:24.170> last<00:05:24.380> or<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:24.800> top<00:05:25.010> layer<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.340> lot<00:05:25.490> easier

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
the last or the top layer a lot easier

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.420 
the last or the top layer a lot easier
if<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.140> start<00:05:27.380> building<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.950> top<00:05:28.160> layer

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
if you just start building the top layer

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.950 
if you just start building the top layer
like<00:05:28.760> this<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.120> I'm<00:05:29.210> gonna<00:05:29.300> put<00:05:29.480> an<00:05:29.570> edge<00:05:29.720> in

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
like this so I'm gonna put an edge in

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.870 
like this so I'm gonna put an edge in
turn<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.740> little<00:05:30.950> bit<00:05:31.690> got<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.750> corner<00:05:33.880> the

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
turn a little bit got the corner the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.930 
turn a little bit got the corner the
corner<00:05:34.910> in<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:36.340> then<00:05:37.340> there's<00:05:37.610> like<00:05:37.790> this

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
corner in and then there's like this

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.240 
corner in and then there's like this
little<00:05:38.180> gap<00:05:38.600> you'll<00:05:38.900> see<00:05:39.140> or<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.920> internal

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
little gap you'll see or the internal

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.820 
little gap you'll see or the internal
edge<00:05:40.400> goes<00:05:40.640> so<00:05:40.880> you<00:05:40.940> kind<00:05:41.180> of<00:05:41.270> just<00:05:41.450> have<00:05:41.570> to

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.130 

get<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:45.950> in<00:05:46.070> there<00:05:46.220> it's<00:05:46.370> really<00:05:46.550> not<00:05:46.730> hard<00:05:47.140> now

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
get it in there it's really not hard now

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.460 
get it in there it's really not hard now
we're<00:05:48.230> gonna<00:05:48.320> take<00:05:48.620> another<00:05:48.950> corner<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:51.080> put

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
we're gonna take another corner and put

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.100 
we're gonna take another corner and put
that<00:05:51.650> in<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.150> in<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:53.300> little<00:05:53.630> area<00:05:53.900> right

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
that in and in this little area right

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.190 
that in and in this little area right
here<00:05:54.610> just<00:05:55.610> kind<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:55.850> push<00:05:56.600> that<00:05:56.780> internal

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
here just kind of push that internal

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.070 
here just kind of push that internal
piece<00:05:57.350> in<00:05:58.300> okay<00:05:59.300> so<00:06:00.550> at<00:06:01.550> this<00:06:01.610> point<00:06:02.150> we<00:06:03.050> are

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
piece in okay so at this point we are

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.080 
piece in okay so at this point we are
going<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.560> put<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.950> internal<00:06:04.370> edge<00:06:04.520> in<00:06:04.850> right

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
going to put the internal edge in right

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.650 
going to put the internal edge in right
here<00:06:06.160> so<00:06:07.160> this<00:06:07.490> one<00:06:07.700> just<00:06:08.000> fits<00:06:08.360> in<00:06:08.540> pretty

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
here so this one just fits in pretty

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.960 
here so this one just fits in pretty
nicely<00:06:09.310> um<00:06:11.440> at<00:06:12.440> this<00:06:12.890> point<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.520> assembly

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
nicely um at this point of the assembly

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.090 
nicely um at this point of the assembly
there's<00:06:14.210> two<00:06:15.020> ways<00:06:15.170> to<00:06:15.200> do<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.950> really

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
there's two ways to do it it really

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.200 
there's two ways to do it it really
doesn't<00:06:16.310> matter<00:06:16.550> what<00:06:16.730> you<00:06:16.790> do<00:06:16.940> I'm<00:06:17.090> gonna

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
doesn't matter what you do I'm gonna

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.690 
doesn't matter what you do I'm gonna
show<00:06:17.450> you<00:06:17.540> both<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.160> way<00:06:19.280> that<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.580> normally

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
show you both so the way that I normally

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.640 
show you both so the way that I normally
do<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.390> I<00:06:20.570> put<00:06:20.810> in<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.110> internal<00:06:21.530> edge

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
do it is I put in the internal edge

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.890 
do it is I put in the internal edge
first<00:06:21.950> and<00:06:22.370> you<00:06:23.270> kind<00:06:23.420> of<00:06:23.480> just<00:06:23.630> put<00:06:23.780> the

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
first and you kind of just put the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.230 
first and you kind of just put the
bottom<00:06:24.200> in<00:06:24.350> and<00:06:24.710> lift<00:06:24.920> the<00:06:25.100> top<00:06:25.370> up<00:06:25.670> and<00:06:26.150> it

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
bottom in and lift the top up and it

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.620 
bottom in and lift the top up and it
just<00:06:26.390> goes<00:06:26.510> right<00:06:26.690> in<00:06:27.250> now<00:06:28.310> you<00:06:29.210> there's

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
just goes right in now you there's

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.540 
just goes right in now you there's
really<00:06:29.690> no<00:06:30.020> trick<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.560> do<00:06:30.830> this<00:06:31.010> you<00:06:31.220> kind<00:06:31.370> of

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
really no trick to do this you kind of

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.350 
really no trick to do this you kind of
just<00:06:31.790> have<00:06:31.970> to<00:06:32.240> push<00:06:32.900> the<00:06:33.290> corners<00:06:33.650> in<00:06:34.360> and

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
just have to push the corners in and

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.990 
just have to push the corners in and
then<00:06:35.600> to<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.710> push<00:06:36.980> the<00:06:37.130> second<00:06:37.430> one<00:06:37.550> in<00:06:37.670> so

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
then to you push the second one in so

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.960 
then to you push the second one in so
another<00:06:38.420> way<00:06:38.540> you<00:06:38.630> can<00:06:38.870> do<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.740> last<00:06:39.970> two

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
another way you can do the last two

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.280 
another way you can do the last two
corners<00:06:41.330> and<00:06:41.630> edge<00:06:42.200> is<00:06:43.240> put<00:06:44.240> in<00:06:44.450> one<00:06:44.750> corner<00:06:45.020> it

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
corners and edge is put in one corner it

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.140 
corners and edge is put in one corner it
doesn't<00:06:45.590> really<00:06:45.680> matter<00:06:45.950> which<00:06:46.160> one<00:06:46.220> just

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
doesn't really matter which one just

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.560 
doesn't really matter which one just
kind<00:06:47.420> of<00:06:47.600> push<00:06:48.140> it<00:06:48.170> in<00:06:48.700> there<00:06:49.700> like<00:06:50.090> that<00:06:50.270> and

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
kind of push it in there like that and

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.170 
kind of push it in there like that and
now<00:06:51.290> you<00:06:51.410> can<00:06:51.620> put<00:06:51.740> the<00:06:51.860> internal<00:06:52.310> edge<00:06:52.490> in<00:06:52.880> and

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
now you can put the internal edge in and

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.519 
now you can put the internal edge in and
then<00:06:53.510> the<00:06:53.630> last<00:06:53.780> corner

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 
then the last corner

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.299 
then the last corner
so<00:06:54.849> you<00:06:55.849> can<00:06:55.999> just<00:06:56.409> put<00:06:57.409> that<00:06:57.559> in<00:06:57.799> and<00:06:58.569> then

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:00.309 
so you can just put that in and then

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:02.559 
so you can just put that in and then
what<00:07:01.309> I<00:07:01.339> like<00:07:01.549> to<00:07:01.669> do<00:07:01.789> is<00:07:01.879> I<00:07:01.969> like<00:07:02.059> to<00:07:02.119> try<00:07:02.419> and

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569 
what I like to do is I like to try and

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.539 
what I like to do is I like to try and
put<00:07:02.689> like<00:07:02.869> one<00:07:03.139> part<00:07:03.379> of<00:07:03.439> the<00:07:03.529> corner<00:07:03.859> inside

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:04.549 
put like one part of the corner inside

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.669 
put like one part of the corner inside
that<00:07:04.909> hole<00:07:05.149> as<00:07:05.329> far<00:07:05.569> as<00:07:05.659> it<00:07:05.779> can<00:07:05.839> go<00:07:05.899> then<00:07:06.529> you

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:06.679 
that hole as far as it can go then you

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:10.179 
that hole as far as it can go then you
just<00:07:06.829> kind<00:07:07.039> of<00:07:07.069> wiggle<00:07:07.219> it<00:07:07.429> in<00:07:07.519> and<00:07:09.129> now<00:07:10.129> you

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:10.189 
just kind of wiggle it in and now you

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.439 
just kind of wiggle it in and now you
should<00:07:10.639> have<00:07:10.669> assembled<00:07:11.269> your<00:07:11.899> type<00:07:12.229> su<00:07:12.559> 2x2

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449 
should have assembled your type su 2x2

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:20.109 
should have assembled your type su 2x2
correctly<00:07:14.449> and<00:07:15.019> now<00:07:15.889> if<00:07:16.669> you<00:07:18.489> didn't<00:07:19.489> put<00:07:20.029> it

00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:20.119 
correctly and now if you didn't put it

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:21.969 
correctly and now if you didn't put it
in<00:07:20.149> a<00:07:20.269> soft<00:07:20.509> state<00:07:20.869> you<00:07:21.349> just<00:07:21.559> have<00:07:21.709> to<00:07:21.829> solve

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
in a soft state you just have to solve

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.399 
in a soft state you just have to solve
it<00:07:22.159> like<00:07:22.189> here's<00:07:22.669> a<00:07:22.759> corner<00:07:22.969> twist<00:07:23.319> so<00:07:24.319> you

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.409 
it like here's a corner twist so you

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.919 
it like here's a corner twist so you
just<00:07:24.559> twist<00:07:24.769> it<00:07:24.889> back<00:07:27.519> so<00:07:28.519> I<00:07:28.909> hope<00:07:29.659> this

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:29.929 
just twist it back so I hope this

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.649 
just twist it back so I hope this
tutorial<00:07:30.889> helps<00:07:31.519> I<00:07:31.849> know<00:07:31.999> a<00:07:32.149> lot<00:07:32.359> of<00:07:32.389> people

assembling this the first few times I

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:38.859 
assembling this the first few times I
assembled<00:07:37.939> this<00:07:38.029> because<00:07:38.239> it<00:07:38.359> internally

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:38.869 
assembled this because it internally

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.349 
assembled this because it internally
popped<00:07:39.339> it<00:07:40.339> was<00:07:40.459> a<00:07:40.489> little<00:07:40.759> hard<00:07:40.909> for<00:07:40.969> me<00:07:41.149> but
