00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I've clicked on the code we're into you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.490 
I've clicked on the code we're into you
and<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.330> determine

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and this will determine

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.530 
and this will determine
what<00:02:10.830> sort<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.160> software<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.820> loaded<00:02:12.210> on<00:02:12.360> your

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
what sort of software is loaded on your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.400 
what sort of software is loaded on your
ECU<00:02:13.380> now<00:02:14.780> depending<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.260> you've

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
ECU now depending on what you've

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.760 
ECU now depending on what you've
actually<00:02:16.950> installed<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.790> thee<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:19.170> actually

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
actually installed on thee you actually

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually installed on thee you actually
need<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.100> choose<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> correct<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.540> yet

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
need this choose the correct one yet

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
need this choose the correct one yet
in<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.350> case<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.800> easier<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.340> intend<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
in this case the easier that I intend to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.990 
in this case the easier that I intend to
talk<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.200> good<00:02:25.800> old<00:02:25.980> standard<00:02:26.400> boiling

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
talk to is the good old standard boiling

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.420 
talk to is the good old standard boiling
and<00:02:27.180> group<00:02:28.170> Omega<00:02:28.560> script<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.160> we'll<00:02:29.280> just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and group Omega script so we'll just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.650 
and group Omega script so we'll just
make<00:02:29.550> sure<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.880> select<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:31.040> will<00:02:32.040> control

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
make sure we select that I will control

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.830 
make sure we select that I will control
we're<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.050> use<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.510> staple<00:02:36.510> motor

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
we're not going to use the staple motor

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050 
we're not going to use the staple motor
from<00:02:37.110> gene<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.910> use<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
from gene we're just going to use a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.290 
from gene we're just going to use a
simple<00:02:39.480> on/off<00:02:39.690> failed<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:42.120> lambda

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
simple on/off failed and the lambda

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
simple on/off failed and the lambda
sensor<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.989> going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> narrow<00:02:43.890> band<00:02:44.190> o2

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
sensor is going to be a narrow band o2

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.540 
sensor is going to be a narrow band o2
sensor<00:02:45.000> obviously<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.959> ever<00:02:46.080> look<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.380> me

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
sensor obviously if you ever look at me

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.280 
sensor obviously if you ever look at me
you'll<00:02:47.550> see<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.060> hole<00:02:48.300> leaper<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.110> can

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
you'll see is a hole leaper then you can

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.410 
you'll see is a hole leaper then you can
choose<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.070> again<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> pins<00:02:51.300> are

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
choose one and again that the pins are

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.680 
choose one and again that the pins are
what<00:02:51.540> you're<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:51.930> trying<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.380> do

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
what you're actually trying to do

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.180 
what you're actually trying to do
blender<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.989> I'm<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.470> BA

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
blender now I'm a BA

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.760 
blender now I'm a BA
I<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:57.060> seeing<00:02:57.330> land<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.840> my<00:02:57.959> gauges<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.530> I'll

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
I like seeing land on my gauges so I'll

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.300 
I like seeing land on my gauges so I'll
set<00:02:59.190> it<00:03:00.110> fuelling<00:03:01.110> algorithm<00:03:01.770> well<00:03:02.130> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
set it fuelling algorithm well that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.280 
set it fuelling algorithm well that
depends<00:03:02.700> again<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.540> you're<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.959> do

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
depends again on what you're going to do

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.390 
depends again on what you're going to do
and<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:06.030> air<00:03:06.180> flow<00:03:06.360> meter<00:03:07.250> or<00:03:08.250> not

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
and if you have an air flow meter or not

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.240 
and if you have an air flow meter or not
we'll<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.209> go<00:03:09.600> for<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.050> speed<00:03:10.980> intensity

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
we'll just go for the speed intensity

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.770 
we'll just go for the speed intensity
one<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.880> font<00:03:12.150> for<00:03:12.300> what<00:03:12.390> we're<00:03:12.570> doing

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
one will be font for what we're doing

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.340 
one will be font for what we're doing
and<00:03:13.320> then<00:03:13.920> temperature<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.540> Celsius<00:03:16.049> I'll

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
and then temperature I like Celsius I'll

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.509 
and then temperature I like Celsius I'll
select<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:17.989> color<00:03:18.989> we're<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.070> really<00:03:20.280> too

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
select that color we're not really too

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.110 
select that color we're not really too
worried<00:03:20.820> about<00:03:20.910> kPa<00:03:21.780> yep<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:23.100> APA<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.640> make

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
worried about kPa yep I like APA so make

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.870 
worried about kPa yep I like APA so make
sure<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.360> thick<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.130> map<00:03:26.310> Center<00:03:26.700> in

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
sure that's thick and the map Center in

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.350 
sure that's thick and the map Center in
our<00:03:27.150> case<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.290> correct<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.880> if

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
our case is the correct one but if

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.660 
our case is the correct one but if
you're<00:03:30.510> doing<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:31.049> modifications

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
you're doing some modifications

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.890 
you're doing some modifications
obviously<00:03:32.670> yeah<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.360> train<00:03:33.570> some<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
obviously yeah you can train some of the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.789 
obviously yeah you can train some of the
map<00:03:34.080> sensors

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
map sensors

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.670 
map sensors
so<00:03:35.730> from<00:03:36.269> yeah<00:03:36.600> we're<00:03:37.140> just<00:03:37.170> gonna<00:03:37.380> select

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
so from yeah we're just gonna select

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.370 
so from yeah we're just gonna select
settings<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.549> then<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:39.269> we're<00:03:40.079> gonna<00:03:40.200> go

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
settings and then up here we're gonna go

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.000 
settings and then up here we're gonna go
save<00:03:41.420> we<00:03:42.420> don't<00:03:42.570> do<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.870> obviously<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.890> not

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
save we don't do that obviously it's not

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.400 
save we don't do that obviously it's not
going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> work<00:03:44.579> so<00:03:44.880> finally<00:03:45.690> we'll<00:03:46.049> just<00:03:46.260> go

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
going to work so finally we'll just go

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.819 
going to work so finally we'll just go
straight<00:03:46.680> back<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.920> doesn't<00:03:47.790> make<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.030> true

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
straight back to doesn't make it true

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.710 
straight back to doesn't make it true
yeah<00:03:49.829> you'll<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.579> gives<00:03:50.850> me<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.180> area

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
yeah you'll see that gives me this area

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.900 
yeah you'll see that gives me this area
what<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.739> guys<00:03:52.890> don't<00:03:53.130> notice<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.670> I'm

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
what you guys don't notice is that I'm

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.509 
what you guys don't notice is that I'm
actually<00:03:54.090> using<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.540> Macintosh<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.040> mean<00:03:56.400> I'm

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
actually using a Macintosh so I mean I'm

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.270 
actually using a Macintosh so I mean I'm
using<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.910> virtual<00:03:57.720> machine<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.530> I'll<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.160> to

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
using a virtual machine so I'll have to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800 
using a virtual machine so I'll have to
go<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.459> actually<00:03:59.640> connect<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.510> USB

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
go and actually connect the USB

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.740 
go and actually connect the USB
controller<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.970> that's<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.420> we'll

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
controller to this so that's what we'll

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.080 
controller to this so that's what we'll
do<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:05.100> main<00:04:05.250> thing<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.940> we've

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
do that the main thing is is that we've

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.259 
do that the main thing is is that we've

actually have got everything that we
need<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.959> connect<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:15.570> little

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
need so to connect that that little

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.979 
need so to connect that that little
program<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.890> look<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.750> will

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
program they look not that one we will

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.680 
program they look not that one we will
have<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.410> go<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.979> screen<00:04:20.310> yet<00:04:20.690> just

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
have to go out of the screen yet just

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.900 
have to go out of the screen yet just
going<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.109> single<00:04:22.440> wind

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
going to single wind

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.250 
going to single wind
see<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:25.090> my<00:04:25.480> screen<00:04:25.750> looks<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:26.170> little

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
see that my screen looks a little

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.480 
see that my screen looks a little
different<00:04:28.620> I'll<00:04:29.620> just<00:04:29.860> connect<00:04:30.310> with<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
different I'll just connect with the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.200 
different I'll just connect with the
senior<00:04:30.790> controller<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.700> I'll<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:34.000> take

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
senior controller and I'll just take

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.770 
senior controller and I'll just take
that<00:04:34.530> screen<00:04:35.530> back<00:04:35.830> again<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.940> we<00:04:37.450> don't<00:04:37.480> get

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
that screen back again so we don't get

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.170 
that screen back again so we don't get
to<00:04:37.930> connect<00:04:38.340> confused<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:40.110> now<00:04:42.030> when<00:04:43.030> you've

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
to connect confused it now when you've

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.360 
to connect confused it now when you've
done<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.350> all<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.860> pins<00:04:45.040> on<00:04:45.220> your

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
that's quite simple we're just going to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.370 
that's quite simple we're just going to
communications<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.530> okay<00:04:54.400> settings<00:04:55.380> and

you probably this one will work we'll
try<00:05:10.000> this<00:05:10.300> one<00:05:10.600> see<00:05:10.900> if<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.080> works

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
try this one see if it works

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.460 
try this one see if it works
no<00:05:12.040> see<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:12.820> one<00:05:13.090> doesn't<00:05:13.240> work<00:05:13.390> being<00:05:14.050> being

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
no see that one doesn't work being being

no see that one doesn't work being being
it's<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.800> USB<00:05:15.100> one<00:05:15.540> sometimes<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.690> just<00:05:16.720> need

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
it's a USB one sometimes you just need

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.980 
it's a USB one sometimes you just need
to<00:05:17.140> sort<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.820> go<00:05:18.820> through<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.180> list<00:05:19.390> really<00:05:19.660> to

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
to sort of go through the list really to

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
throttle position here we go and then

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.290 
throttle position here we go and then
you<00:06:46.199> take<00:06:46.379> a<00:06:46.529> temperature<00:06:46.889> be<00:06:47.819> this<00:06:47.969> one<00:06:48.149> yeah

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
you take a temperature be this one yeah

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.739 
you take a temperature be this one yeah
look<00:06:48.509> at<00:06:48.599> that

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:48.749

there she goes and the coolant

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.179 
there she goes and the coolant
temperature<00:06:51.539> we<00:06:52.139> can<00:06:52.169> adjust<00:06:52.379> that<00:06:52.740> to<00:06:52.800> sir

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
temperature we can adjust that to sir

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.449 
temperature we can adjust that to sir
for<00:06:53.699> all<00:06:53.729> intentional<00:06:54.300> purposes<00:06:54.779> I<00:06:54.899> think

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
that's all working so hopefully that's

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.049 
that's all working so hopefully that's
