up<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.780> four<00:02:18.050> inches<00:02:18.400> okay<00:02:19.400> let's<00:02:19.640> take<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.239> look

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
up to four inches okay let's take a look

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.420 
up to four inches okay let's take a look
at<00:02:20.599> what<00:02:20.750> our<00:02:20.780> program<00:02:21.349> would<00:02:21.530> look<00:02:21.739> like<00:02:21.950> to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
at what our program would look like to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.110 
at what our program would look like to
begin<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> program<00:02:24.830> number<00:02:25.340> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
begin with we have a program number and
