00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello everyone with you benders today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.490
 me a mod that all people will need 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 who love marie swim thing is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 that the current mod adds two new ones 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.820
 boats and which boats yes it's just 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 super boats and today I will tell you how 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.600
 they work like crafting therefore 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 let's start with crafting see craft 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.480
 we always start because mikroft and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 almost all kraft 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 ah ok let's get started so first 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 in business we will do this boat here 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.550
 Here is such a December brown 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 the boat is actually very cool but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.000
 let's start doing it and in order 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 to make it we need three 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 ordinary boat or 3 not 2 not one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.350
 and 3 so we have these three boats 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.570
 we put their craft window we fill them 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.430
 lower tier here so filling 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 lower tier and also we will need 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 shelves two sticks literally and wool 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 wool of any color she is responsible for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 very important thing i will use 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.300
 for example black wool 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 we lay out from here just such a thing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.340
 just such a small triangle and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 we get the item is a visible sip so 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.659
 This translates I not know but wise guys in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.549
 I will definitely write the comments honestly 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 would like you to write because i 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 I do not know please write here so we 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.090
 take this item and here it is shown that he 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.369
 did with a white sail but that's a lie friends 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 he is not with a white sail let's try 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.020
 run run it into the open sea and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.580
 as you can see there is no sail well but for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 so that we must appear in it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.350
 sit down in this boat and as you can see 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.659
 our sail begins to develop and he 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 really black means it depends 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.799
 on what color coat you choose 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.430
 there is if i took the white light then sail 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.380
 would be white 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.689
 that is, I am now on such a pirate 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.729
 schooner and fast by the way we swim faster 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.140
 than an ordinary boat fast sailing on 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.850
 some believe but I have to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.979
 come back because we are we are a workbench 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 and as you can see you even move 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 inside this boat she is a little flooded 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.000
 but the less we sail very normally and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.159
 This is actually a very cool mod. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 seriously more such cool mods 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 I found it just recently 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 i swim i have to say something so here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.979
 found it recently though as i understood it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.770
 for a long time there and appeared somewhere 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.509
 from version 14 some kind of there and also like you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.800
 could notice here there is a chest yes in 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.160
 This chest can put some 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.350
 things like black 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.330
 and she will be here that is you can 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.130
 quietly carry their stuff damn 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 awesome mod tired of you live 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 for example somewhere on the island you took 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.280
 churned their boat and swam away 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.990
 and what else is remarkable this boat is not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 breaks as usual when he repent 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.340
 on the obstacles it is actually the same 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.720
 cool but true to get out of it you need 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 use not just right click 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.790
 mouse shift and right mouse button and how 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 see we got out of it calmly and let 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.270
 here it will remain although it can also 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.800
 break you collect it okay 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.140
 move on to craft the next boat 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.540
 which is a little bit so broken 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.010
 that swims away with you boat go home well 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.960
 okay let's cut for put things on 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.030
 Kraft it is quite simple recipe for 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.040
 she is absolutely simple author of fashion 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.750
 I decided to just take and do to her 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.310
 the recipe was of three ordinary boats 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.230
 scraper made 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.970
 and get white hall help 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.100
 Whether it translates as the white boat 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.200
 so though i may be mistaken because my 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.880
 English is far away done she and so 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.770
 use this white i will call 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.660
 he was beaten as though it were possible 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.640
 not so it translates into a white boat 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.250
 we put it and let it float 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.830
 let him down the water and how is it different 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.380
 First of all, he has two cooler looks 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.320
 sails and then two chests and it's time to make 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 the day it becomes dark and the same 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.580
 he can carry passengers ie he is not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.450
 single that's all cool okay 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.120
 we sit in it 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.850
 I said sit in it and swam now 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
 we are lagging offshore sailing and how 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.750
 see now I'll show you the full 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.090
 the speed of this boat sails a little 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.520
 lag but now i think it will pass and 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.400
 and turn right steering I give 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.950
 right steering this lego was okay not so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.750
 less you see so far so that we 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.520
 should now by the way we should now 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.440
 float somehow behaves strangely this 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.290
 boat because in theory it should 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 swim forward and apparently i don't know what 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.490
 I say that there is not happening but that's all 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.530
 finally we swam swam all 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.390
 the sails develop we sail at full 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.760
 go at full speed go to meet 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.580
 adventures and as I said before 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.230
 this is not a single couple as a sailboat I 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.420
 I will call all the same sailboat you 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.680
 you can take and sit here and you don't 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.660
 will be able to manage more 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.130
 sailboat but you can sit like 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.320
 ordinary passenger and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.990
 it is very cool that is, passengers can 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.920
 be on their boat and the boat owner can 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.470
 take and transport passenger 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.420
 place to place for money oh how far am I 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.460
 it came out then by chance we sit back 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.160
 in this boat and as i said before then 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.350
 there are also two chests none 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.360
 a2 chest and you can climb into them 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.550
 wish I actually climbed u 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.670
 even their name is different now chest 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.390
 stork starboard chest starboard with legs 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.400
 star fleet to the chest okay yes like video 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.160
 the mod itself on this exhausts itself 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.020
 mod cool I think this is one of the best 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.210
 mods that I've seen lately 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.950
 Well, not counting the fact that he was changing sex 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.720
 after all, it's just an epic 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.940
 but nevertheless I think itâ€™s time 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.100
 say goodbye to you was bender thanks for 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.830
 viewing put your thumb up and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.780
 then you will become a real pirate and I 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.570
 swam towards adventure on this 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.790
 sailing boat meet me in 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.930
