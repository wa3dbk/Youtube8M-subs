00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.910
 description and annotations on the screen well, we 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.890
 hello to you all cuirassiers 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.550
 we keep playing the hunger games on 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 breeze island map and try 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 probably now okay right center 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:42.660
 I will go to the side of the body that we have here 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.090
 we have weapons here 1 ready 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 then probably I didn’t take anything either 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.370
 all who stay on the spawn most often not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.510
 or did not take or have already taken dofiga 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.510
 at least I have the impression 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:06.890
 so let's try this boy merge 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.890
 we have waves with a bib what a nafig 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 how did he know that I follow him 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:19.560
 probably looked just the main thing 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.460
 so once again I did not know who then is from here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 already blame is dangerous enough as 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.360
 Come on, come on ready bad php 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.930
 it's pipets 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.619
 That means you need to constantly 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 look around and then you nobody 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:46.829
 merge well there is someone impossible 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.820
 No weapons and maybe I do not have 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.580
 life is to take off 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 the main thing is not to fall on what I will have 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.080
 even less health, he shorter left 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.790
 From here it’s fine to me 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.160
 and do not need us so much grandfather there 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.400
 the passage is interesting here worked the little chest 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:18.390
 no the little chest turned out to be about an them so 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 bib one more appeared and still we 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.890
 there's a chest somewhere it's bottom here here 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 she's a nerd or not and he is not ableton 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 one flower now I have a very 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.489
 okay so where to go now let's 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.160
 look at spam can't anyone 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.120
 there is no 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.350
 with spavna apparently all have already gone well, you can 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 fix my armor 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:03:00.320
 and this is all reset so attempts man 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:05.180
 3 shoes are also in the fire all in the fire 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.390
 look for anyone right everything in the water already 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.640
 ran away 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:15.450
 somewhere bathe well ships rather 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:21.260
 just pluto can be checked on any 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:24.359
 the case oh let's take it we probably 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.660
 try to merge and not be more convenient 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.660
 place 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:45.170
 The main thing is to look so that it is neat. 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:48.080
 another shot where you are great of course 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.260
 for a split second lost sight 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:04:00.040
 and one more so fishing rods I watched 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.040
 appeared can be repaired 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:11.209
 lighter so two of them 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:18.889
 but they are against each other one kills 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:26.660
 another we kill him himself the arrow still 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:29.870
 one couple caught fire all this guy neither 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:40.840
 fuck yourself reluctance arrows certainly not 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 spend what to do 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.190
 taking damn spent how much 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.460
 arrows knows but I will now 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.660
 the sword will now be the sword this match 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.750
 2 people start 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.130
 I did not notice something that is the same 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:04.820
 us here u fishing rods still 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:09.020
 there is no it that is lit glasses so 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.610
 lighter is fine well on armor to me 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.070
 especially nothing needs to be done then 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.870
 arrows on the kremlin and 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.600
 silicon there is not overclocked so ok 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.240
 then we will wait and probably even take 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.650
 one lighter here so be it and 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.630
 quickly reach the hand and see who 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.639
 there against me was how 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.620
 good 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:41.440
 how well he is dressed he is so dressed 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:47.060
 sucks but armor I already dropped everything 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:51.800
 let's at least take something to 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:56.990
 be the armor on par with him and 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.900
 Well, let's try not to have a fishing rod 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.169
 advantage he has it he has a sword yet 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.360
 was full of figs but of course . 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:10.610
 could give him a victory if he 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.780
 pushed as it should be here in general in 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.520
 principle on this all big 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.990
