00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello welcome to kraft man if i am 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.290
 friend and this time I will be in a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.510
 tutorial super father let's do seven 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 express cards as they watch the video 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.680
 last seven minutes or so they are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 super easy to do fast and very 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 cheap as I already do May 10, 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 it occurred to present these ideas and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.360
 also tends to bring other ideas the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.489
 next week to be given to your 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.470
 mom but these cards the truth is 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.480
 that are like for several occasions 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.369
 and different people so we're going to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.350
 start with the tutorial we are going to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 need an opal sheet size 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 that we want our color card or 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.520
 coffee marker two paper hearts a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.560
 piece of cord and glue we start 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
 drawing a tree on one side of our 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.960
 card and the branches extended towards a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.750
 then make a bow on your lace 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.150
 and secure it with a double knot so that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.130
 We will not undo sticks 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.140
 ends that were left over to the hearts 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.620
 right in the middle of both so you do not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 see and cut the excess afterwards with a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.509
 little silicon in the part of the bun and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 stick on one of the branches of your tree 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.409
 you can do more details like leaves and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630
 flower 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.730
 and in the back you can write 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.830
 something 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.140
 we're going to need an opaline and 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.600
 little paper hearts can be decorated 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.510
 of colored cord and a needle that we 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.430
 serve to sew with this cord we will 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.230
 start by placing our hearts in 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.020
 where we want them to go on the card 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.900
 I'm going to use 4 hearts for each 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.240
 line and then we are going to make holes 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.400
 to start sewing you can know 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.950
 without making holes before but I 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.350
 I prefer to do them to go locating and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 also to make it easier for me to go 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.480
 going through the cardboard leaves the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.340
 loose ends because then the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.290
 we are going to stick in the back to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.330
 secure the hearts that we already knew 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.990
 You can make as many lines as 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.810
 you prefer 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.760
 I made three of four hearts and so 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.650
 It was like I got in the back 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.870
 You can paste another card so you do not 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.700
 notice the stitches for this idea let's 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.710
 to need what we have already come 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.510
 using and small hearts of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.520
 paper I made them with my exact in sheets 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.980
 of colors and we also need a 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.600
 white sheet on the white sheet we are going to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.700
 draw an envelope that is a rectangle 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.870
 simply with the tabs on the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.120
 four sides 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.040
 and we're going to cut it for later 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.810
 assemble it folding all sides towards 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.709
 inside and hitting just like I am 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.720
 doing 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.000
 if you over some edge cited Czech only 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.370
 trim it and erase the pencil lines 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.930
 that remained after this envelope 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 paste it in the part you like the most 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 your card leaving a little loose 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.049
 part that closes the envelope and starts 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.079
 paste the hearts we already had 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.610
 trimmed as if they came out of it for 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.250
 that did not look so simple I made him a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.440
 dotted border with black marker but 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.910
 you can put a message or you can 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.790
 do it on the inside of your 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.250
 card 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.200
 We are going to use cord and pennants 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.870
 triangular that you can cut from your 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 Decorated leaves or short colors 3 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.459
 pieces of cord that fit in your 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.890
 opaline and paste them with the help of silicon 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.810
 do it carefully so as not to muddy 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.239
 everything and with patience so that they remain you 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.090
 as hanging after cutting the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.920
 ends that over hitting me the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.500
 pennants as you like you can 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.299
 put more than 3 lines or less than 3 and 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.829
 you can write something in them like to 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.109
 who is the card or if it is for a 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.120
 special occasion and that's how it has us 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.799
 to stay when everything is stuck is 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.760
 very easy to do but it's really very 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.680
 pretty 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.450
 for this idea in addition to what we have already 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 come using we're going to need 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.890
 kraft paper on which we are going to draw 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.620
 a box starts with a straight line 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.870
 then draw two diagonal lines 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.579
 up on the right side and two 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.370
 diagonal lines up from the side 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.069
 left closes those with straight lines and 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.480
 draw a rhombus on the top 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.269
 then draw the lid of the box as 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.190
 if it was open and remark everything 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.470
 with a black marker to highlight 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.450
 starting by the lid of the box the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.520
 lines that no longer serve to erase them 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.739
 then cut out your box and paste on the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.209
 part of your card that you like and 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.040
 now let's hit the little hearts 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.870
 as we did with the envelope as if 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.519
 come out of the box you can also 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.270
 add a border to make it more 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.280
 pretty 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.170
 for this idea we are going to use one or 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.040
 page but we are going to double it by the 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.230
 half 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.720
 we're going to need decorated paper and everything 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.700
 the basics that we have been using in 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.550
 one side of your card drew a heart 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.230
 and then cut it with your exact you're going to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.330
 choose the part of the design that most suits you 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.950
 Like your decorated paper we are going to 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.380
 accommodate on your card and we're going to 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.620
 Paste cuts all the edge that is left over 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.660
 with the help of your exact this punch goes 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.400
 to see like that to highlight it again I 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.680
 I made a dotted line with a marker 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.330
 black around the edge of the heart 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.700
 you can use other figures like 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.070
 stars flowers maybe up to do the 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.470
 name of the most detailed person 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.290
 the last idea we're going to need clips 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.170
 tweezers and cord take your clip and open 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.840
 both ends out afterwards with 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.529
 your tweezers doubles this part that still 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.689
 she was curled back 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.359
 and you see how it begins to take the form 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.489
 of a hook afterwards with its tweezers 

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:16.369
 cut this excess so that it does not 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:18.349
 so long and it looks weird and then with 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:20.839
 your fingers then put it back together so that 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.729
 look like a little hook to me it seemed to me that 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.529
 this tie would be very closed so 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.349
 with my tweezers he opened it a little bit to 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:30.679
 that it looked more round I already lined 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.929
 my page on a decorated paper and also 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.879
 I made a little paper heart until 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:37.629
 piece of string to the hook and then 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.279
 hit a little heart to the extremes 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.989
 cut what was left and paste the hook to 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.070
 the card is how we have to 

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:46.600
 to stay is super super nice 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.010
 and well this has been all for the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.750
 tutorial today I hope you have them 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.760
 liked these ideas that I showed you how 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.530
 they saw they were easy fast and very 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.240
 originals remember that they can 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.830
