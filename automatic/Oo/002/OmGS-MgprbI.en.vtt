00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.410
 Yes I introduce this time 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.029
 Here 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.690
 Cree's 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.010
 Yellow led mounted 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.820
 With humby sky 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.710
 It will be here in the form with such a zoom function 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.800
 Hmm 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.800
 It can be done by squeezing or spreading 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.730
 1600 lumens 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:35.880
 Waiting for very bright light It is the notation 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.590
 This time I would like to compare it with this general flashlight. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.590
 Then let's irradiate 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.840
 Shi hear lowest Mars 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.130
 I am sure this is that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.130
 It is a general flashlight 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.720
 What or subspecies based on 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.170
 It looks good here, though 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.690
 This is about 3 meters ahead in this way 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 The irradiation range is also narrow 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.960
 Well, that's about the general thing 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.960
 I think 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.090
 But crowded I 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.320
 3 of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.460
 1607 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.460
 It is this brightness 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.900
 Scale More often looks now irradiation range is also very now 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 Very Kedomo it states that the spread was now 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.080
 It's not an award, but it's wide, so I can see it well 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.100
 Once you have a little 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 In further pinpoint a person of high happiness 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 Also to lend to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 I will 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.310
 It's a 30 meter old rice field 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.310
 I will often Mie 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.160
 Well I think that you can spread as rice depending on the application 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.060
 So it is this difference when comparing the general life 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.200
 It is completely different 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.800
 It is a mistake whether it is a shakume state 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.360
 Though it is explanation of mode 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.100
 It's that mirror mode now 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.710
 If you use the custom version 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.580
 Water removal mode 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.250
 We are achieving considerably in speed Le mode 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.030
 This is a weak mode by half pressing 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.290
 It bright dark before the war is called the Well ordinary taste even in a weak mood 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.150
 It is energy saving mode 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 Steam cast strobe 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.210
 Also cast 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.740
 This is s mode automatically 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.500
 It will sos mode in this kind of form 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.540
 Him and suddenly high mode but 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.360
 Pushing it off 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.930
 Soka 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.900
 In the form I 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.680
 The function that this half press can do is very 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.810
 Good usability 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:10.390
 I think it is 3 points 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:13.290
 Where it is very direct direct view to direct so that the amount of light is strong 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.750
 Do not irradiate to people and people 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.380
 Please take care 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.380
 Thank you very much
