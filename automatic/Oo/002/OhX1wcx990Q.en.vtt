rebuild<00:00:20.080> this<00:00:20.439> motor<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:21.520> split<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:21.880> cases

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
rebuild this motor we split the cases

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.460 
rebuild this motor we split the cases
put<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.570> new<00:00:22.689> crank<00:00:22.989> and<00:00:23.200> piston<00:00:23.710> rings<00:00:24.270> and<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
put a new crank and piston rings and it

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.690 
put a new crank and piston rings and it
has<00:00:26.590> enough<00:00:26.829> enough<00:00:28.410> full<00:00:29.410> exhaust<00:00:29.710> on<00:00:30.040> it<00:00:30.070> so

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
has enough enough full exhaust on it so

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.549 
has enough enough full exhaust on it so
I<00:00:30.759> just<00:00:31.059> went<00:00:31.750> through<00:00:31.809> this<00:00:32.050> car<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.439> make

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
I just went through this car to make

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.750 
I just went through this car to make
sure<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.980> jetting<00:00:33.340> was<00:00:34.440> correct<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
sure that the jetting was correct and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.810 
sure that the jetting was correct and
basically<00:00:37.120> I'm<00:00:37.330> comparing<00:00:37.690> it<00:00:37.900> right<00:00:38.170> off<00:00:38.350> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
basically I'm comparing it right off of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.650 
basically I'm comparing it right off of

on the bike I believe you can have
access<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.829> this<00:00:59.950> once<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.310> remove<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> seat

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
access to this once you remove the seat

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.389 
access to this once you remove the seat
in<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.090> tank<00:01:02.310> but<00:01:03.310> I<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:05.409> it<00:01:05.590> off<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:06.159> this

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
in the tank but I have it off on this

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.140 
in the tank but I have it off on this
workbench<00:01:06.729> here<00:01:06.939> so<00:01:08.820> let's<00:01:09.820> go<00:01:09.940> ahead<00:01:10.030> and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
workbench here so let's go ahead and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.630 
workbench here so let's go ahead and
remove<00:01:10.360> these<00:01:10.600> two<00:01:10.840> screws<00:01:17.340> alright<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.460> down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
remove these two screws alright and down

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.020 
remove these two screws alright and down
in<00:01:18.820> here<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:21.010> were<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.220> pull<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.790> throttle

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
in here if I were to pull the throttle

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.490 
in here if I were to pull the throttle
you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.850> see<00:01:25.120> this<00:01:25.299> this<00:01:25.810> nut<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.229> what<00:01:26.380> we

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
you can see this this nut is what we

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:39.480 
you can see this this nut is what we
have<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.710> remove<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:31.930> an<00:01:32.049> 8<00:01:32.170> mil

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.450 

basically<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.729> needle<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.359> little<00:01:41.840> leaner

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
basically this needle is a little leaner

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.529 
basically this needle is a little leaner
it's<00:01:43.460> kind<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.700> hard<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.909> understand<00:01:44.359> exactly

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's kind of hard to understand exactly

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.669 
it's kind of hard to understand exactly
by<00:01:45.020> from<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.439> charts<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:46.069> what<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.210> where

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
by from the charts of what and where

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.050 
by from the charts of what and where
it's<00:01:48.679> leaner<00:01:49.630> because<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:52.060> seems

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's leaner because it's in the seems

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.179 
it's leaner because it's in the seems
like<00:01:53.209> it's<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:53.450> little<00:01:53.719> leaner<00:01:53.979> richer<00:01:54.979> on<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
like it's a little leaner richer on the

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.999 
like it's a little leaner richer on the
bottom<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:55.670> leaner<00:01:55.850> up<00:01:56.060> top<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.920> don't<00:01:57.920> know

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
bottom but leaner up top I don't know

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.289 
bottom but leaner up top I don't know
that's<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.280> way<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> interpreted<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.030> anyway

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
that's the way I interpreted it anyway

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.699 
that's the way I interpreted it anyway
so<00:02:01.179> alright<00:02:02.179> so<00:02:02.359> here<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:05.349> and<00:02:06.349> what<00:02:06.619> you're

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
so alright so here it is and what you're

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:23.220 
so alright so here it is and what you're
going<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.890> want<00:02:07.039> to<00:02:07.069> do<00:02:07.219> is<00:02:07.340> remove<00:02:07.579> this<00:02:07.759> clip

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.910 

and<00:02:23.319> then<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.489> grab<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.940> whole<00:02:25.920> assembly

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and then just grab this whole assembly

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.390 
and then just grab this whole assembly
here<00:02:28.769> slide<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.220> new<00:02:30.370> one

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
here slide it on the new one

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.960 
here slide it on the new one
and<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:34.510> recommend<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.650> third<00:02:35.920> groove<00:02:39.480> so

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and they recommend the third groove so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.430 
and they recommend the third groove so
the<00:02:42.970> groove<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.420> always<00:02:43.780> counted<00:02:44.170> from<00:02:44.349> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
the groove is always counted from the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.620 
the groove is always counted from the
top

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
top

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.910 
top
so<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> first<00:02:46.959> groove<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.380> top<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
so the first groove at the top is the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.430 
so the first groove at the top is the
first<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.269> forth<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:49.870> want<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> put

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
first and so forth so we want to put

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:35.460 
first and so forth so we want to put
this<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.769> third<00:02:51.010> groove

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:04:04.070 

this<00:03:36.370> pyres<00:03:36.670> are<00:03:36.850> horrible<00:03:37.270> get<00:03:37.960> another<00:03:38.140> set

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.660 

alright<00:04:04.950> clip<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.520> there<00:04:05.640> just

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
alright clip that in there just

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.470 
alright clip that in there just
double-check<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:08.240> comparing<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.330> two

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
double-check and comparing the two
