regular old ipod and ipod touch and here

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.539 
regular old ipod and ipod touch and here
it<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.780> compared<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.350> an<00:03:12.470> iphone<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:18.400> there<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
it is compared to an iphone so there it

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.750 
it is compared to an iphone so there it
is<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.700> lot<00:03:20.209> smaller<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.370> going<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.640> be

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
is a lot smaller so that is going to be

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.190 
is a lot smaller so that is going to be
the<00:03:22.880> unboxing<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.780> new<00:03:23.810> ipod<00:03:24.739> shuffle
