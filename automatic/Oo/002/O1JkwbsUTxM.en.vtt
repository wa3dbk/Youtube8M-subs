00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 for all welcome to my channel one day 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.980
 more and from this video I bring you my routine 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 of makeup for spring my 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 favorite makeup in spring what 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 more I like to do myself that consists of the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.300
 very open look a very eyelash 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.519
 exaggerated mascara that's the way to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 outline my eye so you can see the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.010
 eye much more open a shadow very 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.439
 luminous a small delineated and then the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 face even though I have pimples and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.040
 I have to use a makeup 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.899
 a little opaque but that does not look 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.640
 Plasta sensation not a very makeup 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.850
 very bright the bronzer contour and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.460
 a lot of lighting a face very I do not know very 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 cool luminous I do not know how to call it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.750
 I will also show you what is the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 illuminator that I have been wearing that has 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.930
 become my favorites and I like it 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 very much 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 I also teach you a magic eyeliner 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.580
 that I have for the last little for 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.370
 lips so I do not know 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 do not run the lipstick off the lip in 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.010
 end what has been my makeup 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.200
 favorite in this era is what he sees the most 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 something when I have so a tad of time 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 so nothing that I hope you like 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 a lot and that I leave you with the video 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.470
 we'll start by putting a pre-base for 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 shadows to unify the eyelid and that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.380
 also the shadows last us much more 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.380
 without forming the creases 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.899
 I'm going to put a shadow on cream in color 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.640
 pink champagne with pretty glitter 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.640
 pretty bright 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.000
 and I make an outline with an eyeliner 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.220
 liquid and here I will see it like that without 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 much explanation as I do it since 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.170
 Mel has dressed a lot but if you want 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.110
 I can make a video counting the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.790
 tricks and how do I do it since it is a 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 little difficult because I have the eyelid 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 fallen 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 I pass my face and I'm going to start putting 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.790
 a green concealer in all the granites 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.790
 and red marquitas that I have 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.060
 is what are these two bases of makeup for 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.480
 get a high coverage but with 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.480
 lots of light 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.370
 I put illuminator in the places that go 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.590
 to see below that are points 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.630
 strategic to give much light to the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.320
 face and give volume and you do not see the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.320
 flat face 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.330
 with beauty blender he integrated it with the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.330
 makeup base 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.010
 fixed both the corrector of the area of ​​the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.010
 He looks like the whole face 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.300
 I do the contour to the areas I go to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.520
 see under the cheeks to make them 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.800
 more prominent and also on the edges 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.530
 of the face such as the jaw 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.060
 down and raising the temple towards 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.060
 up towards the forehead 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.650
 and I 'm going to tan with these pearls in 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.430
 the most prominent areas where we 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.430
 I would give more to the sun 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.400
 with a rouge in coral tone 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.970
 and then I put this illuminator 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.889
 that right now is my favorite and I 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.889
 like the effect that leaves 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.020
 and I'm also going to put a little bit for the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.020
 tear 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.690
 I'm going to delineate from the middle out 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.270
 and only by the line of the eyelashes 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.720
 We will leave the water line free 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.720
 in black 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.910
 happy in pink tone makeup we are going to 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.410
 delineate the entire water line and this does not 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.690
 will make the look but there will be 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.180
 much more with a mascara paralyze the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.180
 eyelashes another to give length 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.749
 and another to give volume 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.000
 I'm also going to attend a lot 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.000
 lower lashes 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.720
 plays a very important step that is to give 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.699
 a little bit of color and definition to 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.090
 our eyebrows to frame more the 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.090
 look 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.310
 and to finish on the lips first 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.690
 I'm going to put this magic eyeliner that 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.180
 it is so that it does not come out in life 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.640
 outside the contour of the lip that now 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.010
 this usually happens a lot and 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.620
 this eyeliner does not prevent us from 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.270
 go out where we put it and 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.010
 I 'm also going to put it 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.430
 all the lip because that's how we're going to 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:47.860
 get that I have not done lipstick be more 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.860
 waterproof and that lasts a lot more 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.100
 and finally I'm going to put my coral 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.580
 favorite that is this slip is super 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.580
 super nice 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.050
 and the berry would be our ready makeup 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.210
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.070
 down you will have little the links all my 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.270
 social networks as always and see you 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.270
