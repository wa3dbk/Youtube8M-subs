hello youtube this is MC unleashed and

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.800 
hello youtube this is MC unleashed and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.670 
today I'm going to show you how to make
flying<00:00:04.140> machines<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.950> Minecraft<00:00:05.940> 1.8<00:00:06.779> or<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
flying machines on Minecraft 1.8 or the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400 
flying machines on Minecraft 1.8 or the
snapshot<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.370> Minecraft<00:00:08.730> 1.8<00:00:09.330> these<00:00:10.260> will

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
snapshot for Minecraft 1.8 these will

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.290 
snapshot for Minecraft 1.8 these will
probably<00:00:10.530> work<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:10.980> Minecraft<00:00:11.519> 1.8<00:00:11.969> soon<00:00:12.240> as

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
probably work in Minecraft 1.8 soon as

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.360 
probably work in Minecraft 1.8 soon as
comes<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.110> don't<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.889> any<00:00:14.040> reason<00:00:14.280> why

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
comes out I don't see any reason why

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.000 
comes out I don't see any reason why
they<00:00:14.519> wouldn't<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.650> anyways<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.770> is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
they wouldn't but anyways this is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.150 
they wouldn't but anyways this is
Minecraft<00:00:18.000> 14<00:00:18.510> W<00:00:18.840> 32<00:00:19.230> B's<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.770> new<00:00:19.890> snapshot

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Minecraft 14 W 32 B's the new snapshot

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640 
Minecraft 14 W 32 B's the new snapshot
that<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.760> came<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:21.090> today<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.470> two

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that just came out today and the two

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.779 
that just came out today and the two
flying<00:00:22.920> machines<00:00:23.279> I'll<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.490> showing<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
flying machines I'll be showing you

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.320 
flying machines I'll be showing you
today<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:25.340> one<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.490> goes<00:00:26.670> straight<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.060> into

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
today are one that goes straight up into

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.189 
today are one that goes straight up into
the<00:00:27.420> sky<00:00:27.680> vertical<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.580> horizontal

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
the sky vertical one and the horizontal

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.479 
the sky vertical one and the horizontal
flying<00:00:31.199> machine<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.130> any<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
flying machine that can go in any of the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.940 
flying machine that can go in any of the
cardinal<00:00:32.850> directions<00:00:32.969> north<00:00:33.660> west<00:00:34.590> east

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
cardinal directions north west east

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.389 
cardinal directions north west east
south<00:00:35.840> anyways<00:00:36.840> here's<00:00:37.770> how<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.950> build<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
south anyways here's how you build the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
south anyways here's how you build the
horizontal<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.540> place<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.110> normal

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
horizontal one you just place a normal

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.410 
horizontal one you just place a normal
piston<00:00:40.980> make<00:00:41.370> sure<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.879> off<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> ground

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
piston make sure it's one off the ground

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
piston make sure it's one off the ground
so<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.230> sticky<00:00:43.559> pistons<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.250> touch<00:00:44.670> any

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so the sticky pistons don't touch any

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.940 
so the sticky pistons don't touch any
other<00:00:45.120> blocks<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:46.079> than<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> redstone

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
other blocks other than the redstone

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.630 
other blocks other than the redstone
blocks<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> place<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.039> slime

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
blocks and now you want to place a slime

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.389 
blocks and now you want to place a slime
block<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.750> spacing<00:00:52.289> away<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
block with one spacing away from the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.860 
block with one spacing away from the
piston<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:55.190> another<00:00:56.190> piston<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.449> spacing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
piston and another piston one spacing

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.920 
piston and another piston one spacing
away<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> facing<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> direction<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
away from it facing in the direction and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.650 
away from it facing in the direction and
now<00:01:00.930> slime<00:01:01.230> block<00:01:01.469> facing<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.359> another<00:01:03.359> sine

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
now slime block facing it another sine

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.530 
now slime block facing it another sine
block<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> front<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.939> piston

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
block on the front of the other piston

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
block on the front of the other piston
it<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.840> placed<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.520> then<00:01:08.520> blocks<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it just placed and then blocks the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
it just placed and then blocks the
redstone<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:12.140> now<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> sake<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
redstone on top and now for the sake of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.450 
redstone on top and now for the sake of
VM<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> ride<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> put

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you can put as many as 12 blocks on the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
you can put as many as 12 blocks on the
front<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

front of these you know just just the
default<00:01:25.080> limit<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> any<00:01:26.040> piston<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
default limit of any piston that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.289 
default limit of any piston that
includes<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> redstone<00:01:28.200> block<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.299> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
includes the redstone block here and of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
includes the redstone block here and of
course<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.659> slime<00:01:30.869> blocks<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> want

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
course the slime blocks now if you want

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
course the slime blocks now if you want
to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.090> started<00:01:33.509> there<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.840> many<00:01:33.990> different

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to get started there are many different

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
to get started there are many different
ways<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.060> use

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
ways you can do it you use you can use

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.649 
ways you can do it you use you can use
Flint<00:01:36.600> steel<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:38.420> redstone<00:01:39.420> torch

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
Flint steel you can use redstone torch

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
Flint steel you can use redstone torch
that<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:39.900> seen<00:01:40.079> people<00:01:40.170> use<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:41.490> I'm

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that I've seen people use that well I'm

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.620 
that I've seen people use that well I'm
just<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.119> blocks<00:01:42.570> redstone<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
just going to use blocks redstone and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
just going to use blocks redstone and
you<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.110> either<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.500> those<00:01:46.619> two

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you put it on either of those two

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
you put it on either of those two
Pistons<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> ready<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
Pistons and this is ready to go you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
Pistons and this is ready to go you
break<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> sake<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
break it now for the sake of just a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539 
break it now for the sake of just a
snapshot<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.140> face<00:01:55.439> away<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
snapshot you want to face away from the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.719 
snapshot you want to face away from the
flying<00:01:57.090> machine<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> will<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:59.520> much

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
flying machine that way it will go much

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
flying machine that way it will go much
faster<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.140> doesn't<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> render<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
faster so it doesn't have to render the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.249 
faster so it doesn't have to render the
animations<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> blocks<00:02:03.030> roll<00:02:03.869> probably

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
animations for the blocks roll probably

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.800 
animations for the blocks roll probably
still<00:02:04.409> does<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.540> conjecture

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
still does but this is just conjecture

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
still does but this is just conjecture
and<00:02:07.500> seems<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> work<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.759> better<00:02:08.789> when

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and seems to work much better when

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.260 
and seems to work much better when
facing<00:02:09.539> away<00:02:10.400> when<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.879> when

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
facing away when you want to get when

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.580 
facing away when you want to get when
you<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.020> stop<00:02:13.290> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you want to get it to stop you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.589 
you want to get it to stop you
just<00:02:13.769> break<00:02:13.980> any<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> redstone<00:02:15.300> blocks

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
just break any of the redstone blocks

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.809 
just break any of the redstone blocks
and<00:02:16.590> put<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.800> redstone<00:02:16.950> block<00:02:17.280> back<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and put the redstone block back and

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.589 
and put the redstone block back and
it'll<00:02:18.950> stay<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:19.980> place<00:02:20.300> until<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> put

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
it'll stay in place until you put

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.140 
it'll stay in place until you put
another<00:02:22.280> till<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> activate<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:23.970> these

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
another till you activate one of these

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.110 
another till you activate one of these
Pistons<00:02:25.019> here<00:02:25.519> anyways<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.910> moves

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
Pistons here anyways you can see moves

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
Pistons here anyways you can see moves
pretty<00:02:27.300> fast<00:02:27.420> moves<00:02:28.200> lot<00:02:28.440> faster<00:02:28.860> we're<00:02:29.010> not

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
pretty fast moves lot faster we're not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.330 
pretty fast moves lot faster we're not
sitting<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.550> top<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:33.950> anyway<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.010> I'm<00:02:35.190> going

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
sitting on top of it anyway so I'm going

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.650 
sitting on top of it anyway so I'm going
to<00:02:35.370> let<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.819> go<00:02:36.030> off<00:02:36.120> into<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.510> distance

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
to let that one go off into the distance

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.020 
to let that one go off into the distance
as<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.230> show<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:38.099> vertical<00:02:38.400> flying

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
as I show you the vertical flying

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710 
as I show you the vertical flying
machine<00:02:39.510> much<00:02:40.470> cooler<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.629> know

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
machine much cooler because you know

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.180 
machine much cooler because you know
going<00:02:43.140> straight<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> sky<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.950> could

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
going straight to the sky you could

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.539 
going straight to the sky you could
build<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.640> cool<00:02:45.090> castle<00:02:45.989> or<00:02:46.470> house<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> sky

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
build a cool castle or house on the sky

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.930 
build a cool castle or house on the sky
or<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:49.049> can<00:02:49.230> make<00:02:49.860> your<00:02:50.010> way<00:02:50.099> off<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> cavern

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
or you can make your way off a cavern

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.600 
or you can make your way off a cavern
like<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:52.019> one<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.980> know<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
like that one but you know that's I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.690 
like that one but you know that's I
credit<00:02:53.849> mode<00:02:54.829> anyways<00:02:55.829> how<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> build<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.640> of

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
credit mode anyways how to build one of

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.240 
credit mode anyways how to build one of
these<00:02:56.760> these<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.599> difficult

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
these these are a little more difficult

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.390 
these these are a little more difficult
place<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> piston<00:02:59.819> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.030> ground<00:03:00.329> facing<00:03:00.780> up

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
place the piston on the ground facing up

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.449 
place the piston on the ground facing up
slime<00:03:02.400> block<00:03:02.780> again<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:04.019> one<00:03:04.170> spacing<00:03:04.680> then

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
slime block again with one spacing then

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.930 
slime block again with one spacing then
another<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.879> on<00:03:05.970> top<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.209> one<00:03:06.569> off<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.500> side

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
another one on top and one off the side

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.220 
another one on top and one off the side
doesn't<00:03:08.940> matter<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:09.959> like

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
doesn't matter which that is I just like

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.410 
doesn't matter which that is I just like
to<00:03:10.319> put<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.739> side<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:12.030> then<00:03:12.239> whatever

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
to put it on the side and then whatever

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.600 
to put it on the side and then whatever
side<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.750> pick<00:03:12.900> put<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> block<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.829> redstone<00:03:13.980> on

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
side you pick put a block of redstone on

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.729 
side you pick put a block of redstone on
both<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.569> top<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.780> bottom<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.500> slime

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
both the top and bottom of that slime

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.569 
both the top and bottom of that slime
block<00:03:18.049> now<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.109> place<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.769> sticky<00:03:20.220> piston

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
block now you place a sticky piston

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.490 
block now you place a sticky piston
facing<00:03:20.730> down<00:03:22.069> right<00:03:23.069> next<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.730> now<00:03:24.500> with

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
facing down right next to it now with

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.990 
facing down right next to it now with
normal<00:03:25.799> piston<00:03:25.950> facing<00:03:26.250> up<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:29.579> sign<00:03:29.790> block

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
normal piston facing up and a sign block

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.780 
normal piston facing up and a sign block
on<00:03:30.180> top<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.079> then<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.739> black<00:03:32.280> redstone

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
on top of that and then a black redstone

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.110 
on top of that and then a black redstone
on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> side<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.670> again<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
on the side of that and again for the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.330 
on the side of that and again for the
sake<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.299> writing<00:03:36.599> it<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.109> going<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.530> build<00:03:37.889> a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
sake of writing it I'm going to build a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.110 
sake of writing it I'm going to build a
little<00:03:38.870> sitting<00:03:39.870> structure<00:03:43.250> again<00:03:44.250> carry<00:03:44.849> 12

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
little sitting structure again carry 12

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.539 
little sitting structure again carry 12
blocks<00:03:45.510> at<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> time<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.250> going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> build

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
blocks at a time so I'm going to build

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.650 
blocks at a time so I'm going to build
them<00:03:47.700> two<00:03:47.849> up<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.069> get<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.160> one<00:03:50.310> started

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
them two up and get this one started

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.420 
them two up and get this one started
again<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:51.900> put<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.349> black<00:03:52.739> redstone<00:03:53.220> on

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
again just put a black redstone on

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.569 
again just put a black redstone on
either<00:03:53.639> one<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> Pistons<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:55.160> I'm<00:03:56.160> getting

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
either one the Pistons and I'm getting

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.379 
either one the Pistons and I'm getting
on<00:03:56.760> top<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.359> this<00:03:57.650> break<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.769> block<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.389> watch

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
on top of this break the block and watch

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:10.130 
on top of this break the block and watch
it<00:04:00.630> take<00:04:00.810> me<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.530> sky

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.600 

yeah<00:04:11.140> sometimes<00:04:12.010> just<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.250> little<00:04:12.280> bit<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.580> a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
yeah sometimes just a little bit of a

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.030 
yeah sometimes just a little bit of a
problem<00:04:12.930> when<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.080> try<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.680> ride<00:04:14.860> them

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
problem when you try to ride them

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.259 
problem when you try to ride them
they'll<00:04:15.160> fall<00:04:15.880> off<00:04:15.910> or<00:04:16.390> fall<00:04:16.570> through<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
they'll fall off or fall through it

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.660 
they'll fall off or fall through it
hopefully<00:04:19.269> that'll<00:04:19.660> be<00:04:20.010> eradicated<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.190> the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
hopefully that'll be eradicated and the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.640 
hopefully that'll be eradicated and the
1.8<00:04:22.300> release<00:04:22.570> when<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.870> finally<00:04:23.020> gets<00:04:23.290> here

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
1.8 release when it finally gets here

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.080

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
but for now be wary of them because they

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.540 
but for now be wary of them because they

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
and they could very easily kill you so

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.490
