00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.500
 friends, hello, today we will talk 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 about average american tanchiki t95 not 2 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.110
 which by no means can 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.420
 buy for gold neither for silver it 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 can only get by bonus 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 program to invite a friend that is it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 when you throw a referral link 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.320
 to his comrade he pumps out 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 tank level 10 of course not without you and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 you immediately get this tanchik 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 wonderful of course he still has to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 buy it buy yourself a glass he 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 there sea days forehead and now we figure it out 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 is it worth playing with a newbie to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.079
 get this beautiful tank t-95 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 e2 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 Immediately proceed to the destroyed tank 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.530
 but I think you will be interested 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 see how it will be destroyed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 in the form here is such a scheme 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 destroyed Barbie yes she will 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.460
 there is always a tank of other schemes 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.949
 reservation of this tank is reserved 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 let's say so nicely because it has 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 very strong base for quite good ones 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.360
 ricochet angles will fly in all 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.549
 parties guys but here there is such here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.490
 turret commander which were on 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.890
 all tanks almost american 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 breaks me and many people because 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.290
 that it is above 11.5 per m103 per t32 and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.210
 so on guys that shoved with screens 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 we have better screens are good here they are 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 are in mask and here in general 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 almost knocking knocking 12 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.890
 millimeters but since this game is on we 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.409
 we understand what to punch here at all 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.899
 practically not important 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.030
 perhaps any projectile even 268 of 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.159
 Golda well there may be pass 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200
 Here we have in these wonderful 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.240
 guns here it is just shells 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.759
 through so here flies through 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.109
 and nothing happens to us with tanchika 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.369
 undefeat they sub 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.579
 that we have nld in nld we have only a hundred 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.119
 four millimeters but at what angle 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.399
 ld are located 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.689
 this is understandable because it will break through 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.789
 pretty there 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.799
 from the vine well one hundred and four millimeters for 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.959
 tanks of the eighth level is what can be 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.720
 at seven and six that will be 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.329
 sometimes fly to us will receive 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 bounce and non-penetration but the rest 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:17.269
 Tanks 9 and 8 of course will 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.379
 speed punch around vld this 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.349
 that's straight wasps. 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.780
 we have 114 millimeters also we 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.340
 on the towers girl. 14 millimeters but 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 turret on with good angles and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 ricochet will turrets can not 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.930
 to come back as clear 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.489
 panel or bad here it is not here at all 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 punch the same way we have such here 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.720
 screens that just dump from the dumps and 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.000
 do not miss but very much further 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.489
 interesting things but they are more like 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 the texture is usually not shown on them 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.310
 millimeter no completely harp with us 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.799
 have 20 millimeters in a water tub 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 planting very well see again 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.250
 angle and leglight damage 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.910
 goes through 2 likes and so will he 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.669
 pass with him and the hijacking is also quite good 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 he will tank his shells 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.230
 ricochets will move away from him in 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.840
 principle tanchik well armored and but 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.780
 again look there are such a dream and 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.669
 there is a good way to punch this place 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.790
 just and from the arts will fly and from more 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.889
 heavy and tall tanks will be here 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.810
 make your way because in small 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.090
 I danced in a little way 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.280
 Yes, for example, a Christmas tree is such a tank as 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.530
 kv-5 just look at it like this 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.569
 bummer you always break through again 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.030
 us over the mask of such a space 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.359
 which can punch a total of 71 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.989
 63 millimeters and here we also have 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.500
 on 63 millimeters here we have this zone 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.070
 only 55 millimeters like this 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.489
 weak spots 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.829
 again here is about bk 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.850
 commander turret we have 76 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.340
 millimeters of armor 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.289
 that is , it may not always penetrate 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.979
 again bounce zone here 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.620
 not bad 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:06.859
 and machine gun which is very weak 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.530
 we only have 25 millimeters from both 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.989
 sides but here are his front zones here 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.299
 these they will also keep some 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.329
 shells as you see this is the rebound zone 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.329
 and tanchik will trade well boards 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.739
 Well Goofy get out of it is very bad here 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.139
 so it all looks 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.419
 normal time now we take a look 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.490
 his tth and fight since 1954 in the us not 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.470
 I leave hope to surpass the Soviet 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.039
 all tanks start 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.580
 development of two cars at once is t95 five 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 rinks 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.130
 90mm guns and 396 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.340
 6 map and 105 millimeter guns 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.550
 later the military agreed to unite 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.740
 projects called t95 from later still 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.710
 some time turned out to be completely 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.539
 from him due to flaws in front of m 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.910
 482 tantra 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.440
 despite this several cars were 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.900
 built in metal 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.600
 and now we talk to you about 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.139
 technical parameters of this machine when 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.400
 95 barely 90 millimeter guns at 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.110
 Van had a good minus 10 plus 20 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.990
 maximum speed of 56 kilometers per 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:24.020
 an hour ahead and 21 kilometers an hour ago 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.300
 review of 390 meters damage per minute 2085 a 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.180
 average damage per shot we have is 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.410
 240 sponge 2 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.449
 tesoro golden and 320 bombs when we 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:39.580
 just 7 seconds with 100 percent 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:41.410
 crew accuracy before was 0.3 time 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180
 data only 2 seconds 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.720
 armor penetration one hundred seventy three 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.210
 millimeters butterflies and 242 gold 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.800
 armor penetration of course butterflies low 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.889
 everyone will play this tank and 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.139
 goldie but on this basis it is worth believing 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.470
 the fact that the tank does not fly tenth level 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.520
 Here we have such lovers and baby if 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.160

 thank you all guys bye bye 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.300
 in October 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.300
 valley 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.389
 Yes 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.540
 but
