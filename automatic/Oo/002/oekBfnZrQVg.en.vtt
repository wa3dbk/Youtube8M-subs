00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
besides the stock which i think is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
besides the stock which i think is
really<00:00:58.859> cool<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> went<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> two<00:00:59.940> bottom

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
really cool so I went for the two bottom

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
really cool so I went for the two bottom
ones<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.170> exhaust<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.370> overall

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
ones the exhaust there if for overall

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
ones the exhaust there if for overall
there<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.510> drill<00:01:03.750> exit<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> dual

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
there is the drill exit the dual

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.340 
there is the drill exit the dual
titanium<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> overly<00:01:06.330> exhaust<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.170> race

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
titanium the overly exhaust and the race

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
titanium the overly exhaust and the race
exhaust<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> went<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.240> dual

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
exhaust I think I went for the dual

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320 
exhaust I think I went for the dual
titanium<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.670> probably<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.210> for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
titanium in this one I probably go for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
titanium in this one I probably go for
the<00:01:12.450> race<00:01:12.630> exhaust<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> had<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> unlocked

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the race exhaust if I had it unlocked

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
the race exhaust if I had it unlocked
now<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> grille<00:01:15.060> customization<00:01:15.840> isn't<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> lot

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
now the grille customization isn't a lot

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
now the grille customization isn't a lot
it<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.860> gives<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> option<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.580> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it just gives you the option to have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
it just gives you the option to have
that<00:01:18.150> big<00:01:18.360> badge<00:01:18.600> grille<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.020> front<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that big badge grille in the front so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
that big badge grille in the front so
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> either<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you can either have that or not have it

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
you can either have that or not have it
talk<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.659> hood<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.080> only<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
talk to you the hood there's only the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
talk to you the hood there's only the
option<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.310> carbon<00:01:23.670> hood<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.540> think

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
option to have a carbon hood I think

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
option to have a carbon hood I think
later<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.490> only

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
later I put it on because there's only

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
later I put it on because there's only
one<00:01:26.939> primary<00:01:27.330> colour<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> added<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.290> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
one primary colour so I added it to have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
one primary colour so I added it to have
another<00:01:28.829> color<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> roll<00:01:30.119> cage<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> a

and there's a carbon I think I changed

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
and there's a carbon I think I changed
again<00:01:38.520> later<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.329> skirt<00:01:39.689> says<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
again later the skirt says to there's a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.730 
again later the skirt says to there's a
custom<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> custom<00:01:42.299> -<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.840> went<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
custom one in custom - I went for the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.899 
custom one in custom - I went for the
bottom<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.159> chose<00:01:44.310> better

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
bottom one I chose better

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
bottom one I chose better
now<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> spoiler<00:01:45.689> there's<00:01:45.990> three<00:01:46.290> there's<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
now the spoiler there's three there's a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
now the spoiler there's three there's a
dog<00:01:46.829> tail<00:01:47.040> spoiler<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.759> high<00:01:48.329> level<00:01:48.570> spoiler

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
dog tail spoiler a high level spoiler

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.679 
dog tail spoiler a high level spoiler
and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> carbon<00:01:49.740> win<00:01:49.950> wing<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.509> went

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and the carbon win wing I think I went

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
and the carbon win wing I think I went
for<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.530> high<00:01:52.770> level<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
for the high level here but I think I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
for the high level here but I think I
changed<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.420> carbon<00:01:54.810> later<00:01:55.049> after<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
changed it to the carbon later after I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
changed it to the carbon later after I
did<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> colour<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> said<00:01:57.810> before

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
did the colour so as I said before

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
did the colour so as I said before
there's<00:01:58.320> only<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.860> colors<00:01:59.280> only<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.520> primary

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
there's only one colors only a primary

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's only one colors only a primary
color<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.689> my<00:02:00.840> car<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.140> went<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> matte

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
color and for my car I went for a matte

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.670 
color and for my car I went for a matte
red<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.670> thought<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.780> looked<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.229> nice<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
red I thought it looked really nice and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
red I thought it looked really nice and
I<00:02:05.100> went<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.460> decided<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.149> change<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> later

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
I went and decided to change it later

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.290 
I went and decided to change it later
and<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.920> carbon<00:02:08.190> hood<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> carbon

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and put the carbon hood and the carbon

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.270 
and put the carbon hood and the carbon
roof<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.959> also<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> carbon<00:02:10.679> wing<00:02:11.069> on

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
roof and I think also the carbon wing on

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.370 
roof and I think also the carbon wing on
the<00:02:12.090> spoiler

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the spoiler

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.750 
the spoiler
and<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.070> could<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.580> like

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and that's just so I could have like

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400 
and that's just so I could have like
that<00:02:14.970> customization<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.930> looked<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.230> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that customization it looked like this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.530 
that customization it looked like this
kind<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.830> two<00:02:17.010> colors<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.390> thought

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
kind of two colors on it and I thought

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
kind of two colors on it and I thought
it<00:02:18.630> looked<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.080> nice<00:02:19.290> after<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.040> fall<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
it looked really nice after I fall the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.610 
it looked really nice after I fall the
tires<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.420> liked<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.900> original<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
tires I kind of liked the original so I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080 
tires I kind of liked the original so I
went<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:22.950> something<00:02:23.130> similar<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.790> went<00:02:23.940> for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
went for something similar and went for

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.270 
went for something similar and went for
the<00:02:24.180> synthetic<00:02:24.540> Zed's<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> color<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the synthetic Zed's and for the color I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.560 
the synthetic Zed's and for the color I
was<00:02:26.340> gonna<00:02:26.460> go<00:02:26.610> black<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> decided<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> go

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
was gonna go black but I decided to go

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.300 
was gonna go black but I decided to go
with<00:02:27.600> carbon<00:02:28.230> black<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.860> matches<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
with carbon black just so it matches the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.220 
with carbon black just so it matches the
hood<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> roof<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> spoiler<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
hood the roof and the spoiler and I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.600 
hood the roof and the spoiler and I
think<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.500> turned<00:02:31.710> out<00:02:31.800> looking<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.220> nice

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
think it turned out looking really nice

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.730 
think it turned out looking really nice
overall<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> benefactor

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
overall so that was the benefactor

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.530 
overall so that was the benefactor
