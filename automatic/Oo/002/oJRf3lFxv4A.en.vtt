00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 In this video tutorial I would like 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 show the one inside powerpoint 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 slides from powerpoint 1 into the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.289
 So powerpoint 2-coup can be yours 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 can take over without the format 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 the output film loses so 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 usually if you have such a foil 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.390
 I copy myself, for example 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 here's the first slide here 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.840
 online presentation home press the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.489
 mouse button hold the key and drag 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.899
 the in my new presentation 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.960
 because of me here second 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 the following happens i only have now 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.530
 another white page or in white 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.379
 background of the film because here the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.239
 original formatting of this foil set 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.579
 it's taken over here like you 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.070
 master slide is designed that will 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.399
 Now I can take care of it 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.530
 correct and tell the background 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.830
 but should be black as in slide 1 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 but I can do it quite differently 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.650
 That said, so you can do it here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 after correcting by saying 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.299
 background format and put that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.890
 then turn black here and close 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 that and then have it here, so to speak 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 my original color is made it works 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 but also easier by having one here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 foil or all slides take that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 I'll do it I like you all 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.500
 foil and put this on me too 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.920
 Let's say the first position is quiet 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.710
 and what's going on here 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 all foils in it all foils price so 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.149
 do not want what and powerpoint gives 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000
 here is a little help namely here 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.380
 down because we are up there too 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.369
 but it will be here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 automatically fades in this little one 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.780
 clipboard there I can on the arrow 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.530
 click and say original here 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 retain formatting 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.140
 click and zack now I can see here 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.459
 my copied slides in the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.110
 background formatting and the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.780
 other formatting such as 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 example also font and the like 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.690
 just like in the exit 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.690
 film set
