00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
but it's number 20 game the second thing

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.400 
but it's number 20 game the second thing
is<00:06:51.240> this<00:06:51.720> was<00:06:51.990> cold<00:06:52.380> from<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:52.949> list<00:06:53.190> of<00:06:53.810> 40<00:06:54.810> games
