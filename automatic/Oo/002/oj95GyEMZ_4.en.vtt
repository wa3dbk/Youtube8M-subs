naturally<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:23.170> ask<00:02:23.380> questions<00:02:23.590> where<00:02:24.459> did<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
naturally will ask questions where did I

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.780 
naturally will ask questions where did I
come<00:02:25.000> from<00:02:25.060> why<00:02:25.510> did<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> happen<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
come from why did that happen and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.810 
come from why did that happen and
Dominic<00:02:27.790> will<00:02:28.000> ask<00:02:28.240> why<00:02:28.840> did<00:02:29.110> my<00:02:29.290> mummy<00:02:29.820> not

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
Dominic will ask why did my mummy not

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.070 
Dominic will ask why did my mummy not
look<00:02:31.030> after<00:02:31.240> me<00:02:31.540> properly

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
look after me properly

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.110 
look after me properly
and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.980> explain<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.640> him<00:02:33.820> what

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
and I have to explain to him what

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.810 
and I have to explain to him what
happened<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.990> why<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:36.070> necessary<00:02:36.700> for

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
happened and why it was necessary for

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.260 
happened and why it was necessary for
him<00:02:37.150> not<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.780> stay<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.320> his<00:02:38.530> mum<00:02:38.800> because<00:02:39.340> God

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
him not to stay with his mum because God

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.790 
him not to stay with his mum because God
honestly<00:02:40.660> he<00:02:40.930> knows<00:02:41.140> he<00:02:41.440> wouldn't<00:02:41.739> have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
honestly he knows he wouldn't have

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.790 
honestly he knows he wouldn't have
survived<00:02:42.190> if<00:02:42.580> he'd<00:02:42.790> stayed<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.410> and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
survived if he'd stayed there and and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.729 
survived if he'd stayed there and and
that's<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.220> sad<00:02:45.489> fact<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:46.570> he<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.380> hid<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
that's a sad fact but if he if we hid it

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.300 
that's a sad fact but if he if we hid it
from<00:02:47.950> him

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
from him

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.990 
from him
that<00:02:49.120> will<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.630> unnatural<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.950> wrong<00:02:51.340> because

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
that will be unnatural and wrong because

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.780 
that will be unnatural and wrong because
he<00:02:52.150> wouldn't<00:02:52.450> then<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:53.620> why<00:02:53.950> he<00:02:54.310> came<00:02:54.550> into

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
he wouldn't then know why he came into

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.220 
he wouldn't then know why he came into
care<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> first<00:02:55.540> place

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
care in the first place

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.460 
care in the first place
we<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.209> been<00:02:58.209> through<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.600> process<00:02:58.810> twice

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
we have been through the process twice

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.880 
we have been through the process twice
and<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.520> hard<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.239> difficult<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.380> having

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
and it is hard and difficult but having

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.510 
and it is hard and difficult but having
had<00:03:03.040> birth<00:03:03.280> children<00:03:03.550> as<00:03:03.910> well<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:06.250> say

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
had birth children as well I would say

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.490 
had birth children as well I would say
it<00:03:06.730> was<00:03:06.940> probably<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.450> an<00:03:07.900> equal<00:03:08.610> setting<00:03:09.610> of

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it was probably on an equal setting of

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.740 
it was probably on an equal setting of
difficulties<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.950> suppose<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.090> second<00:03:13.510> time

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
difficulties I suppose the second time

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.240 
difficulties I suppose the second time
it<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.080> little<00:03:14.260> bit<00:03:14.500> harder<00:03:14.920> because<00:03:15.040> we

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
it was a little bit harder because we

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.259 
it was a little bit harder because we
were<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.519> little<00:03:15.610> bit<00:03:16.000> older<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:18.040> think<00:03:18.850> we

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
were a little bit older and I think we

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.800 
were a little bit older and I think we
felt<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.989> we<00:03:20.739> would<00:03:21.040> probably<00:03:21.940> not<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.540> able

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
felt that we would probably not be able

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.300 
felt that we would probably not be able
to<00:03:23.049> adopt<00:03:23.950> if<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:25.720> were<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.080> our<00:03:26.230> 50s<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.160> that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to adopt if we were in our 50s but that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.690 
to adopt if we were in our 50s but that
proved<00:03:27.610> not<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.820> be<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> case<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.980> social

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
proved not to be the case and the social

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.210 
proved not to be the case and the social
services<00:03:31.090> at<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.390> time<00:03:31.420> seemed<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.049> feel<00:03:32.410> that

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
services at the time seemed to feel that

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.120 
services at the time seemed to feel that
it<00:03:33.370> was<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:34.090> right<00:03:34.269> thing<00:03:34.329> for<00:03:34.720> Dominic<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.980> be

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
it was the right thing for Dominic to be

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.600 
it was the right thing for Dominic to be
adopted<00:03:36.340> by<00:03:37.209> us<00:03:37.450> who<00:03:38.230> he<00:03:38.410> knew<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.100> he<00:03:39.130> loved

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
adopted by us who he knew and he loved

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.400 
adopted by us who he knew and he loved
and<00:03:39.940> was<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> well-loved<00:03:40.750> member<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.230> our

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
and was a well-loved member of our

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.650 
and was a well-loved member of our
family<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.459> was<00:03:42.519> absolutely<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.390> right

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
family so it was absolutely the right

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.360 
family so it was absolutely the right
thing<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:44.019> do<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:45.190> our<00:03:46.980> fostering<00:03:47.980> career

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
thing to do in our fostering career

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.610 
thing to do in our fostering career
we've<00:03:48.700> fostered<00:03:49.030> many<00:03:49.900> children<00:03:50.410> from

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
we've fostered many children from

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.680 
we've fostered many children from
different<00:03:50.920> races<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:53.640> we've<00:03:54.640> we've<00:03:55.180> enjoyed

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
different races and we've we've enjoyed

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.920 
different races and we've we've enjoyed
and<00:03:56.170> learned<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.950> much<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.640> yet<00:03:58.540> these

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
and learned so much and yet these

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.340 
and learned so much and yet these
children<00:03:59.410> have<00:04:00.239> sort<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.329> been<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:01.690> care<00:04:02.019> for

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
children have sort of been in care for

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.560 
children have sort of been in care for
so<00:04:02.500> long<00:04:02.769> because<00:04:03.070> they've<00:04:03.370> been<00:04:03.579> found<00:04:03.910> an

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
so long because they've been found an

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.080 
so long because they've been found an
appropriate<00:04:05.200> placement<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:06.400> now<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.670> think

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
appropriate placement but now I think

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.810 
appropriate placement but now I think
it's<00:04:07.540> changing<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.410> people<00:04:08.860> are<00:04:09.310> actually

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
it's changing and people are actually

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.360 
it's changing and people are actually
being<00:04:10.480> able<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.840> adopt<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.709> children<00:04:12.190> that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
being able to adopt the children that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.110 
being able to adopt the children that
they

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
they

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.009 
they
perhaps<00:04:13.780> fostered<00:04:14.319> or<00:04:14.500> they<00:04:14.709> know<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:16.019> and

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
perhaps fostered or they know and and

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.659 
perhaps fostered or they know and and
the<00:04:17.169> children<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:17.799> be<00:04:18.010> placed<00:04:18.310> with

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
the children can be placed with

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.879 
the children can be placed with
different<00:04:19.060> ways<00:04:19.239> families<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.530> be<00:04:20.650> able<00:04:20.769> to

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
different ways families to be able to

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.890 
different ways families to be able to
turn<00:04:21.130> around<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.760> say<00:04:22.000> I've<00:04:22.510> actually

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
turn around and say I've actually

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.050 
turn around and say I've actually
changed<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.919> person's<00:04:24.130> life<00:04:24.639> from<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
changed that person's life from the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.390 
changed that person's life from the
course<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:26.199> that<00:04:26.410> would<00:04:26.590> take<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
course that that would take for the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.800 
course that that would take for the
better<00:04:28.289> it's<00:04:29.289> really<00:04:29.740> really<00:04:30.130> very<00:04:30.340> rewarding

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
better it's really really very rewarding

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.080 
better it's really really very rewarding
but<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.139> Dominic<00:04:32.650> who<00:04:32.860> was<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.370> close<00:04:33.669> to

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090
