happens to how games get designed then

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.830

and three times and the experimenters

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.460 
and three times and the experimenters
wanted<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.000> see<00:02:59.150> how<00:02:59.390> many<00:02:59.450> times<00:02:59.989> people

would push the bar and ended up being
thousands<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:03.980> thousands<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.489> times<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.239> as

Benny Bennett brought up the the games
you<00:03:08.569> see<00:03:08.599> like<00:03:08.930> something<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.230> Tiny<00:03:09.500> Tower

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
you see like something like Tiny Tower

you see like something like Tiny Tower
something<00:03:10.340> are<00:03:10.489> essentially<00:03:11.230> exact<00:03:12.230> replicas

of these behavioral models that were

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.890 
of these behavioral models that were
built<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.639> sort<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:16.940> wonder<00:03:17.090> why<00:03:17.690> would

built and you sort of wonder why would

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.180 
built and you sort of wonder why would
you<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.169> that<00:03:18.200> why<00:03:18.500> are<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.709> doing<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you do that why are you doing that to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.500 
you do that why are you doing that to
your<00:03:19.340> player<00:03:19.609> do<00:03:19.849> you<00:03:19.880> really<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.389> be<00:03:20.480> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
your player do you really want to be a

your player do you really want to be a

now<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.590> other<00:03:24.859> thing<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.250> brings<00:03:25.519> me<00:03:25.639> to<00:03:25.790> is

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
now the other thing this brings me to is

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.330 
now the other thing this brings me to is
that<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.299> all<00:03:26.419> know<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.440> only<00:03:28.099> about

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
that we all know that that only about

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.680 
that we all know that that only about
five<00:03:28.669> percent<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.180> people<00:03:29.269> who<00:03:29.480> play

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
five percent of the people who play

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.330 
five percent of the people who play
these<00:03:29.870> games<00:03:30.079> actually<00:03:30.440> spend<00:03:30.950> all<00:03:31.099> of<00:03:31.129> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
these games actually spend all of the

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
that's when you start monetizing I would

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.740 
that's when you start monetizing I would
suggest<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.669> there<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.419> moral

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
suggest that this is there is moral

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.449 
suggest that this is there is moral
culpability<00:03:59.930> here<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:00.919> not<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.099> good

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
culpability here this is not a good

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.789 
culpability here this is not a good
thing<00:04:01.699> to<00:04:01.760> be<00:04:02.030> engaging<00:04:02.389> in<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.379> other<00:04:03.530> thing

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
thing to be engaging in the other thing

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.050 
thing to be engaging in the other thing
that<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:03.949> would<00:04:04.040> point<00:04:04.310> out<00:04:04.549> is<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:04.970> probably

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
that I would point out is it's probably

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.089 
that I would point out is it's probably
not<00:04:05.359> good<00:04:05.599> for<00:04:05.629> game<00:04:06.019> design<00:04:06.410> right<00:04:06.769> do<00:04:07.040> you

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
not good for game design right do you

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.949 
not good for game design right do you
really<00:04:07.370> want<00:04:07.669> to<00:04:07.730> be<00:04:07.819> designing<00:04:08.150> games<00:04:08.449> where

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
really want to be designing games where

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.099 
really want to be designing games where
the<00:04:09.560> game<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:10.160> boring<00:04:10.519> or<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.150> slow<00:04:11.569> or<00:04:11.959> so

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
the game is so boring or so slow or so

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.509 
the game is so boring or so slow or so
repetitive<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.889> people<00:04:13.160> are<00:04:13.250> willing<00:04:13.280> to

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
repetitive that people are willing to

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.460 
repetitive that people are willing to
pay<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.359> be<00:04:14.449> like<00:04:14.599> released<00:04:15.079> into

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
pay you to be like released into

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.069 
pay you to be like released into
something<00:04:15.829> more<00:04:16.010> exciting<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:17.570> think<00:04:17.930> that

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
something more exciting I think that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.319 
something more exciting I think that
it's<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.560> bad<00:04:18.739> idea

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
it's a bad idea

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.599 
it's a bad idea
so<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.049> kind<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.349> comes<00:04:20.530> back<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:21.069> the<00:04:21.310> the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
so it kind of comes back to the the

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.490 
so it kind of comes back to the the
thing<00:04:21.819> about<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.270> saloon<00:04:22.870> keepers<00:04:23.319> in<00:04:23.439> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
thing about the saloon keepers in the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.050 
thing about the saloon keepers in the
beginning<00:04:23.650> right<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.069> put<00:04:24.370> out<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.610> question

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
beginning right I put out this question

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.240 
beginning right I put out this question
like<00:04:25.270> they're<00:04:25.750> diametrically<00:04:26.409> opposed<00:04:26.830> a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
like they're diametrically opposed a

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.429 
like they're diametrically opposed a
good<00:04:27.490> business<00:04:27.969> or<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.750> know<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.020> maybe<00:04:29.229> it's

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
good business or you know but maybe it's

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.589 
good business or you know but maybe it's
bad<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.979> I<00:04:30.069> would<00:04:30.250> say<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.759> this<00:04:31.210> trend

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
bad and I would say that this this trend

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.740 
bad and I would say that this this trend
is<00:04:31.870> actually<00:04:32.439> not<00:04:33.009> only<00:04:33.069> perhaps<00:04:34.060> morally

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
is actually not only perhaps morally

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.510 
is actually not only perhaps morally
reprehensible<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.860> actually<00:04:36.250> going<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.430> be

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
reprehensible but actually going to be

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.219 
reprehensible but actually going to be
bad<00:04:36.729> for<00:04:36.759> business<00:04:37.150> if<00:04:37.569> you<00:04:37.719> end<00:04:37.900> up<00:04:37.990> designing

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
bad for business if you end up designing

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.740 
bad for business if you end up designing
down<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.039> whole<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:40.090> feeding<00:04:40.330> people

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
down the whole of just feeding people

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.390 
down the whole of just feeding people
into<00:04:41.139> addiction<00:04:41.409> loops<00:04:41.800> rather<00:04:42.129> than

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
into addiction loops rather than

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.999 
into addiction loops rather than
creating<00:04:42.789> experiences<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.900> are<00:04:43.960> rich<00:04:44.830> and

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
creating experiences that are rich and

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.640 
creating experiences that are rich and
meaningful<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.789> them<00:04:45.849> okay<00:04:46.810> my<00:04:47.110> time<00:04:47.319> is<00:04:47.530> up
