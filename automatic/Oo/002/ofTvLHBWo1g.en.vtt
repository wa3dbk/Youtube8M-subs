00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.300
 now hot but was programmed by 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.360
 and I'll show you guys "on request 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.180
 the explorative next 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.650
 nobody could 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.040
 he drove frontally into a studio recorded videos on YouTube 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.199
 uploaded 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.480
 From this, we thought to make an overview of their address 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.359
 and then it could be 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.419
 So first he opened the fight on the recorder 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.000
 Doing so much with your whole I've already felt that here now 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.720
 hit 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.599
 click here on the city Bernern 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.619
 Stop Castor 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.190
 and if you make dust automatically it will change for a long time 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.710
 could you 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 down on 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.360
 on soft Baroin sounds 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 if you do that then Quanta opens the studio the whole thing will be 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670
 was I look like that 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.399
 Dirk, this beer is already full 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.390
 here it only has a two seconds 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.340
 and l that was easy for me to show right now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.630
 should keep 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.820
 OK 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.310
 now he's got that in your mind 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.420
 and then this one goes 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.310
 Produce on top of it and carry it on everyone 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 and then could be here 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 besides, where you produce that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.680
 now there are different possibilities one sooner 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 Coach Torsten has Dr 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 the whole thing goes the line 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.660
 he will see very much where to save 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.830
 but if we remember the whole thing, I do not need it now 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 and then you can resort to feature book state law and Theo yet 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.190
 and then it could still work 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 Publish YouTube directly 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 For this he goes to publish on YouTube 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.850
 goes on too 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 Peter were received and expensive 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.299
 or password 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.299
 to 7 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 it's still going on here 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 and prince ever enter title and description and stuff but need it now 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.550
 I would go now 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.910
 it would not matter because the brain and it is then year then finish 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.070
 so that uploaded 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.449
 that is only then fast again 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.299
 File and how long the video takes because the Erlanger that too high to load 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.759
 new CD any unnamed 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.870
 who still processes all this now 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.890
 the 7 video with once uploaded and all drivers held 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.919
 OK 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.739
 the whole so that it ever shows 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.290
 and then there is still custom production setting 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.899
 that it's easy to shoot at the computer then 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.599
 I would be the mp4 it was Erfurt that 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.439
 that's just that it's the fastest uploading on YouTube 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.960
 the wife and Aribert Heim, above all, we have achieved 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.749
 Massenheim spokesman 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.499
 and that will take a long time for Russia to do that 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.590
 Problem of the masses in the fourth place I too my friend 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.129
 yes still goes on 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.769
 again on again as he himself it was not examined 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.629
 the excuse memory gets 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.189
 then on completions 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.149
 I mean that's always gone 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.649
 but then a preview is displayed 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.389
 do not finish the tree and finish it 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.239
 eg that they are made 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.149
 PS I have to be able to pro for a short time 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.579
 e-reader 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.579
 Now I show I still lie the exact program 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.029
 and you have to register with you king and 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 Upload Guitar Hero video 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.070
 and if he wants that who clicked on it 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.799
 GBP on the husband video footage 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.680
 and he had to come in well that saved i have that here now 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.059
 on the top 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.310
 Suters just around 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.310
 Dr and when it hits it jams 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 with increasing 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.139
 and now 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.519
 Such approaches are the whole thing if you also custom 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.169
 attitude 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 Upload percent heads 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.059
 it's okay 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.260
 so they are just appointed 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.009
 and because the NPD of many parts 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.860
 SWF cracks receipt for the Internet thought that are also mostly on the spot 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.670
 which he recognized as advertising 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.830
 they have the magazine appears 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.020
 Year Homburger punk band the FIA 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.009
 I will turn around now and this will stay that way for me is completely 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:37.740
 fast 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.340
 Enschede could call that description tax and category and so on 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.139
 hereby men private because I sit throb 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.300
 Dr that 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.599
 that looks like it still processed and then the device is still ready 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.189
 that is, in principle already now I have shown the whole thing 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.710
 actually upload 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.900
 is unclear 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.830
 and what in principle then already at the mersch 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.200
 we still have the question if we have our videos now 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.639
 both saw the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.300
 to upload 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.430
 whether Wilders percent would find better dollar squeeze that does not matter 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.789
 good that a penalty from me then to St
