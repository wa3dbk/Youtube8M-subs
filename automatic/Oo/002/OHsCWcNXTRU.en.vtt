00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
androids appeared during the course of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.990 
androids appeared during the course of
this<00:01:39.170> cell<00:01:39.470> had<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.770> regress<00:01:40.130> into<00:01:40.340> his<00:01:40.549> larval

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
this cell had to regress into his larval

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.609 
this cell had to regress into his larval
state<00:01:41.270> because<00:01:41.570> otherwise<00:01:41.990> he<00:01:42.290> wouldn't<00:01:42.560> have

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
state because otherwise he wouldn't have

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.590 
state because otherwise he wouldn't have
been<00:01:42.740> able<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.250> fit<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.790> time<00:01:44.060> machine<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
been able to fit in the time machine and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840 
been able to fit in the time machine and
so<00:01:44.840> cell<00:01:45.140> being<00:01:45.409> similar<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.979> cicada<00:01:46.369> had<00:01:46.729> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
so cell being similar to a cicada had to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.730 
so cell being similar to a cicada had to
burrow<00:01:47.060> deep<00:01:47.390> underground<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.290> regain

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
burrow deep underground and regain

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.499 
burrow deep underground and regain
enough<00:01:48.890> strength<00:01:49.430> where<00:01:49.700> he<00:01:49.850> could<00:01:50.030> turn<00:01:50.240> back

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
enough strength where he could turn back

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.990 
enough strength where he could turn back
into<00:01:50.780> his<00:01:50.990> imperfect<00:01:51.770> form<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:52.579> case<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
into his imperfect form in this case the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.300 
into his imperfect form in this case the
plan<00:01:53.210> question<00:01:53.930> arises<00:01:54.439> once<00:01:54.680> piccolo<00:01:55.100> asked

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
plan question arises once piccolo asked

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.039 
plan question arises once piccolo asked
cell<00:01:55.640> how<00:01:55.850> he<00:01:55.909> knew<00:01:56.180> how<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.390> use<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> time

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
cell how he knew how to use the time

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.810 
cell how he knew how to use the time
machine<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.619> why<00:01:57.770> he<00:01:57.950> went<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.460> year

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
machine and why he went to that year

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.789 
machine and why he went to that year
specifically<00:01:59.479> at<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.960> point<00:02:00.259> cell<00:02:00.530> tells

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
specifically at this point cell tells

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.469 
specifically at this point cell tells
piccolo<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.460> trunks<00:02:01.790> had<00:02:01.909> already<00:02:02.090> set<00:02:02.450> up

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
piccolo that trunks had already set up

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.270 
piccolo that trunks had already set up
the<00:02:02.689> time<00:02:02.899> machine<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.350> go<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.770> time<00:02:04.040> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
the time machine to go to that time and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.370 
the time machine to go to that time and
so<00:02:04.430> cell<00:02:04.759> only<00:02:05.030> had<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.479> press<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.780> button<00:02:05.990> to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
so cell only had to press the button to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.289 
so cell only had to press the button to
activate<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:07.130> piccolo<00:02:07.579> then<00:02:07.759> theorized<00:02:08.269> that

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
activate it piccolo then theorized that

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.179 
activate it piccolo then theorized that
trunks<00:02:08.810> was<00:02:08.959> playing<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.349> come<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.769> in<00:02:09.979> time

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:10.189 
trunks was playing to come back in time

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.739 
trunks was playing to come back in time
to<00:02:10.340> tell<00:02:10.519> them<00:02:10.729> how<00:02:10.909> he<00:02:10.969> destroyed<00:02:11.569> the

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749 
to tell them how he destroyed the

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.839 
to tell them how he destroyed the
androids<00:02:12.439> however<00:02:12.829> none<00:02:13.159> of<00:02:13.189> this<00:02:13.370> actually

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
androids however none of this actually

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.400 
androids however none of this actually
makes

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
makes

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 
makes
considering<00:02:15.130> what<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:15.790> said<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.480> Sal

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
considering what was just said as Sal

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.380 
considering what was just said as Sal
had<00:02:17.050> said<00:02:17.320> he<00:02:17.560> came<00:02:17.770> back<00:02:18.040> four<00:02:18.460> years<00:02:18.490> before

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
had said he came back four years before

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.630 
had said he came back four years before
the<00:02:19.570> androids<00:02:20.140> appeared<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:21.070> trunk<00:02:21.430> set

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the androids appeared and as trunk set

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.340 
the androids appeared and as trunk set
when<00:02:21.760> he<00:02:21.850> found<00:02:22.120> cells<00:02:22.450> time<00:02:22.780> machine<00:02:23.170> this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
when he found cells time machine this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.440 
when he found cells time machine this
was<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.800> year<00:02:24.100> before<00:02:24.280> he<00:02:24.700> originally<00:02:25.240> came

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
was one year before he originally came

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.390 
was one year before he originally came
back<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> problem<00:02:26.800> here<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.190> if

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
back so the problem here is that if

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400 
back so the problem here is that if
trunks<00:02:27.760> went<00:02:27.970> back<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.570> years<00:02:28.870> before<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
trunks went back for years before the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.650 
trunks went back for years before the
androids<00:02:29.920> came<00:02:30.250> he'd<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.940> back<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.450> time

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
androids came he'd be going back in time

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.170 
androids came he'd be going back in time
before<00:02:31.900> he<00:02:32.290> ever<00:02:32.470> even<00:02:32.890> met<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.460> Z<00:02:33.700> freighters

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
before he ever even met the Z freighters

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.970 
before he ever even met the Z freighters
and<00:02:34.480> Trunks<00:02:35.020> arrival<00:02:35.470> would<00:02:35.590> take<00:02:35.830> place

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and Trunks arrival would take place

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.830 
and Trunks arrival would take place
during<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.490> period<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.850> time<00:02:37.060> before<00:02:37.270> Goku

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
during the period of time before Goku

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.990 
during the period of time before Goku
even<00:02:38.200> arrived<00:02:38.500> from<00:02:38.800> yard<00:02:39.070> track<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.700> wouldn't

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
even arrived from yard track so wouldn't

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.550 
even arrived from yard track so wouldn't
make<00:02:40.090> any<00:02:40.270> sense<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.630> trunks<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.170> come<00:02:41.380> back

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
make any sense for trunks to come back

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440 
make any sense for trunks to come back
to<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:41.920> point<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:43.150> he<00:02:43.330> would

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
to this point in time because he would

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.570 
to this point in time because he would
have<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.840> wait<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.230> years<00:02:44.770> before<00:02:45.100> he<00:02:45.340> could

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
have to wait for years before he could

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460 
have to wait for years before he could
actually<00:02:45.760> talk<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.510> Z<00:02:46.690> fighters<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.260> tell

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
actually talk to the Z fighters to tell

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.560 
actually talk to the Z fighters to tell
them<00:02:47.620> about<00:02:47.770> how<00:02:48.100> he<00:02:48.160> defeated<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.000> androids

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
them about how he defeated the androids

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.780 
them about how he defeated the androids
if<00:02:50.080> trunks<00:02:50.500> actually<00:02:50.890> did<00:02:51.100> talk<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> Z

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
if trunks actually did talk to the Z

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.310 
if trunks actually did talk to the Z
fighters<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.510> point<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.930> would<00:02:53.050> change

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
fighters at this point it would change

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.140 
fighters at this point it would change
history<00:02:53.620> create<00:02:54.280> an<00:02:54.490> entirely<00:02:54.910> different

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
history create an entirely different

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.030 
history create an entirely different
timeline<00:02:56.110> from<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.380> one<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.800> he<00:02:56.920> had

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
timeline from the one that he had

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.070 
timeline from the one that he had
already<00:02:57.220> visited<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.120> as<00:02:58.330> cell<00:02:58.600> did<00:02:58.870> when<00:02:59.050> he

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
already visited just as cell did when he

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.230 
already visited just as cell did when he
came<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.890> going<00:03:00.100> by<00:03:00.280> everything<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.850> just<00:03:00.880> said

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
came so going by everything I just said

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.150 
came so going by everything I just said
it<00:03:01.510> makes<00:03:01.690> no<00:03:01.930> sense<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.470> trunks<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.010> have

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
it makes no sense for trunks to have

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.250 
it makes no sense for trunks to have
ever<00:03:03.370> come<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:03.940> point<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:04.510> time<00:03:04.750> because

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
ever come to that point in time because

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.080 
ever come to that point in time because
it<00:03:05.320> would<00:03:05.410> completely<00:03:05.710> undermine<00:03:06.340> his<00:03:06.700> entire

it would completely undermine his entire

Toriyama<00:03:20.500> making<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.070> kind<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.370> mistake

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
Toriyama making this kind of mistake

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.880 
Toriyama making this kind of mistake
it's<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.090> exactly<00:03:22.620> unprecedented<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:23.860> I

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
it's not exactly unprecedented but I

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's not exactly unprecedented but I
think<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.280> have<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.490> possible<00:03:25.060> theory<00:03:25.330> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
think I have a possible theory to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.480 
think I have a possible theory to
explain<00:03:25.720> why<00:03:26.200> Toriyama<00:03:26.770> made<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.250> mistake

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
explain why Toriyama made this mistake

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.790 
explain why Toriyama made this mistake
to<00:03:27.940> begin<00:03:28.270> with<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:28.600> Sal<00:03:29.170> explained<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
to begin with as Sal explained in the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.680 
to begin with as Sal explained in the
same<00:03:30.010> conversation<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:31.030> takes<00:03:31.240> him<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.480> long

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
same conversation it takes him a long

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.080 
same conversation it takes him a long
time<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:32.230> regain<00:03:32.590> his<00:03:32.830> imperfect<00:03:33.370> form<00:03:33.880> after

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
time to regain his imperfect form after

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.540 
time to regain his imperfect form after
regressing<00:03:34.840> into<00:03:34.990> his<00:03:35.290> larval<00:03:35.800> state<00:03:36.130> and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
regressing into his larval state and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.220 
regressing into his larval state and
after<00:03:36.670> burying<00:03:37.090> himself<00:03:37.270> underground<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
after burying himself underground it

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.960 
after burying himself underground it
likely<00:03:38.590> took<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.980> whole<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.459> four<00:03:39.700> years

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
likely took the whole of the four years

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.730 
likely took the whole of the four years
for<00:03:40.209> him<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.390> actually<00:03:40.900> return<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.590> his

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
for him to actually return to his

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.800 
for him to actually return to his
imperfect<00:03:42.190> state<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.880> fact<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.450> manga

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
imperfect state in fact the manga

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.420 
imperfect state in fact the manga
confirms<00:03:44.290> us<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:44.830> when<00:03:45.010> Gohan<00:03:45.400> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
confirms us because when Gohan and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.490 
confirms us because when Gohan and
trucks<00:03:45.820> actually<00:03:46.360> find<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> remaining<00:03:47.110> shed

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
trucks actually find the remaining shed

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.040 
trucks actually find the remaining shed
skin<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.310> larval<00:03:48.730> form<00:03:49.090> trunks<00:03:49.630> puts<00:03:49.900> his

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
skin of the larval form trunks puts his

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.229 
skin of the larval form trunks puts his
hand<00:03:50.320> inside<00:03:50.620> fried<00:03:51.010> sides<00:03:51.310> still<00:03:51.640> wet<00:03:52.030> so

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
hand inside fried sides still wet so

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.210 
hand inside fried sides still wet so
it's<00:03:52.450> very<00:03:52.630> likely<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.260> he<00:03:53.440> had<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:53.860> shed

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it's very likely that he had just shed

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.370 
it's very likely that he had just shed
that<00:03:54.400> skin<00:03:54.459> before<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.450> went<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> ginger<00:03:56.170> town

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
that skin before he went to ginger town

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.080 
that skin before he went to ginger town
to<00:03:56.530> met<00:03:56.739> piccolo<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.580> what<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.730> think<00:03:57.820> is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
to met piccolo so what I think is

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.150 
to met piccolo so what I think is
possible<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.810> when<00:03:59.080> Akira<00:03:59.380> Toriyama<00:03:59.770> was

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
possible is that when Akira Toriyama was

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.979 
possible is that when Akira Toriyama was
originally<00:04:00.610> writing<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> manga<00:04:01.480> got<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.900> this

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
originally writing the manga got to this

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.960 
originally writing the manga got to this
part<00:04:02.320> in<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> storyline<00:04:03.040> he<00:04:03.640> had<00:04:03.730> written

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
part in the storyline he had written

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.880 
part in the storyline he had written
that<00:04:04.150> trunks<00:04:04.510> was<00:04:04.660> returning<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.320> unseen

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
that trunks was returning to the unseen

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.740 
that trunks was returning to the unseen
timeline<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.640> he<00:04:06.790> had<00:04:06.880> already<00:04:07.090> saved<00:04:07.510> in

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
timeline that he had already saved in

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.300 
timeline that he had already saved in
order<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.230> tell<00:04:08.440> them<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.800> he<00:04:08.980> had<00:04:09.100> killed

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
order to tell them that he had killed

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.580 
order to tell them that he had killed
the<00:04:09.430> androids<00:04:10.090> in<00:04:10.209> his<00:04:10.420> time<00:04:10.690> however<00:04:11.080> at<00:04:11.470> this

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
the androids in his time however at this

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.530 
the androids in his time however at this
point<00:04:11.650> it's<00:04:12.070> possible<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.730> Toriyama<00:04:13.239> came

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
point it's possible that Toriyama came

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.690 
point it's possible that Toriyama came
up<00:04:13.720> with<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.989> idea<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.410> cell<00:04:14.739> regressing<00:04:15.400> into

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
up with the idea of cell regressing into

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.940 
up with the idea of cell regressing into
his<00:04:15.850> larval<00:04:16.390> state<00:04:16.720> because<00:04:17.169> he<00:04:17.200> couldn't<00:04:17.650> fit

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
his larval state because he couldn't fit

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.590 
his larval state because he couldn't fit
into<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:18.640> machine<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.450> would

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
into the time machine and this would

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.599 
into the time machine and this would
also<00:04:19.780> help<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.230> serve<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.650> an<00:04:20.799> explanation<00:04:21.130> for

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
also help to serve as an explanation for

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.310 
also help to serve as an explanation for
why<00:04:21.790> so<00:04:22.060> many<00:04:22.210> things<00:04:22.510> were<00:04:22.690> different<00:04:22.930> in<00:04:23.229> the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
why so many things were different in the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.770 
why so many things were different in the
main<00:04:23.500> timeline<00:04:23.830> as<00:04:24.280> opposed<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.820> trunks<00:04:25.330> and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
main timeline as opposed to trunks and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.360 
main timeline as opposed to trunks and
on<00:04:25.960> top<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.380> this<00:04:26.470> would<00:04:26.650> also<00:04:26.890> give

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
on top of this would also give

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.920 
on top of this would also give
taught<00:04:27.490> me<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.669> bigger<00:04:27.940> reason<00:04:28.479> to<00:04:28.630> want<00:04:28.810> to

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
taught me a bigger reason to want to

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.930 
taught me a bigger reason to want to
fuse<00:04:29.199> with<00:04:29.229> piccolo<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.280> possible<00:04:30.760> that

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
fuse with piccolo so it's possible that

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.730 
fuse with piccolo so it's possible that
by<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> time<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.570> Akira<00:04:31.990> Toriyama<00:04:32.380> had

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
by the time that Akira Toriyama had

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.439 
by the time that Akira Toriyama had
written<00:04:32.949> this<00:04:33.190> down<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.699> manga<00:04:34.120> he<00:04:34.360> had

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
written this down in the manga he had

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.330 
written this down in the manga he had
completely<00:04:34.840> forgotten<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.590> cell<00:04:35.919> needed

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
completely forgotten that a cell needed

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.010 
completely forgotten that a cell needed
years<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:36.820> transform<00:04:37.389> back<00:04:37.570> into<00:04:37.900> his

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
years to transform back into his

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.870 
years to transform back into his
imperfect<00:04:38.590> form<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.160> wouldn't<00:04:39.520> make<00:04:39.669> sense

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
imperfect form this wouldn't make sense

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.460
