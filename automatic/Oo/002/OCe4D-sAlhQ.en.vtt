right<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.450> normal<00:01:51.750> length

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
right now this is not the normal length

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
right now this is not the normal length
of<00:01:52.200> her<00:01:52.290> hair<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.130> quite<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:53.880> longer

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of her hair it is quite a bit longer

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.899 
of her hair it is quite a bit longer
than<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.040> it's<00:01:56.040> still<00:01:56.280> long<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.640> her<00:01:56.729> head

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
than that it's still long on her head

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.400 
than that it's still long on her head
though<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.360> makes<00:01:57.600> her<00:01:57.750> look<00:01:57.869> pretty<00:01:57.929> silly

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
though which makes her look pretty silly

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.700 
though which makes her look pretty silly
but<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.220> think<00:01:59.340> she<00:01:59.550> knows<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.440> all<00:02:01.440> right

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
