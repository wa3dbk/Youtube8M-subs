00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
then they're managing to mitigate the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
then they're managing to mitigate the
situation<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.960> prevent<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.159> total<00:01:47.790> meltdown

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
situation and prevent a total meltdown

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.139 
situation and prevent a total meltdown
of<00:01:48.240> our<00:01:48.600> financial<00:01:49.140> system<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:51.000> know

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
of our financial system and I don't know

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
of our financial system and I don't know
if<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:53.450> if<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.780> continue<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> do

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
if they can if they can continue to do

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
if they can if they can continue to do
so<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.829> who<00:01:55.979> knows<00:01:56.130> let's<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:57.119> let's<00:01:57.479> just

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
so but who knows let's see let's just

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.580 
so but who knows let's see let's just
watch<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.189> if<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> system<00:02:00.659> implodes

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
watch and see if if the system implodes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.830 
watch and see if if the system implodes
because<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> low

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
because of low

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.010 
because of low
or<00:02:02.960> or<00:02:03.619> if<00:02:04.070> they<00:02:04.479> manage<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.509> pull<00:02:05.750> another

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
or or if they manage to pull another

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.870 
or or if they manage to pull another
rabbit<00:02:06.289> out<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.619> their<00:02:06.799> hat<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.280> think<00:02:07.789> they

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
rabbit out of their hat I think they

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.460 
rabbit out of their hat I think they
will<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.239> think<00:02:08.599> they'll<00:02:08.750> pull<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> rabbit<00:02:09.229> out

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
will I think they'll pull a rabbit out

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.089 
will I think they'll pull a rabbit out
of<00:02:09.500> their<00:02:09.679> hat<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.510> just<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:12.709> just<00:02:12.890> got<00:02:13.010> to

and the next one the next one see if

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.800 
and the next one the next one see if
they<00:02:18.170> could<00:02:18.230> they<00:02:18.739> could<00:02:18.769> continue<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
they could they could continue to to
