00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
as the diamond shape at the top will now

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.620 
as the diamond shape at the top will now
assemble<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:36.250> diamond<00:00:36.670> shape<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.150> make<00:00:37.510> it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
assemble the diamond shape and make it

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.340 
assemble the diamond shape and make it
into<00:00:37.810> a<00:00:37.930> pyramid<00:00:38.560> with<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.540> little<00:00:40.720> diamond<00:00:41.200> at

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
into a pyramid with a little diamond at

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.120 
into a pyramid with a little diamond at
the<00:00:41.380> top<00:00:41.770> so<00:00:42.640> we<00:00:42.670> get<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.000> line<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.550> one<00:00:45.880> and

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
the top so we get that line this one and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.300 
the top so we get that line this one and
this<00:00:48.130> line<00:00:48.460> press<00:00:49.300> them<00:00:49.510> all<00:00:49.690> together<00:00:50.310> and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
this line press them all together and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.420 
this line press them all together and
gather<00:00:51.670> them<00:00:52.000> from<00:00:52.030> underneath<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.190> you

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
gather them from underneath so that you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.140 
gather them from underneath so that you
end<00:00:54.610> up<00:00:54.820> with<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:56.070> square<00:00:57.070> or<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.340> diamond<00:00:57.970> at<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
end up with a square or a diamond at the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.280 
end up with a square or a diamond at the
top<00:00:58.800> using<00:00:59.800> my<00:00:59.950> hand<00:01:00.310> here<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:01.000> slight<00:01:01.930> twist

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
top using my hand here a slight twist

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.880 
top using my hand here a slight twist
and<00:01:02.530> D<00:01:02.890> clockwise<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:04.390> allows<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
and D clockwise and that allows the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.370 
and D clockwise and that allows the
second<00:01:06.400> line<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.729> come<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.200> can

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
second line to come in so that you can

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.760 
second line to come in so that you can
now<00:01:08.560> have<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.150> twist<00:01:10.150> in<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.540> pattern<00:01:11.079> when<00:01:11.650> you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
now have a twist in the pattern when you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.220 
now have a twist in the pattern when you
flatten<00:01:12.040> it<00:01:12.310> out<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:13.300> should<00:01:13.510> be<00:01:13.690> able<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.990> see

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
flatten it out you should be able to see

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.330 
flatten it out you should be able to see
our<00:01:14.800> angles<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.840> way<00:01:16.990> around<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.560> that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
our angles all the way around of that

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.800 
our angles all the way around of that
twist<00:01:20.010> from<00:01:21.010> here<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:22.180> want<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.630> have<00:01:22.780> a

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
twist from here we want to have a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.560 
twist from here we want to have a
mountain<00:01:23.140> fall<00:01:23.620> on<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.130> line<00:01:24.450> making<00:01:25.450> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
mountain fall on that line making a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.840 
mountain fall on that line making a
valley<00:01:25.840> fall<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.440> side<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.310> what<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:27.670> do<00:01:27.790> is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
valley fall on the side so what we do is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.080 
valley fall on the side so what we do is
push<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.890> make<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.520> mountain<00:01:30.790> fold

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
push this in and make a mountain fold

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.880 
push this in and make a mountain fold
here<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.890> brings<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.340> up<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:35.710> that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
here and that brings it up and do that

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
here and that brings it up and do that
again<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.850> see<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.390> takes<00:01:37.659> on<00:01:37.840> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
again and you can see it takes on a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
again and you can see it takes on a
three-dimensional<00:01:38.890> shape<00:01:39.159> once<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.120> do<00:01:40.299> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.180 

and<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:45.549> more<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:47.170> creates<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.680> spiral

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
and one more and that creates a spiral

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and one more and that creates a spiral
effect<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.870> can<00:01:50.049> enhance<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.830> by<00:01:51.210> just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
effect and you can enhance it by just

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.230 
effect and you can enhance it by just
making<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.900> slight<00:01:53.229> curve<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.549> paper<00:01:54.850> here

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
making a slight curve in the paper here

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
making a slight curve in the paper here
we<00:01:56.140> not<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:58.060> spiral<00:01:58.630> touch<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.740> rose

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
we not have the spiral touch of the rose

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.780 
we not have the spiral touch of the rose
turning<00:02:01.299> it<00:02:01.390> over<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.960> other<00:02:02.080> side

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
turning it over to the other side

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840 
turning it over to the other side
we'll<00:02:04.720> bring<00:02:04.930> this<00:02:05.110> up<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.530> across<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.280> right

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
we'll bring this up and across and right

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.590 
we'll bring this up and across and right
over<00:02:07.030> there<00:02:07.180> let<00:02:08.140> us<00:02:08.290> see<00:02:08.470> them<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.830> side

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
over there let us see them on the side

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.000 
over there let us see them on the side
and<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> next<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.760> next<00:02:12.790> one<00:02:13.120> and

and in the next one and the next one and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.040 
and in the next one and the next one and
collect<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> together<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.450> make<00:02:16.660> whole

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
collect that together to make whole

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.860 
collect that together to make whole
series<00:02:17.530> or<00:02:17.710> spirals<00:02:18.250> around<00:02:18.430> there<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.570> shape

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.920 
putting an index finger in there and
shaking<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.440> petal<00:02:47.860> all<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.250> way<00:02:48.370> around<00:02:48.930> go

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
shaking the petal all the way around go

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.310 
shaking the petal all the way around go
around<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.290> few<00:02:50.440> times<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.930> would<00:02:53.110> give

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
around a few times and that would give

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.660 
around a few times and that would give
you<00:02:53.530> need<00:02:54.459> petals<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:56.110> now<00:02:56.260> concentrate<00:02:57.100> on

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you need petals we now concentrate on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.990 
you need petals we now concentrate on
making<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.780> arrow<00:02:58.989> points<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.550> from

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
making the arrow points that is from

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.860 
making the arrow points that is from
here<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:02.080> open<00:03:02.440> up<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.709> these<00:03:02.920> paddles<00:03:03.870> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
here we open up one of these paddles you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.140 
here we open up one of these paddles you
can<00:03:05.050> see<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.709> one<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.459> balls<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:06.970> did

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
can see that one of the balls we did

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.690 
can see that one of the balls we did
before<00:03:07.330> was<00:03:08.140> an<00:03:08.320> arrow<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.550> how<00:03:09.670> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
before was an arrow and this is how you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.960 
before was an arrow and this is how you
get<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> put<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.860> together<00:03:12.070> you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
get that as you put that together you

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.320 
get that as you put that together you
have<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.300> reverse<00:03:13.720> for<00:03:14.019> this<00:03:14.410> part<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.330> so

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
have to reverse for this part of it so

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.780 
have to reverse for this part of it so
one<00:03:16.540> reverse<00:03:16.870> folder<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.190> allows<00:03:18.519> one

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
one reverse folder and that allows one

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.720 
one reverse folder and that allows one
petal<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.299> grow<00:03:19.480> through
