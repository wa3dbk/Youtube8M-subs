00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.060
 I would do with schools first of all 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.469
 right to study today but also in 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.820
 italy a national law on the law 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.910
 at the studio 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.130
 must ensure that 17 54 of the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.599
 students that today we say interrupt i 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.920
 their studies to go to work because 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.080
 you can't afford to go to 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.670
 school must receive state subsidies 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.410
 to continue their progress in 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.300
 training the school for us must be 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.130
 like the imaginary berlinguer 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.810
 there is a school that serves as an elevator 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.070
 social we give ourselves also in the streets to 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.960
 say that private individuals must not enter 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.539
 within the public school that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.760
 serves a public and public school 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.589
 quality and neumann and private or in the hands of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.269
 who today, however, to dismantle everything 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.249
 the Italian public system are 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.819
 then a caste is drawn at 10 percent 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:48.519
 of natural innovative innovators with 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.039
 position allowance and then in 66 per 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.679
 one hundred of deserving for each school is a 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.719
 34 percent that is worth nothing 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.059
 but it seems normal to me if I'm not in school 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.519
 all good and then who decides who he is 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.979
 good and who is not good is not dividend 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.299
 the teachers that you solve the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.909
 problem is also from a point of view 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.590
 not only merit theocratic but also some 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.600
 of economic recognition 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.210
 us with the steps we had that there 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.299
 they removed a lot more than 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.439
 these 60 euros after three years 150 thousand 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.289
 which must take 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.320
 meanwhile there is a European directive that if 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.090
 do not hire these 150 thousand temporary workers who 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.170
 they are those of the first band all of them 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.289
 because then there is a second and a third 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.179
 band that will remain on foot if not there 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.549
 hiring by November 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.009
 Italy will have a fine of almost 4,000 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.870
 billions because they are teachers who give 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.140
 more years 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.360
 are hired and fired every year e 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.260
 after three years this cannot be done 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.210
 is telling you the europe government is 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.310
 making the game of the three cards cut 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.080
 to the university to research and law 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.400
 in the study to finance the opening 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.770
 schools also in the afternoon 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.810
 the opening of schools to those, however, to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.420
 private companies to transform 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.860
 even the school a company school like 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.940
 was done with the university by 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 gelmini reform 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.500
 today we say no to all this 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.510
 let's say no to new cuts at university 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.910
 to research and at the same time we say 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.810
 no to private individuals in high schools 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 we want a training model 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.090
 different is radically different we must 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.410
 say that concern the reform of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.350
 shit because he loves reform 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.890
 old because it follows the reforms of the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.320
 min 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.260
 we must say that the construction of 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.570
 new bureaucracies are not functional to 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.220
 interests of students and it is not 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.150
 functional to the interests of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.120
 teachers 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.250
 we have to say which the fuck of 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.320
 private enter school if these are not 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.120
 they have a lira 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.000
 ghd hair to invest in schools 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 we want 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.270
 nice and we want to know what they want 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.870
 you can never fill the void with 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.470
 other man who put the money in 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 school 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.360
 the future the good school just tells us 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400
 that private individuals must enter the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.980
 school councils that the school must 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.940
 be encouraged by companies 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.100
 external 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.500
 according to us the concept of school is 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.600
 different we want another school there 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.540
 school we want is that of 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.760
 the right to study is that of a plan 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.800
 for school building and that of the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.470
 free textbooks for all 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.620
 students is that of the facilities on 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.620
 transport 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.159
 welcome nothing the gold mandates help
