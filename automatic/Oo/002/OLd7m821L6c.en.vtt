nice<00:03:06.180> bobblehead<00:03:06.840> piece<00:03:07.400> really<00:03:08.400> nice<00:03:08.550> paint

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
nice bobblehead piece really nice paint

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
nice bobblehead piece really nice paint
as<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:09.290> let's<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.500> look<00:03:10.530> at<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> side<00:03:12.440> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
as well let's have a look at the side it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.720 
as well let's have a look at the side it
actually<00:03:13.470> doesn't<00:03:13.860> say<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> number<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.610> it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
actually doesn't say a number but it

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.400 
actually doesn't say a number but it
says<00:03:14.850> half<00:03:15.030> chance<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.540> each<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.080> can<00:03:16.110> collect

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
says half chance of each you can collect

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.320 
says half chance of each you can collect
them<00:03:16.620> all<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.010> guess<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.820> an<00:03:17.970> equal

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
them all so I guess you have an equal

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.160 
them all so I guess you have an equal
chance<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:18.989> getting<00:03:19.230> any<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.769> them

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
chance of really getting any of them

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.900 
chance of really getting any of them
star-lord

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
star-lord

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.190 
star-lord
fitting<00:03:23.910> enough<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.269> guess<00:03:24.420> being<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.019> leader

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
fitting enough I guess being the leader

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.979 
fitting enough I guess being the leader
of<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> gardens<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.010> galaxy<00:03:26.459> let's<00:03:27.390> find<00:03:27.750> out
