00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.440
 with the same clothes as in other videos 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.879
 previous but good at the end the time 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 what do you have I imagine that everyone 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.090
 We will do and take advantage of recording several 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 videos followed and well this is about 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.310
 all because I already told you by instagram 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 and by facebook how good we had 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 enlarged the family 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.520
 we had enlarged the family and now 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.039
 we are one more and good we have a small 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 more inhabitant in our house is a 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.829
 Lovely super nice kitten is now 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 sleeping and what I told you I had 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.899
 that record well because it's very good 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 kid is in the end a puppy that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.960
 all he wants is to play and play 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.789
 play and it does not leave you neither in the sun nor in the shade 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.519
 you are cooking and you have 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.730
 side are you doing anything you're going 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.679
 to the bathroom and it comes from behind is like your 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 shadow and I tell you the same now I put 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.230
 to make up whatever and I have 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 back and now it's 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.680
 more or less of the nap already in the afternoon 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.360
 and that can throw sleeping like a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.240
 lots of time so I say I'm going to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.530
 take advantage of the one locked there in the living room 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.570
 and well now I'm just going to teach you to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.409
 see if I wake him up and let him record 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.799
 but more of an illusion to show you what 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:34.409
 and nothing else I'm going to try to find the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.880
 kitty and I show you now I want 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.600
 because I think you really like the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.209
 videos of the kittens and because of some 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.390
 good way now I explain you I want 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.390
 create a channel in fact and as you see 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.450
 I think create a channel for my kitty and 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.700
 well my brother and sister in law have 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 two other kittens and well then a little 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.670
 of the antics that do not explain 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.820
 Little things of cats because there are many people 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 I was even before I had the cat 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.259
 asking my sister does today to me 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.810
 my sister to my brother to my sister in law and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.540
 other things about the cat because I did not have 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 idea then likewise explain 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.890
 certain little things of cats so that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.950
 those who do not know them 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.500
 know more because I think there's a lot of myth 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.720
 with respect to cats I think that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.290
 we have a pretty wrong concept 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.140
 of cats have nothing to do with 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 what we hear then what is and good 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 Well, what I wanted and especially 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.620

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.560
 certain certain moments serving you 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.739
 grow and have it remember and good 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.100
 Well, if those pranks make you laugh or 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.900
 can help even people who 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.630

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.040
