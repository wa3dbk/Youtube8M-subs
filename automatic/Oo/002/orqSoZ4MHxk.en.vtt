00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
loose and wiggly here I mean this is

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.800 
loose and wiggly here I mean this is
obviously<00:05:50.280> not<00:05:50.430> going<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.669> work<00:05:50.820> but<00:05:51.180> what<00:05:51.660> you

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
obviously not going to work but what you

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.170 
obviously not going to work but what you
do<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.229> take<00:05:52.440> this<00:05:52.650> ring<00:05:53.010> round<00:05:54.000> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
do is you take this ring round the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.710 
do is you take this ring round the
outside<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.990> you<00:05:55.490> tighten<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:56.610> up<00:05:56.910> like<00:05:57.450> that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
outside and you tighten it up like that

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.140 
outside and you tighten it up like that
once<00:05:57.960> you've<00:05:58.139> got<00:05:58.289> in<00:05:58.380> position<00:05:58.820> these<00:05:59.820> things

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
once you've got in position these things

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.180 
once you've got in position these things
don't<00:06:00.300> tighten<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.930> way<00:06:01.260> they're<00:06:01.979> actually

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
don't tighten that way they're actually

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.890 
don't tighten that way they're actually
that<00:06:02.639> that's<00:06:02.850> not<00:06:03.090> how<00:06:03.270> they<00:06:03.450> tighten<00:06:03.810> them

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
that that's not how they tighten them

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.700 
that that's not how they tighten them
they<00:06:04.830> tighten<00:06:05.280> by<00:06:05.460> turning<00:06:06.030> this<00:06:06.660> way<00:06:06.930> like

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
they tighten by turning this way like

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.730 
they tighten by turning this way like
this<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.760> then<00:06:09.210> once<00:06:10.169> you've<00:06:10.380> got<00:06:10.410> it<00:06:10.560> in

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
this and that then once you've got it in

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.629 
this and that then once you've got it in
a<00:06:10.800> right<00:06:10.979> position<00:06:11.160> it<00:06:11.520> will<00:06:11.639> lock<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.360> lens

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
a right position it will lock the lens

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.460 
a right position it will lock the lens
for<00:06:14.639> your<00:06:14.729> shot<00:06:14.940> it's<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.539> little<00:06:16.110> bit<00:06:16.260> of<00:06:16.380> a

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
for your shot it's a little bit of a

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.950 
for your shot it's a little bit of a
