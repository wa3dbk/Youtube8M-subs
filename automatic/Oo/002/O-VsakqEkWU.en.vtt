00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and today is an online ticket store and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.819
 today we will tell you about whey 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.109
 protein from the Ukrainian manufacturer 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.410
 power pro 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.920
 means represented on the video with us 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.450
 strength 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.990
 protein called protein power mix 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.000
 wei protein 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 tasteful chocolate with cinnamon 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 mean on the sports nutrition market 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.269
 Ukraine is probably one of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.330
 only one such solid 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 sports nutrition manufacturer 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 submitted to the composition 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.520
 does this whey protein 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 characterized by the fact that he has a high 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.320
 protein content per 100 grams 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.600
 they make us in such a proportion 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 then look here 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.329
 whey proteins and that is whey 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.600
 protein isolate and hydrolyzate is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.969
 65 grams per 100 grams 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.100
 collagen hydrolyzate 20 grams and so 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.899
 we also have coordinates that is casein 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 protein you say so 5 grams per 100 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.149
 gram with the total number is 90 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.799
 grams of protein per 100 grams is very large 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.780
 the ratio means then we still have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 amino acids bailiff amino acids 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 we are represented here on this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.350
 nameplate means everything is present 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.200
 basic amino acids isoleucine leucine and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 other here is such an impressive list 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 I kind of say you even with such 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.500
 Likely protein even amino acids 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.680
 you should not take it separately because 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.119
 their whole big concentration 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 proteins let's say so find ukrainian 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.640
 producer means carbohydrate 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.070
 and later equal as pro you say let's say 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 such a nice small amount 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.900
 carbohydrate content per serving and fat 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.150
 also the minimum number of servings api 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.490
 this is 40 grams of it here 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.550
 Here is the specified 40 grams per serving 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.070
 accounting for 31 grams of protein means 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.869
 good value can even 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 recommend this protein is not about 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.979
 length not to people not only who came 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.619
 gym and is engaged from recently and those 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.509
 who have long been in sports mean where 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.410
 I think they do not appreciate this one 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.180
 Here is the Ukrainian Ukrainian product 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.180
 so I want to add so beautiful 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.570
 bright colorful packaging we have 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.390
 represented by an image of an athlete means 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.470
 there is a manufacturerâ€™s website indicated 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 what else can I add 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.920
 Well, recommendations for use in principle 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.769
 you can take it one day to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360
 four servings of such a protein or 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.040
 it is advisable not to take it on 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.440
 night because it does contain 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.350
 carbohydrates, albeit small quantities, they 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.579
 as you know at a later time of day not 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.260
 especially helpful means recommendations 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.850
 at the same time we recommended one serving 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.090
 who only want to try 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.739
 sports nutrition 2 3 4 portion this 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.110
 people who already know why 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.360
 protein is required in this case 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.340
 whey protein can take 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.420
 how to workout west for an hour for 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.900
 one and a half right after training 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.410
 in order to fill the lack of proteins in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.000
 your body means the rest of the tricks 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.320
 can share during the day in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.360
 depending on your needs 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.860
 recommend taking between meals 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.610
 food a portion of 40 grams in principle can 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.250
 increase slightly to 60 grams but 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.350
 at the same time, you risk increasing 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 corresponding amount of proteins per 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.900
 30 gram portions how do you know that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.730
 the most optimal number that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.700
 absorbed by the human body for 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.269
 one meal all this figure 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.640
 different but principle yes i read in 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.930
 online that up to 40 to 50 grams principle 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.390
 human body can infection 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.000
 learn normally look by themselves 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.310
 how will you get this protein digested 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.260
 your body 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 so what's the stir recommend 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.019
 stir exclusively with water 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.480
 skim milk is better to drink it and in 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.370
 the usual way why because not infrequent 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.319
 cases of someone to him who are not 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.389
 lactose tolerant may occur 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.669
 digestive problems therefore 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.079
 stirred with some water 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.269
 will be well absorbed by your body 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.239
 the amount of water you can take 500 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.859
 milliliters can 600 look to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.959
 only the concentration was so 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.870
 quite liquid was not so thick 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.090
 mixtures in general to whom this protein 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.099
 liked go to the online store 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 Glad acquirer on sports nutrition 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.580
 and please your body with valuable 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.580
 sports supplements thanks
