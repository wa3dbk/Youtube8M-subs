this<00:00:36.420> video<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.649> probably<00:00:37.980> well

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this video but it's probably well

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
this video but it's probably well
they're<00:00:38.700> easy<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.149> guess<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
they're easy to guess which is going to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
they're easy to guess which is going to
be<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.030> from

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
going to put it out there that suggests

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.970 
going to put it out there that suggests
to<00:00:57.690> me<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.440> alliance<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to me that that could be alliance and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.880 
to me that that could be alliance and
horde<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.910> judging<00:01:00.449> by<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> shoulders<00:01:01.500> alone

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
horde but judging by the shoulders alone

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
horde but judging by the shoulders alone
on<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.820> cloth<00:01:03.120> armor<00:01:03.420> set<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.500> very

on this cloth armor set it's very

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
on this cloth armor set it's very
reminiscent<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.330> plate<00:01:06.570> shoulders<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
reminiscent of some plate shoulders that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770
