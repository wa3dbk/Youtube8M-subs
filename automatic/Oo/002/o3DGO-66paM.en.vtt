00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.189
 wdr 2 volker pispers 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:10.589
 Now they do not and I will 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.919
 tuesday we will be awake twelve times 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.379
 heia then choice is Sunday or 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.360
 then we have the relief where on 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 day after the election usually the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.099
 first election presents again 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.910
 be collected in one more point 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.769
 the difference is different 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 Christmas clearly from the relief 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 on election night if you give away 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.580
 has this correct 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.900
 Inappropriate Christmas presents you can 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.210
 exchange easily 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 but if you have dialed the wrong number can 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 the earliest in four years again 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 Correct if your voice first in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.900
 she is buried by the urn 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.850
 Nobody heard any more, I think so 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.530
 time after an election particularly exciting 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.870
 because then usually unexpected 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.880
 discoveries were made there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.220
 even household holes discovered the front 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.530
 perhaps not at all suspected 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.880
 discover this time that the 14th 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.130
 Millions of people are with us as 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.280
 Aufstocker are actually on the way 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.859
 but unemployed, many say 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.329
 everything does not matter the main thing 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:12.539
 election campaign is finally over 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.329
 because in the main election campaign is a whole 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.189
 special form of torture someday 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.829
 one bears this mixture from a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.409
 Sneezing and meaningless 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.899
 Just do not talk anymore if you look at yourself 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.520
 can redeem with a cross why 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.689
 Not 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 By the way, if she still does not 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.899
 Know who you are after the election 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.340
 want to be fooled and her 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.319
 decisions then rather from 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 want to make other criteria dependent 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.539
 as from merkel's necklace or from 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.090
 steinbrÃ¼cks image there is on the internet 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.340
 the wahlomat because it is not about 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.249
 appearance or sympathy 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.170
 but only around topics there 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.240
 Become 38 themes after your 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.639
 interviewed and experienced afterwards 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.499
 you then which party most likely with 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.280
 what she agrees with 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.439
 hold 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.689
 many big eyes have already made 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.789
 if he is the question wahlomat honest 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.679
 answered and then finds out 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.289
 which party he actually choose 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.179
 I would have to find it anyway 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.400
 Democratic if you are in the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.880
 Wahlkabine will set up a wahlomat 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.890
 instead of on 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.110
 and luck behind a cardboard nose 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.660
 declare them in the cross 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.180
 polling booth in 38 ask what they really are 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
 content and want to conclude 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.350
 The Wahlomat congratulations you have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.300
 just following party elected 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.400
 that would be the outcome of elections 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.540
 actually make exciting 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.330
