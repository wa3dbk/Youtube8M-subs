pliers hold the briolette and wrap about
two<00:01:22.569> times

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.530 

you<00:01:29.960> can<00:01:30.140> trim<00:01:30.410> off<00:01:30.620> that<00:01:30.890> excess<00:01:31.460> wire<00:01:32.150> using

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
you can trim off that excess wire using

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.360 
you can trim off that excess wire using
your<00:01:32.660> flush<00:01:32.900> cutters<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:35.540> now<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.780> have<00:01:36.370> what

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
your flush cutters so now you have what

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.840 
your flush cutters so now you have what
looks<00:01:37.550> like<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:40.370> you're<00:01:40.490> going<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.700> take

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
looks like this and you're going to take

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.000 
looks like this and you're going to take
your<00:01:41.000> round<00:01:41.180> nose<00:01:41.300> pliers<00:01:41.770> you're<00:01:42.770> going<00:01:42.950> to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
your round nose pliers you're going to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:02:00.580 
your round nose pliers you're going to
create<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.280> wrapped<00:01:43.550> wire<00:01:43.880> loop

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.399 

you're<00:02:01.159> going<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.369> wrap<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.759> wire<00:02:01.790> around

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
you're going to wrap the wire around

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.639 
you're going to wrap the wire around
until<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.530> meets<00:02:03.740> up<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.750> other<00:02:08.649> wire

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
until it meets up with the other wire

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.610 
until it meets up with the other wire
wraps<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.310> trim<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.959> off<00:02:14.959> with

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
wraps then you can trim that off with

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.320 
wraps then you can trim that off with
your<00:02:15.860> flush<00:02:16.130> cutters<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:19.459> tighten<00:02:20.060> any<00:02:20.209> loose

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
your flush cutters you tighten any loose

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.670 
your flush cutters you tighten any loose
ends<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.400> chain<00:02:22.640> nose<00:02:22.670> pliers<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.809 

that's<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.459> simple<00:02:28.910> variation<00:02:30.519> now<00:02:31.519> some

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
that's the simple variation now some

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.590 
that's the simple variation now some
people<00:02:31.940> like<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.780> wrap<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.980> wire<00:02:34.160> around<00:02:34.819> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
people like to wrap the wire around and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.960 
people like to wrap the wire around and
around<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.930> around<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.610> covers<00:02:37.940> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
around and around so that it covers the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.550 
around and around so that it covers the
entire<00:02:38.120> top<00:02:38.630> part<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.110> briolette

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
entire top part of the briolette

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.000 
entire top part of the briolette
to<00:02:40.489> do<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.049> you'd<00:02:42.049> start<00:02:42.380> with<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.560> longer

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
to do that you'd start with a longer

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.960 
to do that you'd start with a longer
piece<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.340> wire<00:02:48.040> thread<00:02:49.040> your<00:02:49.220> briolette<00:02:49.610> on

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.979 

you're<00:02:52.970> going<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.180> do<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> same<00:02:53.599> thing<00:02:55.989> you

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
you're going to do the same thing you

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:08.010 
you're going to do the same thing you
Bend<00:02:57.230> both<00:02:58.690> parts<00:02:59.690> upward

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.930 

you<00:03:08.560> still<00:03:08.800> have<00:03:09.010> your<00:03:09.040> top<00:03:09.430> part<00:03:09.730> that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
you still have your top part that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.150 
you still have your top part that
becomes<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.450> loop<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:12.010> then<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.790> other<00:03:12.970> part

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
becomes the loop but then the other part

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.180 
becomes the loop but then the other part
instead<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.280> wrapping<00:03:15.580> upward<00:03:17.070> you're<00:03:18.070> going

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
instead of wrapping upward you're going

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.060 
instead of wrapping upward you're going
to<00:03:18.280> start<00:03:18.580> wrapping<00:03:20.070> downward<00:03:22.920> you're<00:03:23.920> going

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
to start wrapping downward you're going

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.990 
to start wrapping downward you're going
to<00:03:24.130> continue<00:03:24.520> wrapping<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.580> doesn't<00:03:27.880> have

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
to continue wrapping and it doesn't have

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.450 
to continue wrapping and it doesn't have
to<00:03:28.150> be<00:03:28.270> neat<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.650> kind<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.340> UH<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:33.280> a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
to be neat this is kind of a UH just a

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.630 
to be neat this is kind of a UH just a
natural<00:03:33.940> look<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:35.410> wrap<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.100> wrap<00:03:36.340> and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
natural look you just wrap and wrap and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.610 
natural look you just wrap and wrap and
wrap<00:03:37.860> till<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:39.010> get<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.960> where<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.230> hole<00:03:41.410> is

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
wrap till you get to where the hole is

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.540 
wrap till you get to where the hole is
in<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.860> briolette<00:03:46.860> then<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.010> start<00:03:48.250> working

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
in the briolette then you start working

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.370 
in the briolette then you start working
your<00:03:48.820> way<00:03:48.880> back<00:03:49.030> up<00:03:51.900> then<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.050> would<00:03:53.170> just

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
your way back up then you would just

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.550 
your way back up then you would just
complete<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.100> way<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.310> would<00:03:54.610> complete<00:03:55.270> a
