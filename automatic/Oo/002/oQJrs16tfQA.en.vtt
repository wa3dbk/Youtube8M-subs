into some of the darker colors right
here<00:00:22.030> and<00:00:22.300> let<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.020> bottom<00:00:23.380> part<00:00:23.650> of<00:00:23.740> my<00:00:23.800> brush

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
here and let the bottom part of my brush

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.350 
here and let the bottom part of my brush
reach<00:00:25.000> into<00:00:25.390> those<00:00:25.540> darker<00:00:25.990> colors<00:00:27.210> what's<00:00:28.210> on

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
reach into those darker colors what's on

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.940 
reach into those darker colors what's on
the<00:00:28.480> bottom<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:29.320> then<00:00:29.470> when<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:29.770> put<00:00:30.160> it<00:00:31.030> down

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
the bottom and then when I put it down

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.000 
the bottom and then when I put it down
it<00:00:32.950> casts<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:35.170> value<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.559> wanted<00:00:35.920> the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
it casts the the value I wanted the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.739 
it casts the the value I wanted the
darker<00:00:36.339> value<00:00:36.670> come<00:00:36.999> into<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.269> little<00:00:37.539> lighter

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
darker value come into a little lighter

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.709 
darker value come into a little lighter
value<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.559> just<00:00:39.100> touch<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.339> remember<00:00:40.269> I'm<00:00:40.570> not

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
value and just touch it remember I'm not

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.369 
value and just touch it remember I'm not
really<00:00:40.899> being<00:00:41.140> perfect<00:00:41.949> about<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:43.379> flowers

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
really being perfect about the flowers

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.119 
really being perfect about the flowers
I'm<00:00:44.620> just<00:00:44.829> getting<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.429> idea<00:00:45.789> up<00:00:45.940> there<00:00:47.069> so<00:00:48.069> I

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
I'm just getting the idea up there so I

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.799 
I'm just getting the idea up there so I
might<00:00:48.339> go<00:00:48.909> ahead<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:49.179> myself

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
might go ahead and myself

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.940 
might go ahead and myself
reach<00:00:50.559> in<00:00:50.890> come<00:00:51.609> back

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.990 

remembering<00:00:55.950> how<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.310> bookends<00:00:56.700> really<00:00:56.880> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
remembering how those bookends really is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670 
remembering how those bookends really is
sort<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:57.720> but<00:00:57.990> not<00:00:58.140> being<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.560> perfect

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.640 

now<00:01:03.130> I<00:01:03.160> take<00:01:03.460> them<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.670> little<00:01:03.790> further<00:01:04.650> change

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
now I take them a little further change

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.690 
now I take them a little further change
these<00:01:05.950> into<00:01:06.160> more

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
these into more

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.280 
these into more
and<00:01:07.060> they'll<00:01:07.210> put<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> greens<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
and they'll put the greens in in a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:20.330 
and they'll put the greens in in a
second<00:01:08.710> too

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 

nice<00:01:20.880> part<00:01:21.510> about<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.900> type<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> painting<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
nice part about this type of painting is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.680 
nice part about this type of painting is
most<00:01:23.490> people<00:01:23.760> when<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:23.940> watch<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.420> can

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
most people when they watch it they can

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.660 
most people when they watch it they can
go<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.860> better<00:01:25.979> than<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
go I can do better than that because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
go I can do better than that because
that's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> idea<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.799> want
