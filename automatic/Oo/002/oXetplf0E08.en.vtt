so<00:01:12.540> let's<00:01:12.780> show<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.729> torus<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> light<00:01:15.180> again

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.420 

of<00:01:25.160> course<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:25.610> hard<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.970> slow<00:01:26.180> down<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
of course it's hard to slow down the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.600 
of course it's hard to slow down the
accelerated<00:01:28.430> motion<00:01:30.190> but<00:01:31.190> there<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.790> see<00:01:31.820> it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
accelerated motion but there you see it

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.130 
accelerated motion but there you see it
you<00:01:34.610> see<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.030> elimination<00:01:35.720> along<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
you see the elimination along the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.310 
you see the elimination along the
decreasing<00:01:36.770> Taurus<00:01:37.160> or<00:01:37.340> doughnut<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.970> light

decreasing Taurus or doughnut of light

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.680 
decreasing Taurus or doughnut of light
and<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:42.290> as<00:01:42.440> close<00:01:42.680> as<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:43.130> get<00:01:43.690> without

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and it's as close as we can get without

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.020 
and it's as close as we can get without
actually<00:01:45.170> avoiding<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.010> glass<00:01:46.280> between<00:01:49.030> it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
actually avoiding the glass between it's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.000 
actually avoiding the glass between it's
also<00:01:50.150> very<00:01:50.570> hard<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.990> slow<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.350> show<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.830> in

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
also very hard to slow you show you in

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.730 
also very hard to slow you show you in
slow<00:01:52.190> motion<00:01:52.900> you<00:01:53.900> can<00:01:54.080> actually<00:01:54.229> see<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
slow motion you can actually see the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.219 
slow motion you can actually see the
Taurus<00:01:55.160> in<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.430> center<00:01:58.810> forming<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.080> then

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
Taurus in the center forming and then

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.230 
Taurus in the center forming and then
you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.500> see<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.890> Taurus<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.490> light<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:05.119> you

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can see the Taurus of light here you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.419 
you can see the Taurus of light here you
have<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:06.050> holographic<00:02:07.929> like<00:02:09.250> projection<00:02:10.250> a

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
have a holographic like projection a

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.000 
have a holographic like projection a
light<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:12.070> Taurus<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.310> light<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:15.010> shrinking

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
light a Taurus of light a shrinking

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.550 
light a Taurus of light a shrinking
Taurus<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.640> light<00:02:16.880> that's<00:02:17.870> formed<00:02:18.380> from

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
Taurus of light that's formed from

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.180 
Taurus of light that's formed from
dielectric<00:02:19.480> avoidance<00:02:20.980> between<00:02:21.980> two

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
dielectric avoidance between two

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.430 
dielectric avoidance between two
centripetal<00:02:22.640> magnetic<00:02:23.480> fields<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.050> voidance

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
centripetal magnetic fields and voidance

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.430 
centripetal magnetic fields and voidance
are<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.920> incorrectly<00:02:25.400> call<00:02:25.670> attraction

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
are what you incorrectly call attraction

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.039 
are what you incorrectly call attraction
so<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> Taurus<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.910> light<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:32.049> shrinking

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
so this is a Taurus of light a shrinking

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.100 
so this is a Taurus of light a shrinking
sphere<00:02:33.850> shrinking<00:02:34.850> Taurus<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.540> light<00:02:35.780> between

nobody's<00:02:48.820> seen<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.270> before<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.080> you're<00:02:50.380> the

nobody's seen this before so you're the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.900 
nobody's seen this before so you're the

make another quick video to show you
