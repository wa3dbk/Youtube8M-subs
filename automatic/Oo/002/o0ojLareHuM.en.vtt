00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.639
 a great opportunity 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.310
 and still the FC Carl Zeiss has space and 19 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.179
 the energies stele of a top team and so he will 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.709
 Dr Solo 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.709
 the scorer the fourth ass 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.819
 Circle class 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 for FC Carl Zeiss 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.890
 for the children is the Christmas Mass in Rome 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.120
 that's what they came up with 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.930
 RWE can the government hint that up 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.770
 in the direction 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 Dynamo Dresden the a3 we have decided then here is quiet 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.870
 be 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 so we could have been to these services 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 disciplined put the usual performance of Thuringia 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.890
 the Steelers a top team of this third league 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.290
 Bernd Wegener thought the ball came back from the post 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 then nothing to save 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 Boll "That's a clear one 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.040
 a clear language is very large 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.260
 Victory in series 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.050
 Gudrun's balance sheets have brought Dresen 28 points at night wins in a row and now 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.050
 FC Carl Zeiss comes and they have their teeth 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.210
 this great sad balance is in full swing 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.830
 Matthias main prohibited 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 according to his statements on the 16th and though 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.980
 against Kickers Offenbach 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 he got a lot out of this team 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.219
 which still governs opportunities there, it rises to the head 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.110
 Palionis because in such situations as mentioned with forums exchange however 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.720
 It's also not just the day of Tristesse getting the best pictures 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 not in the coffers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.630
 Duel against the contaminated sites all at the level of 1 0 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.759
 more Minden decision certainly danger 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.849
 then they learn that they are not under control 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.099
 produced over more 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.079
 the DAX is not in control again and sees the red card of 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.079
 Referee Kever 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.629
 the expansion 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 Warendorf 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.809
 Vettel never 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.809
 we are in such situations 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.119
 8 region for FC Carl Zeiss 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.769
 for the next game 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.749
 First of all the thank you from Fanny Megajoule at the cathedral who really is one 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.680
 has offered a great second half and leave some Dresdner fans 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.600
 disappointed 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 the football temple rudolf harbig stadium 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.549
 although she still the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.319
 team 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.049
 registered 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.539
 Background would have seen 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 now is a great opportunity 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.129
 the FC Carl Zeiss now outnumbered 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.929
 in the last minutes 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.139
 the second time 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.249
 called and they jubilate the fans of FC Carl Zeiss for them has become the 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.589
 Trip worth it then it's over 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.469
 a clear 3 to zero success for the ENA 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.989
 next to 66 a game of both teams so the 24 inch follows for the FC 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.769
 Carl Zeiss that the statistical data that the statistical values 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:51.229
 the animals they become impressive for the shame of the perpetrators 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.739
 and more importantly 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.129
 without the important three points in the promotion fight there we are now on the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.939
 Votes about the game Wilson Thorsten Trütgen more critical 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.260
 how do you look here for which come 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.170
 around the points 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.299
 at e10 and we succeeded 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.989
 Although I see it, it is also time to bless 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.909
 it's not that the scene 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.479
 if the winner of the tournament was this could want to present there 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.829
 she experienced the scene 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.269
 Künast 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.370
 I think I have to clear the ball when I said that I am this game she is 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.020
 Surely they know very little they see where the outsider is 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.300
 but this 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 in that sense it is because that is the case 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.729
 the eagles was definitely
