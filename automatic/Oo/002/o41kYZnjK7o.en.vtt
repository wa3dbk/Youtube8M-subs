 Gil woes also face to face disassemble 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 their confrontation in the smallest detail 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.599
 let's go for both teams coming 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.750
 the fight was a great chance to gain a foothold 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.820
 top five 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.100
 first fight in the first battle on ruinberg 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 teams disperse all over the map 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.660
 unity digging in the city and rhinos 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.390
 occupies a village in the east card and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 already 1 minute outlines the nature of the match 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 the game is called going 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.649
 long minutes the players are not a meter 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.899
 left occupied positions and first accurate 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.390
 the shot was fired in only 45 seconds 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.399
 until the end of the round rhinoceros throw 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 forces into the city and tear apart about parts 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 anatolic and copy 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 however, of strategic importance it is already 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530
 had no playing time ends 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 draw 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 second fight in the second battle in the mines 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.280
 unity facilitate stage in the composition 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 mostly light and medium technology 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.220
 while we have core three at once 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 heavy tank 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 Americans blowing t32 and one french 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 weaving Ukrainians settled in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 defense catch an opponent for mistakes and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.159
 counterattack correspondent turns 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 free and easily occupy the same 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 the center of the team exchange timid for 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.369
 flowers and theater of war 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 transferred to the island finding there t1 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.829
 cunningham 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.799
 and virginity Russians for a minute and a half 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.150
 before the end of the round go on the offensive 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.189
 however, it was here that were brought together 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 almost all enemy trunks 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.930
 hangar instantly sent buttercup and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 Diodorus and rhinos are transformed from the victim 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.640
 in the hunter of tyazha are thrown off 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.009
 places and hurry to attack but not finished 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.590
 the unity technique scatters in the corners and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.400
 keeps yourself alive the match score remains 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.280
 former 00 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.290
 the third fight on the ensk team leave 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.540
 mirrored with stages with two thirds and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.850
 yourself three hundred and a pair of fireflies 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.950
 scouts voyage is also symmetrical 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.840
 both teams parks a couple of tanks on 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.970
 X-ray advanced core strengths 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.620
 leave behind well familiar 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.570
 the script again no one is in a hurry 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 act number one and fight 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.770
 as if only rare shots died 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.140
 blindly remind crews 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.790
 tanks still in their jobs 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.320
 a minute and a half before the end of the round 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.360
 rhino is activated 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.190
 however time for a full disassembly 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.080
 again not enough draw 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.800
 so the fate of the match is decided on 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.410
 the following more dynamic maps 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.040
 fourth battle and so start 4 battle card 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.050
 himmelsdorf 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.150
 no one expected the first three cards 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.880
 They will be played out a draw and both teams 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.040
 will be very passive to act along the way 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.990
 the whole match as headquarters for this card 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.550
 was a suitable team for such tactics 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.650
 hastily did not think much about 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.270
 what they will do and acted as much as possible 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 just team unity turn 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.220
 uses standard setup with three 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.970
 weave as always send 1 mx 50 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.459
 100 on the mountain 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.380
 the rest of the equipment is sent to railway. and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.480
 after when the indy command is already 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.060
 I finally understand for myself what they are doing 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.489
 to sport they all their iron 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.239
 might into the city and begin to attack through 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.010
 card center 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.320
 on of course it sounded very funny 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.510
 information in timspike rhinos and yes they 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:31.600
 didn't wait for this attack from the centers yes not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:33.700
 will they come all come pay 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.860
 on soon got all the information they 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.670
 knew that they would attack but they 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.350
 didn't take advantage 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.540
 and unity did as it was necessary 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.340
 go to the west of the base and started a fight 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.320
 yes and when the team stopped by 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.840
 Nobody got capture here. 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.459
 the team left with minus on p1 and from in 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.100
 such a situation for a team that 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.690
 there is simply no chance of unity 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.170
 here they just replay the team on 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.600
 skill 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.280
 and you can say it just shoots at 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.320
 the end is one mistake from the team us feed 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.630
 cost them a fight and maybe the whole match 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.430
 well we have the cliffs left 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.390
 see if the rhinos can 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.510
 fix the last battle situation 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.940
 fifth fight seeing all these on the cliff unity 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.530
 take setup with object 416 and 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.200
 equip their base area 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 real fortress to the center of the map when 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.859
 This is only a pair of virgins. 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.230
 Russians switch to mode 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.390
 guerrilla warfare and waiting steps from 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.270
 rivals and rhinos trying to find 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.610
 approach to tank barricades unity ideas 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
 Ukrainians are born right on the battlefield 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.200
 try to set the burger on the mountain 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.220
 however the plan fails the power of the tank 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.740
 obviously not enough 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.960
 the passing time narrows the arsenal of tactics and 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.260
 rhinos are decided on the final attack by 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.240
 The center breaks a pair of mx 1390 however 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.820
 after a couple of seconds of virginity 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.340
 go to another world from despair 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.980
 without a goat and completely dumped off a cliff 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.110
 and unity do not destroy before the battered equipment let 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.070
 far from the most spectacular but deserved 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.380
 victory of unity 20 best demarche dealer 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.330
 urine becomes anatolich from unity on his 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.760
 account 6 half thousand caused 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.520
 Phryn's damage wins the scoring race 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.410
 with his well-aimed shots he destroyed 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.180
 seven units of enemy equipment 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.430
 about opposition scouts with 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.580
 minimum margin wins in ussr 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.350
 exactly ten lights Alexey what is it 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.060
 there was a crisis of the genre either simply 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.919
 no desire to attack one 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.510
 the other team well the reason was in us 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.790
 food as of course about joking match tour 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.890
 failed completely and after this game 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.630
 they did some analysis analysis was 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.910
 I notice such a team I was going there essence 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.650
 long-range attacks they did not take so simple 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.910
 and the setup they played neatly they 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.770
 understood that unity is a tough opponent 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.260
 low complex opponent need something 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.760
 do but they have something that's not this 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.010
 showed they did not show to can not 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.750
 cling to the game for the result by 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.669
 they played like an ordinary team 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.650
 just standards levashov than the problem 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.270
 unity command team unity did not have time 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.160
 adapt to the new regulations 10 but 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.770
 for the team were more familiar than 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.620
 the present 7 well and we say goodbye and wish 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.419
 teams of luck on the battlefield already in 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.910
 the next program is waiting for us to parse 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.770
 the battle between the leaders of the unity season and 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.770
 Mainz to new meetings bye
