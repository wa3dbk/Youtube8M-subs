scissors normally there's there's a way

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
scissors normally there's there's a way
to<00:00:51.420> prune<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> where<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.770> growth

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to prune it to where you get more growth

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.939 
to prune it to where you get more growth
like<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> way<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.410> grown<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> lot

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like this the way it is it's grown a lot

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
like this the way it is it's grown a lot
and<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.629> I'll<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and you know I'll just go over that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
and you know I'll just go over that
really<00:00:58.649> quick<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.940> I'll

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
really quick with you and then I'll

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.900 
really quick with you and then I'll
start<00:01:00.780> harvesting<00:01:01.219> right<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.760> going

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
start harvesting right now I'm not going

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
start harvesting right now I'm not going
to<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> basically<00:01:04.110> prune<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to I'm not going to basically prune it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
to I'm not going to basically prune it
for<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.040> growth<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.820> exploding

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
for more growth because it's exploding

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
for more growth because it's exploding
with<00:01:06.540> growth<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> heads

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with growth but if you look at the heads

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.840 
with growth but if you look at the heads
here<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> heads<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.670> down

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
here see you see the heads right down

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580 
here see you see the heads right down
underneath<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> heads<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.260> these

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
underneath the heads there's these

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.910 
underneath the heads there's these
little<00:01:14.060> Junction<00:01:15.060> spots<00:01:15.450> basically<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
little Junction spots basically and so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
little Junction spots basically and so
what<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> were<00:01:18.479> going

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
what you want to do is if you were going

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
what you want to do is if you were going
to<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.799> growth<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to want to get more growth out of it you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.260 
to want to get more growth out of it you
would<00:01:20.700> cut<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
would cut it right there okay and then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.109 
would cut it right there okay and then
what<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> does<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> allows<00:01:25.259> these<00:01:25.560> two

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
what that does that allows these two

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.800 
what that does that allows these two
offshoots<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.259> produce<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.720> then<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
offshoots here to produce and then you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.999 
offshoots here to produce and then you
have<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> dry<00:01:31.939> okay<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> can

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have this you can dry okay so so I can

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
have this you can dry okay so so I can
go<00:01:35.100> through<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.450> look<00:01:36.659> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
go through that and do that but look if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
go through that and do that but look if
you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> lower<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.579> let's<00:01:38.759> say<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you want to do it lower so let's say you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.550 
you want to do it lower so let's say you
wanted<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.750> head<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
wanted to do the whole head here and you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
wanted to do the whole head here and you
want<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> growth

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
want it to get really a lot of growth

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.850 
want it to get really a lot of growth
you<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.649> there's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you just go to down okay because there's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.350 
you just go to down okay because there's
different<00:01:47.189> junctions<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.119> here's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
different junctions so see here's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.139 
different junctions so see here's
another<00:01:48.600> Junction<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.159> catnip

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
another Junction here and it has catnip

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
another Junction here and it has catnip
there<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> heavy

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there so but I'm going to do a heavy

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
there so but I'm going to do a heavy
harvest<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.790> worry<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.420> dying

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
harvest and not worry about it dying

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.160 
harvest and not worry about it dying
because<00:01:55.040> it's<00:01:56.040> grown<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.509> let's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
because it's grown really good so let's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520 
because it's grown really good so let's
go<00:01:58.290> ahead<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.590> start<00:01:59.159> harvesting<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.530> how

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
go ahead and start harvesting it and how

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.899 
go ahead and start harvesting it and how
I'm<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> basically<00:02:02.490> be

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.290 

there's<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.800> ways<00:02:14.070> oh<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> tray

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
there's two ways oh this is the tray

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.110 
there's two ways oh this is the tray
that<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.570> use<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:17.070> dry<00:02:17.370> things<00:02:17.430> there's<00:02:17.940> two

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that I use to dry things there's two

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630 
that I use to dry things there's two
things<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:19.080> used<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.560> tray<00:02:19.890> which<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> an

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
things that I used this tray which is an

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.820 
things that I used this tray which is an
old<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:23.850> animal<00:02:24.720> pee<00:02:25.320> tray

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
old like animal pee tray

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.740 
old like animal pee tray
but<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.460> never<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.850> used<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> just

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
but it never got used for that so I just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.720 
but it never got used for that so I just
ended<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.260> using<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.860> drying<00:02:29.070> stuff<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
ended up using it for drying stuff and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
ended up using it for drying stuff and
then<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> grates<00:02:31.320> over<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.010> lights

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
then you know the grates over the lights

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.390 
then you know the grates over the lights
in<00:02:33.470> houses<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.650> stuff<00:02:34.800> well<00:02:34.980> anyway<00:02:35.220> that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
in houses and stuff well anyway that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.730 
in houses and stuff well anyway that
grate<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:36.750> basically<00:02:37.110> going<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> hold<00:02:37.590> down

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
grate is basically going to hold down

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.340 
grate is basically going to hold down
the<00:02:37.800> catnip<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:39.000> putting<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.600> catnip<00:02:40.170> on

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the catnip I was putting the catnip on

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.750 
the catnip I was putting the catnip on
top<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.800> drying<00:02:41.070> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
top and drying it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.080 
top and drying it
this<00:02:42.120> basically<00:02:42.540> gathers<00:02:43.020> heat<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
this basically gathers heat and then the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
this basically gathers heat and then the
grate<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:46.050> kind<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.350> holds<00:02:46.650> things<00:02:46.800> down<00:02:47.100> or

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
grate just kind of holds things down or

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.820 
grate just kind of holds things down or
it<00:02:47.370> was<00:02:47.460> something<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.850> keep<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.480> catnip<00:02:49.230> away

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it was something to keep the catnip away

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
it was something to keep the catnip away
from<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.790> heat<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:52.170> anyways<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.910> catnip

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
from the heat but anyways so this catnip

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.600 
from the heat but anyways so this catnip
basically<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.770> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
basically is going to go on here and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.980 
basically is going to go on here and
there's<00:02:56.760> two<00:02:56.820> ways<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.960> you

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
there's two ways you can do this one you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.010 
there's two ways you can do this one you
could<00:02:58.230> pull<00:02:58.470> off<00:02:58.500> all<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> leaves<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.810> then

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
could pull off all the leaves and then

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.900 
could pull off all the leaves and then
just<00:03:01.380> avoid<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.890> stems<00:03:02.130> because<00:03:02.370> it'll<00:03:02.730> dry

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
just avoid the stems because it'll dry

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.090 
just avoid the stems because it'll dry
faster<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.540> way<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> don't<00:03:04.560> do<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.920> with

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
faster that way but I don't do that with

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.250 
faster that way but I don't do that with
this<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.210> leave<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:06.930> tell<00:03:07.170> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
this because I leave it out and tell it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
this because I leave it out and tell it
to<00:03:07.350> dry<00:03:07.560> its<00:03:07.830> catnip<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.490> not<00:03:08.640> something

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to dry its catnip it's not something

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.080 
to dry its catnip it's not something
that<00:03:09.150> I'm<00:03:09.300> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> eat<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.190> I'll<00:03:11.730> leave<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that I'm going to eat so I'll leave it

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.940 
that I'm going to eat so I'll leave it
out<00:03:12.210> for<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> long<00:03:12.600> time<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.170> let<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.350> get<00:03:13.530> really

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
out for a long time to let it get really

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.950 
out for a long time to let it get really
dry<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.730> long<00:03:14.910> time<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.810> will

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
dry and a long time this all this will

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.610 
dry and a long time this all this will
be<00:03:16.080> dry<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.680> two<00:03:17.250> days<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.900> little

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
be dry in like two days with this little

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
be dry in like two days with this little
system<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.550> basically<00:03:20.850> lay<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.300> all<00:03:21.420> out

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
system so I basically lay it all out

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.050 
system so I basically lay it all out
like<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.020> try<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.920> keep<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.520> thin<00:03:23.790> layer

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
like this try to keep it on a thin layer

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.390 
like this try to keep it on a thin layer
as<00:03:24.360> thin<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:24.960> possible<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.860> want<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> keep<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
as thin as possible you want to keep it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.350 
as thin as possible you want to keep it
at<00:03:26.490> about<00:03:26.580> an<00:03:26.880> inch<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.580> just<00:03:29.940> lay<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.210> all

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
at about an inch so I just lay it all

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.160 
at about an inch so I just lay it all
out<00:03:30.390> like<00:03:30.750> this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.590 

the<00:03:34.170> thinner<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.680> layer<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.850> faster<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> will

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
the thinner the layer the faster it will

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.870 
the thinner the layer the faster it will
dry<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:36.930> well<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:39.270> is<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.480> lot<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.020> catnip

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
dry as well so this is a lot of catnip

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.540 
dry as well so this is a lot of catnip
more<00:03:41.880> than<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.090> normally<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:43.280> but<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.310> haven't

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
more than I normally do but I haven't

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.850 
more than I normally do but I haven't
harvested<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.210> a<00:03:45.240> while<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:45.810> why<00:03:48.530> all<00:03:49.530> this

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
harvested in a while that's why all this

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.880 
harvested in a while that's why all this
on<00:03:50.130> here

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
on here

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.320 
on here
you<00:03:52.890> know<00:03:52.980> why<00:03:53.190> buy<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.090> when<00:03:54.240> you

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
you know why buy it you know when you

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.230 
you know why buy it you know when you
can<00:03:54.480> grow<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.160> organic<00:03:56.520> catnip<00:03:57.030> as

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
can grow it this is organic catnip as

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.330 
can grow it this is organic catnip as
well<00:03:57.500> non-gmo<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.680> actually<00:03:59.070> found<00:03:59.460> it<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:01.340> it

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
well non-gmo I actually found it and it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.390 
well non-gmo I actually found it and it
it<00:04:02.910> comes<00:04:03.360> back<00:04:03.480> every<00:04:03.690> year<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:05.370> have

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
it comes back every year and we have

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.490 
it comes back every year and we have
tons<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:08.180> there<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.300> have<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:12.500> okay

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
tons of it so there you have it and okay

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.320 
tons of it so there you have it and okay
so<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:14.010> leave<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.459> on<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.670> stem<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:14.940> there's<00:04:15.240> a

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
so I leave it on the stem and there's a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.349 
so I leave it on the stem and there's a
reason<00:04:15.690> why<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.290> reason<00:04:16.440> why<00:04:16.770> is<00:04:16.830> because

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
reason why the reason why is because

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.090 
reason why the reason why is because
once<00:04:18.359> it's<00:04:18.540> dry<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.380> don't<00:04:19.500> want<00:04:19.710> to<00:04:19.799> try<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
once it's dry you don't want to try and

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.010 
once it's dry you don't want to try and
pick<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:20.430> leaves<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.970> are<00:04:21.090> dry<00:04:21.359> especially

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
pick up leaves that are dry especially

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.690 
pick up leaves that are dry especially
these<00:04:22.350> catnip<00:04:22.800> leaves<00:04:23.040> because<00:04:23.310> they're<00:04:23.490> just

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
these catnip leaves because they're just

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.450 
these catnip leaves because they're just

brittle<00:04:25.449> you<00:04:25.660> know<00:04:26.069> here's<00:04:27.069> some<00:04:27.310> right<00:04:27.550> here

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
brittle you know here's some right here

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.990 
brittle you know here's some right here
and<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:29.139> basically<00:04:29.740> use<00:04:30.069> the<00:04:30.280> stems<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.729> pick

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
and I basically use the stems to pick

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.420 
and I basically use the stems to pick
them<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.240> like<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:32.470> I'll<00:04:33.160> show<00:04:33.220> you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
them up like that and then I'll show you

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.920 
them up like that and then I'll show you
what<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.580> do<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:33.789> a<00:04:33.849> second<00:04:34.240> but<00:04:34.419> basically<00:04:34.630> all

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
what I do in a second but basically all

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.309 
what I do in a second but basically all
that's<00:04:35.259> done<00:04:35.530> see<00:04:35.979> it's<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.250> laid<00:04:36.430> out<00:04:36.580> and

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
that's done see it's all laid out and

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.589 
that's done see it's all laid out and
then<00:04:38.319> you<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.620> get<00:04:38.710> these<00:04:38.889> grates<00:04:39.819> like<00:04:40.479> I

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
then you can get these grates like I

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.350 
then you can get these grates like I
said<00:04:40.840> at<00:04:40.990> Home<00:04:41.139> Depot<00:04:41.530> or<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:43.919> Home<00:04:44.919> Depot<00:04:45.310> or

wash or whatever whatever hardware
stores<00:04:48.880> around<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.509> you<00:04:50.229> basically<00:04:50.470> just

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
stores around and you basically just

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.070 
stores around and you basically just
leave<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.610> on<00:04:51.669> there<00:04:51.880> like<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.300> put<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:52.930> out

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
leave it on there like that put it out

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.839 
leave it on there like that put it out
in<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.259> Sun<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.770> within<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.250> day<00:04:54.430> or<00:04:54.460> two<00:04:54.580> it's

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
in the Sun and within a day or two it's

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.629 
in the Sun and within a day or two it's
done<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.389> gets<00:04:56.380> dried<00:04:56.650> up<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:56.979> it's<00:04:57.070> it's<00:04:57.370> fine

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
done it gets dried up and it's it's fine

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.879 
done it gets dried up and it's it's fine
so<00:05:00.509> see<00:05:01.509> that<00:05:01.720> one<00:05:01.930> hand<00:05:02.199> I'm<00:05:02.410> opening<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
so see that one hand I'm opening the

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.430 
so see that one hand I'm opening the
catnip<00:05:03.250> jar<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.090> basically<00:05:04.449> after<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.810> you

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
catnip jar so basically after that you

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.980 
catnip jar so basically after that you
would<00:05:05.590> take<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:06.039> catnip<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:07.330> then<00:05:07.780> you<00:05:07.870> can

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
would take the catnip and then you can

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.010 
would take the catnip and then you can
just<00:05:08.110> crush<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.560> up<00:05:08.680> stem<00:05:09.009> and<00:05:09.160> all<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:10.870> you

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
just crush it up stem and all if you

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.770 
just crush it up stem and all if you
want<00:05:11.199> to<00:05:11.289> get<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.500> stems<00:05:11.770> out<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:12.009> it<00:05:12.220> you<00:05:12.340> just

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
want to get the stems out of it you just

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.600 
want to get the stems out of it you just
you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:13.900> go<00:05:13.990> ahead<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.199> do<00:05:14.349> that<00:05:14.610> but

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
you can go ahead and do that but

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.520 
you can go ahead and do that but
