00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
right it's not that's really slow but it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.770 
right it's not that's really slow but it
does<00:04:24.560> focus<00:04:24.860> on<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.790> subject<00:04:26.240> before<00:04:26.360> it

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
does focus on the subject before it

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.620 
does focus on the subject before it
snaps<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.410> photo<00:04:27.890> but<00:04:28.250> pretty<00:04:28.520> smooth<00:04:29.360> next

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
snaps the photo but pretty smooth next

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.200

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.140 
same quality or the 5 megapixel it's
really<00:04:35.150> fast<00:04:35.450> maybe<00:04:35.780> it's<00:04:35.990> taking<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.410> shot<00:04:37.150> all
