00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.290
 new video tutorial 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.700
 today we see how the ringtone changes 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.669
 then you set a ringtone 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.610
 personalized on our iphone that is 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.460
 from four onwards with a system 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.419
 operating ios 5 onwards including ios 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.219
 ios 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.870
 6 to do this you will need itunes then 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.180
 this process can be done both with mac 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.650
 that pc 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.970
 let's go first connect 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.590
 the iphone our mac or pc based on 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.560
 what you have anymode open itunes 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.860
 always if it won't open by itself let's go 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.960
 then on music and we choose a song there 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:02.710
 song we want to turn into 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.289
 ringer 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:32.249
 at this point we are going to check the point 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.249
 of fair order we put zero points 30 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.130
