00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 Yes hello 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 today I have something very hot for 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 I do not mind you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.640
 wants to withhold and that with 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 Tires for the re where 128 of practice 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:29.250
 Look at it so incredibly so far 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.309
 I have not seen any with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.719
 So it will be fine 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.860
 the first ones are the rims of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.760
 axial oversize the big ones for the once 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:54.780
 Eighth and foam rubber is japan foam rubber 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:58.859
 front 38 rear 36 and of the most 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.410
 I hope that tires at 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.309
 high speeds I with 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.320
 Six, just do not live 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.939
 mature ballooning more arises and that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 I grip more than usual 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 I could not stop myself and I 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.860
 the tire flanks just ein 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 bit labeled with white color 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.259
 some of you will become one 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 probably ask what does he have there 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.090
 now on the tire wall 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 written on it so the enlightenment 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.630
 Latin means alea iacta est 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.650
 as much as the dice has fallen 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.659
 that's often enough, wrongly 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 even with the dice have fallen 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.799
 translated but that's just not true 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:52.439
 because it would number up to you healthy 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:57.390
 So plural so there you have probably 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:01.009
 looking forward to the rear tire cities 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 another famous Latin saying 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.049
 veni vidi vici i came i saw i 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.720
 won 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.160
 but that should actually 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.370
 I got to be think I once and that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.800
 has not been translated incorrectly 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 and here you can see again 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.180
 that it does not drag anything 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.580
 fits perfectly that's right 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.860
 class I was before I mature 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 I was a bit mounted 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.460
 skeptical if that really is everything 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.870
 fits and does not drag somehow though 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.990
 There are no problems with the tires 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:54.530
 are just fully hit and that 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:59.000
 definitely works on the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.320
 We also look at the other side again 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.830
 how is it then in practice 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.830
 beats
