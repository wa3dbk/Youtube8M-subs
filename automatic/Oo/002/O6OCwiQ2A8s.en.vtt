00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello it does not matter if you are New Year's Eve or you gum 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 Wester like I was first I got you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 a few outfits and also a fitting one 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.910
 we won make up and that's how we catch it 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.280
 also on 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 First, I'm wearing an attitude 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.099
 based on all the products left the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 infobox 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.930
 so that I do not believe so many then 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 I take a light brown eyeshadow 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 and then so deluded in the edge 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.599
 still a clean fluffy brush around 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.400
 just do it again everything better 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.230
 then I blind one 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 dark gray sparkling eye shadow and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 Gives him in the outer corner of my eye 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 and then it gets dazzled again 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.149
 actually always dazzle 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.149
 apply dazzle 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.720
 then I take a slightly lighter 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 bluish shimmering silver glittering 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.190
 Eyeshadow and distributed on the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 movable lid especially easy 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 to indicate more and more glitter because it is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 New Year's Eve then I go again 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.900
 this dark gray league falls over 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.390
 to reinforce everything a bit more 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.400
 and associations again next goal 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.580
 more in one stroke with a gel 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 eyeliner and then makes such a small 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:18.149
 quiet but you can of course 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:21.149
 let's get started then I have 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.670
 here's another glitter liner of it 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.170
 not great but works 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 I just give it to mine again 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 black on each other for even more 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 glitter around the eyes yet 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.690
 to open something I give a white one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.500
 kajal on the waterline and then still 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.509
 in the inner eye angle and with one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 matte dark gray tone I just go 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 again to the lower lash line then 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.509
 of course, will still be the eyelashes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.490
 showered and of course you can too 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.869
 not correct 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.400
 since I'm one of bay grabbing you something too 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.750
 bright and one that is a bit too dark 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.130
 I just want you together and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 Then you wear with my youtube countries 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.570
 look at her is this complete look 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.460
 very strong you can of course you 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.810
 also vary the danger of having a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 high opacity that can be the course 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 Let's make fun of this look 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:16.040
 is just silvester just a lot 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:18.080
 there is more we then I still pull myself 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340
 my eyebrows after kempter one more 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.239
 Just go ahead with it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.239
 look more natural 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.739
 and then the face is competing 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.519
 then cooler not so much too 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.280
 shine because was only the right one 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.689
 unlimited questions and not to the usa 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.620
 a lot of bacon save who else blush 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.620
 apply 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.480
 if you can apply a lot of highlighter 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.950
 then on sylvester this look is on 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.630
 Of course, rather for New Year's Eve thought 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 I can also connect it to gammel vest 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.250
 wear yes what's up at all gammel 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.290

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.320

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.230

 Of course, even if you somehow send 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.320
 New Years Eve party I had one 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.000
 length and you know no pants 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 That's why I just have one more 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.490
 sweatpants pulled over it and that yes 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.140

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.030
 not so satisfied yes then 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.240
 Of course, there is still outfit number 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.280
 Two here I have a cream sweater 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.560
 I still put on my sweatpants 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.450
 Also important are thick socks and me 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.250
 do not really have the sweater wrong 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.790
 man but the bag actually belongs 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.040
 front yes, stupid if I sometimes 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.440
 the political was still not 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.000
 happy with this outfit 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.180
 okay, there is also still out for the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.310
 numbers 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.350
 a nice rudi then i have one 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.630
 leggins but I still have a long time 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.580
 black top attracted so that the po 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 It is almost covered by this 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.080
 Keller rock but it is just mega mega 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.020
 comfortable of the whole course 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.030
 fitting even color yes and if we 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.680
 now six best defeats that is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.330
 nothing for me 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.620
 of course I have mine 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.200
 nice clothes rack also a few 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.140
 dresses and look what I'm doing 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.930
 sequin magic will make you perfect for 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:49.770
 New Year's Eve we look dressed 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.770
 I think it's really nice 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.510
 yes it has the nice back cut 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.130
 that perfectly suits when a 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.540
 updo course contributes to it 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.570
 I had to really have no desire 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.100
 the extraction and yaz just glitter 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.660
 really the perfect dress for 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.730
 New Year's eve I have never had it 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.590
 yes, good that I have something but 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.330
 do not wear it but i think it knows 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.680
 Of course, there is still something about it 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.210
 can meet some down to 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.520
 just to the black cardigan over it 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.690
 put on and then it's a bit 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.790
 less chic then you can of course 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.500
 miss her to dress there i would have 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.930
 now the pretty found or too 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.000
 and if you never say that it's too 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.380
 of course you can sock crazy 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.740
 Don't get dressed, though 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.480
 still on 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.430
 without just any ankle boots 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.510
 and if I still is not 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.660
 like I have here are a 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.640
 something chic outfit so that's one 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.260
 I would be okay now 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.570
 it is not a mix at gammel westers 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.610
 quite different but a statement chain 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.510
 black top in white blazer or 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.910
 another color 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.000
 then I have every second shorts that 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.640
 also there must have been stitched in the front 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.170
 then I put on little boes 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.760
 or you can of course again 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.540
 your ankle boots or whatever 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.540
 move in to 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.280
 and now you are asked i want to 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.380
