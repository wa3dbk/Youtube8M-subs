really<00:00:33.050> interested<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.380> test<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:33.739> out<00:00:33.829> for<00:00:34.010> a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
really interested to test it out for a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.100 
really interested to test it out for a
few<00:00:34.250> reasons<00:00:34.309> they<00:00:35.210> say<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.660> has<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.810> stay

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
few reasons they say that it has a stay

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.860 
few reasons they say that it has a stay
clean<00:00:36.500> edge<00:00:36.940> which<00:00:37.940> means<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:38.450> if<00:00:38.630> you<00:00:38.690> dump

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
clean edge which means that if you dump

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720 
clean edge which means that if you dump
it<00:00:38.960> in<00:00:39.080> your<00:00:39.170> phone<00:00:39.380> over<00:00:39.590> time<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.280> shouldn't

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
it in your phone over time it shouldn't

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.850 
it in your phone over time it shouldn't
acquire<00:00:40.970> lint<00:00:41.330> or<00:00:41.510> hopefully<00:00:42.350> not<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.680> much

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
acquire lint or hopefully not that much

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.800 
acquire lint or hopefully not that much
Lynn<00:00:43.130> if<00:00:43.310> you've<00:00:43.760> ever<00:00:43.880> had<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.420> screen

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
Lynn if you've ever had a screen

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.660 
Lynn if you've ever had a screen
protector<00:00:44.930> on<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.380> cell<00:00:45.560> phone<00:00:45.590> before<00:00:45.950> you

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
protector on a cell phone before you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.010 
protector on a cell phone before you
would<00:00:46.820> know<00:00:46.970> that<00:00:47.000> about<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.390> week<00:00:47.570> later<00:00:47.600> it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
would know that about a week later it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.470 
would know that about a week later it
starts<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.320> look<00:00:48.350> kind<00:00:48.590> of<00:00:48.710> dingy<00:00:49.310> and<00:00:49.579> dirty

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.550 
so hopefully that's a one of the things

film here or two as a squeegee all right

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.080 
film here or two as a squeegee all right
let's<00:01:51.560> do<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:54.520> nice<00:01:55.520> little<00:01:55.760> simple

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
let's do this nice little simple

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.480 
let's do this nice little simple
packaging<00:01:56.510> here<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.869> have<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:57.619> looks<00:01:58.340> like<00:01:58.430> i

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
packaging here I have one looks like i

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.030 
packaging here I have one looks like i
have<00:01:58.520> one<00:01:58.880> screen<00:01:59.150> protector<00:02:02.740> let's<00:02:03.740> open

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
have one screen protector let's open

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.469 
have one screen protector let's open
that<00:02:04.100> up<00:02:04.750> up<00:02:05.750> there's<00:02:06.020> two<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.200> them<00:02:06.820> numero<00:02:07.820> do

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
that up up there's two of them numero do

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.550 
that up up there's two of them numero do
so<00:02:08.750> deuce<00:02:10.239> alright<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:11.959> let's<00:02:12.109> figure<00:02:12.379> this

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
so deuce alright so let's figure this

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.490 
so deuce alright so let's figure this
out

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
out

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.020 
out
now<00:02:15.500> even<00:02:15.800> though<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:15.980> cleaned<00:02:16.400> off<00:02:16.610> your

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
now even though you cleaned off your

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.240 
now even though you cleaned off your
iPhone<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.780> might<00:02:17.930> want<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.230> make<00:02:18.350> sure<00:02:18.380> that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
iPhone you might want to make sure that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.220 
iPhone you might want to make sure that
there's<00:02:19.400> no<00:02:19.610> dust<00:02:19.970> attached<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:20.990> as<00:02:21.200> well

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
there's no dust attached to this as well

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.640 
there's no dust attached to this as well
because<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.490> will<00:02:22.610> show<00:02:22.850> up<00:02:22.970> over<00:02:23.150> time<00:02:23.650> so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
because that will show up over time so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.700 
because that will show up over time so
this<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.830> how<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:25.250> put<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:27.170> got<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.350> peel
