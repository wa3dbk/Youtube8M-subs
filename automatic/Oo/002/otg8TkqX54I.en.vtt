it's alone iam sulfate as fertilizer as
a<00:00:51.579> carrier<00:00:52.059> but<00:00:52.719> what<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:52.930> granule<00:00:53.469> does<00:00:53.859> better

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
a carrier but what a granule does better

all<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.340> that's<00:02:37.730> how<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> control

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
all that and that's how you control

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.160 
all that and that's how you control
scorpions<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.290> everything<00:02:40.010> else
