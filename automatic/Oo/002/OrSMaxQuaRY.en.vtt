00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.210 
hey guys started these ruins last week
after<00:00:05.420> watching<00:00:05.600> all<00:00:06.109> three<00:00:06.440> movies<00:00:06.620> I<00:00:06.859> went

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
after watching all three movies I went

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.030 
after watching all three movies I went
for<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:07.580> whole<00:00:07.759> marathon<00:00:08.500> so<00:00:09.500> that<00:00:09.650> took<00:00:09.830> up

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
for the whole marathon so that took up

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.870 
for the whole marathon so that took up
quite<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.310> chunk<00:00:10.580> of<00:00:10.700> my<00:00:10.820> time<00:00:10.850> I<00:00:12.400> went<00:00:13.400> for<00:00:13.760> the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
quite a chunk of my time I went for the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.050 
quite a chunk of my time I went for the
Oscars<00:00:14.420> ruins<00:00:15.050> and<00:00:15.440> because<00:00:16.309> well<00:00:16.940> I've

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
Oscars ruins and because well I've

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.300 
Oscars ruins and because well I've
always<00:00:17.270> wanted<00:00:17.780> to<00:00:18.140> make<00:00:18.440> some<00:00:18.680> train<00:00:19.010> for

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
always wanted to make some train for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.529 
always wanted to make some train for
that<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:19.820> while<00:00:20.690> aboard<00:00:21.140> really<00:00:21.620> and<00:00:22.480> so<00:00:23.480> I

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
that and while aboard really and so I

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.840 
that and while aboard really and so I
thought<00:00:23.810> I'd<00:00:23.960> I'd<00:00:24.380> give<00:00:24.770> it<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.920> shot

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
thought I'd I'd give it a shot

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.540 
thought I'd I'd give it a shot
I<00:00:25.880> used<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.050> many<00:00:27.110> methods<00:00:27.770> for<00:00:28.010> making<00:00:28.369> this

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
I used so many methods for making this

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.260 
I used so many methods for making this
um<00:00:28.940> because<00:00:29.930> I've<00:00:30.860> never<00:00:31.430> done<00:00:31.610> it<00:00:31.789> in<00:00:31.970> foam

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
um because I've never done it in foam

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.040 
um because I've never done it in foam
board<00:00:32.599> foam<00:00:33.380> core<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:35.000> fact<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.480> always<00:00:35.750> used

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
board foam core in fact I always used

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.370 
board foam core in fact I always used
the<00:00:36.230> Hirst<00:00:36.440> arts<00:00:36.680> box<00:00:37.160> because<00:00:37.520> they<00:00:37.760> were

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
the Hirst arts box because they were

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.810 
the Hirst arts box because they were
easier<00:00:39.670> so<00:00:40.670> I'll<00:00:41.239> show<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:41.870> I've<00:00:41.960> got

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
easier so I'll show you what I've got

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.490 
easier so I'll show you what I've got
and<00:00:43.820> here<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.680> used<00:00:45.730> foam<00:00:46.730> board<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.630> then<00:00:48.230> I

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
and here I used foam board and then I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.040 
and here I used foam board and then I
cut<00:00:48.860> in<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.130> bricks<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.940> I've<00:00:50.510> always<00:00:50.690> had<00:00:50.870> a

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
cut in the bricks and I've always had a

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.880 
cut in the bricks and I've always had a
problem<00:00:51.380> with<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.130> bricks<00:00:52.430> because<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:54.559> looks

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
problem with the bricks because it looks

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.819 
problem with the bricks because it looks
really<00:00:55.309> crap<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:56.350> paper<00:00:58.570> what<00:00:59.570> I<00:00:59.809> did<00:01:00.140> was<00:01:00.500> I

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
really crap on paper what I did was I

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.479 
really crap on paper what I did was I
first<00:01:02.739> drew<00:01:03.739> where<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.100> bricks<00:01:04.309> were<00:01:04.429> going

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
first drew where the bricks were going

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.050 
first drew where the bricks were going
to<00:01:04.789> be<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.329> then<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.469> with<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.039> sharp<00:01:07.729> knife

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
to be and then I with a sharp knife

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.459 
to be and then I with a sharp knife
I<00:01:08.420> just<00:01:08.840> cut<00:01:09.259> into<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.009> paper<00:01:10.249> and<00:01:10.549> then<00:01:11.469> put

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
I just cut into the paper and then put

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.199 
I just cut into the paper and then put
my<00:01:12.530> pencil<00:01:12.920> right<00:01:13.609> along<00:01:13.999> and<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:16.490> can<00:01:16.969> see

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
my pencil right along and you can see

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.249 
my pencil right along and you can see
Mike<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:17.749> that<00:01:17.899> there<00:01:18.109> so<00:01:18.859> that<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:19.219> made<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
Mike so that there so that it made the

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.129 
Mike so that there so that it made the
spaces<00:01:21.259> like<00:01:21.859> deeper<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.579> could<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:24.020> it

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
spaces like deeper so you could see it

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:28.599 
spaces like deeper so you could see it
easier<00:01:25.090> after<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.719> started<00:01:27.709> getting<00:01:28.039> the

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
easier after that I started getting the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.539 
easier after that I started getting the
ruined<00:01:28.939> effect<00:01:29.359> and<00:01:29.709> added<00:01:30.709> on<00:01:30.859> my<00:01:31.099> pillars

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
ruined effect and added on my pillars

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.389 
ruined effect and added on my pillars
and<00:01:31.999> such<00:01:32.509> which<00:01:33.200> are<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.829> hair<00:01:34.009> starts

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
and such which are from the hair starts

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.580 
and such which are from the hair starts
in<00:01:34.609> fact<00:01:35.499> and<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.569> then<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.719> could<00:01:38.929> just<00:01:38.959> go<00:01:39.349> on

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
in fact and and then I could just go on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.059 
in fact and and then I could just go on
to<00:01:39.799> painting<00:01:40.749> I'm<00:01:41.749> here<00:01:42.170> we've<00:01:42.289> got<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.499> window

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
a window piece and I don't even know

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.559 
a window piece and I don't even know
what<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.479> layout<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:47.929> gonna<00:01:48.109> look<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.649> yet

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
and because I don't know I never draw my

because<00:02:33.730> often<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.500> model<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.070> too

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
because often when you have model is too

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.140 
because often when you have model is too
big<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.700> gets<00:02:37.140> bulky<00:02:38.160> hearts<00:02:39.160> store<00:02:39.550> and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
big it gets bulky hearts store and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.780 
big it gets bulky hearts store and
actually<00:02:40.740> it's<00:02:41.740> strange<00:02:42.250> what<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.520> doesn't

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
actually it's strange what it doesn't

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.580 
actually it's strange what it doesn't
make<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.150> fun<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.810> play<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.440> because

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
make it that fun to play on just because

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.670 
make it that fun to play on just because
it's<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.730> big<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.750> I'm<00:02:49.870> gonna<00:02:50.080> try<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.410> get<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
it's so big so I'm gonna try and get the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's so big so I'm gonna try and get the
rest<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.190> finished<00:02:51.520> soon<00:02:51.880> since<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.390> on

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
holidays Christmas holidays that we get

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.770 
holidays Christmas holidays that we get
at<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> moment<00:02:56.680> though<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.550> need<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.270> cast<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
at the moment though I need to cast a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.210 
at the moment though I need to cast a
few<00:02:58.990> more<00:02:59.260> a<00:03:00.240> few<00:03:01.240> more<00:03:01.600> pillars<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:02.830> cuz<00:03:03.070> I

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
few more a few more pillars here cuz I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.680 
few more a few more pillars here cuz I
ironic<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.480> use<00:03:04.690> them<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:06.690> I'll

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
ironic and use them all and I'll

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.670 
ironic and use them all and I'll
probably<00:03:07.960> make<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.650> into<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.210> one<00:03:10.210> piece

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
probably make this into one one piece

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.520 
probably make this into one one piece
and<00:03:11.680> glue<00:03:11.860> onto<00:03:12.270> onto<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.540> board<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.410> I've

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
and glue onto onto a board so that I've

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.900 
and glue onto onto a board so that I've
got<00:03:14.710> a<00:03:14.740> nice<00:03:14.980> ruin<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:17.100> also<00:03:18.100> I've<00:03:18.640> got

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
got a nice ruin and then also I've got

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.240 
got a nice ruin and then also I've got
there's<00:03:19.570> still<00:03:19.870> quite<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.230> lot<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.740> do<00:03:20.890> in<00:03:20.980> fact

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
there's still quite a lot to do in fact

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.700 
there's still quite a lot to do in fact
because<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.540> need<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.810> get<00:03:22.960> both<00:03:23.230> sides

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
because you need to get both sides

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.200 
because you need to get both sides
because<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> moment<00:03:24.640> there's<00:03:24.760> nothing<00:03:25.060> on

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
because at the moment there's nothing on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.840 
because at the moment there's nothing on
the<00:03:25.300> backs<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:28.470> because<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:30.340> know<00:03:30.460> it<00:03:30.670> just

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
the backs and because you know it just

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.450 
the backs and because you know it just
look<00:03:31.000> hard<00:03:31.240> otherwise<00:03:31.810> having<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
look hard otherwise having just the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.570 
look hard otherwise having just the
front<00:03:33.700> done<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.440> gonna<00:03:35.740> take<00:03:36.250> twice<00:03:36.550> as

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
front done so it's gonna take twice as

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.350 
front done so it's gonna take twice as
long<00:03:36.790> with<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.710> foam<00:03:38.710> board<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:40.090> with

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
long with this foam board because with

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
just put them down you've got both sides

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.310 
just put them down you've got both sides
already<00:03:46.090> all<00:03:46.270> done<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.810> looks<00:03:46.990> pretty
