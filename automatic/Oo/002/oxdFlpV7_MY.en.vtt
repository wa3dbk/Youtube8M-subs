00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
to be identical to what we saw in wolf's

generous<00:02:59.320> custom<00:02:59.710> so<00:02:59.860> far<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
generous custom so far so you think that

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.010 
generous custom so far so you think that
that<00:03:00.970> could<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.270> been<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> B<00:03:01.780> plate

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
anyway you are going to have two weapons

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.730 
anyway you are going to have two weapons
here<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.540> could<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.020> wheeled<00:03:05.380> if<00:03:05.620> you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
here so you could do a wheeled if you

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.020 
here so you could do a wheeled if you
really<00:03:05.980> wanted<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> make<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.550> guy<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> lot

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
really wanted to make this guy a lot

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.090 
really wanted to make this guy a lot

to<00:06:04.440> be<00:06:04.560> an<00:06:04.650> improvement<00:06:04.770> since<00:06:05.250> it's<00:06:05.430> based<00:06:05.610> on

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
to be an improvement since it's based on

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.610 
to be an improvement since it's based on
the<00:06:05.880> age<00:06:06.000> one<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:06.900> how<00:06:07.050> great<00:06:07.200> would<00:06:07.380> it<00:06:07.440> be<00:06:07.530> to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
the age one but how great would it be to

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.170 
the age one but how great would it be to
have<00:06:07.800> both<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.100> these<00:06:08.310> guys<00:06:08.580> in<00:06:08.790> blue<00:06:09.000> or

purple diva colors which would really

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.159 
purple diva colors which would really
help<00:06:11.490> build<00:06:11.880> up<00:06:12.030> your<00:06:12.060> army<00:06:12.510> if<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:12.780> wanted<00:06:13.050> to

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
to do with it for 600 yen you can't

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.620 
to do with it for 600 yen you can't
really<00:06:34.710> go<00:06:34.919> wrong<00:06:34.949> with<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:36.030> has<00:06:36.300> all<00:06:36.509> the

really go wrong with this it has all the

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.029 
really go wrong with this it has all the
same<00:06:36.780> things<00:06:37.020> that<00:06:37.110> I<00:06:37.199> liked<00:06:37.470> about<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:37.830> guy

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
same things that I liked about this guy

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.290 
same things that I liked about this guy
and<00:06:38.190> it<00:06:38.250> improves<00:06:38.610> on<00:06:38.759> some<00:06:38.970> of<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.090> things

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
and it improves on some of the things

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.700 
and it improves on some of the things
that<00:06:39.479> I<00:06:39.509> wasn't<00:06:39.900> so<00:06:39.990> crazy<00:06:40.169> about<00:06:40.380> with<00:06:40.620> the

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
that I wasn't so crazy about with the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.770 
that I wasn't so crazy about with the
first<00:06:40.919> one<00:06:41.130> in<00:06:41.220> terms<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.550> visuals<00:06:41.940> I<00:06:42.150> think<00:06:42.690> it

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
first one in terms of visuals I think it

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.090 
first one in terms of visuals I think it
just<00:06:42.900> looks<00:06:43.110> generally<00:06:43.530> better<00:06:43.710> with<00:06:43.949> that

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
just looks generally better with that

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100 
just looks generally better with that
color<00:06:44.340> up<00:06:44.520> there<00:06:44.699> for<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:44.970> face<00:06:45.150> mask<00:06:45.449> and<00:06:45.720> you
