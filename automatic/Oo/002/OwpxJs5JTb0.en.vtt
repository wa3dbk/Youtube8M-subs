alright say that the two cars are in I'm

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.050 
alright say that the two cars are in I'm
in<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.449> shed<00:00:03.629> now<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.140> plan<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.650> drill

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
in the shed now and the plan is to drill

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.629 
in the shed now and the plan is to drill
two<00:00:06.060> holes<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.230> side<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.710> side<00:00:08.280> panel

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
two holes in the side of the side panel

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.520 
two holes in the side of the side panel
with<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> hole<00:00:09.750> saw<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.530> put<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:12.530> 120mm

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
with a hole saw so I can put two 120mm

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.700 
with a hole saw so I can put two 120mm
fans<00:00:13.920> one<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.639> about<00:00:14.910> there<00:00:15.710> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
fans one there and one about there to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830 
fans one there and one about there to
get<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.250> airflow<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> cards<00:00:18.180> cause<00:00:18.359> it's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
get some airflow on the cards cause it's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720 
get some airflow on the cards cause it's
a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.050> hotter<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> there<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.430> I've<00:00:20.580> done

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
a lot hotter in there now as I've done

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.609 
a lot hotter in there now as I've done
some<00:00:20.910> measuring<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.600> side<00:00:22.050> panel<00:00:22.410> I've

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
some measuring on the side panel I've

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.029 
some measuring on the side panel I've
gone<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:25.109> fans<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.619> much<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
gone the fans are pretty much going to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.320 
gone the fans are pretty much going to
be<00:00:26.099> centered<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.180> because

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
be centered on this one here because

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.580 
be centered on this one here because
I've<00:00:27.539> measured<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> that's<00:00:28.289> where<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I've measured it up and that's where the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.269 
I've measured it up and that's where the
center<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.789> two<00:00:30.599> video<00:00:30.990> card<00:00:31.289> sets<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
center of the two video card sets so the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.780 
center of the two video card sets so the
fans<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.790> much<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:34.790> sitting

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
fans are pretty much going to be sitting

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.500 
fans are pretty much going to be sitting
on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> center<00:00:36.770> like<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.640> there

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
on the center like that one there there

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.549 
on the center like that one there there
this<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:41.600> was<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> 70<00:00:43.050> mm<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this one here is was a 70 mm from that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.810 
this one here is was a 70 mm from that
because<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:43.860> measured<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> that's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
because I've measured that up and that's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
because I've measured that up and that's
the<00:00:45.629> distance<00:00:45.780> before<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.410> fan<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the distance before the fan is going to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.510 
the distance before the fan is going to
pump<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:48.210> 70<00:00:48.510> mil<00:00:48.629> well

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
pump into that that's 70 mil well

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.350 
pump into that that's 70 mil well
otherwise<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> won't<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.789> able<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> call<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
otherwise you won't be able to call to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.110 
otherwise you won't be able to call to
close<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> case<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.219> 45<00:00:53.699> mil<00:00:53.969> because

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
close the case now that's 45 mil because

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
close the case now that's 45 mil because
don't<00:00:54.449> remember<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.989> almost<00:00:55.949> cut<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> holes

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
don't remember I almost cut the holes

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.660 
don't remember I almost cut the holes
incorrectly

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
incorrectly

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
incorrectly
this<00:00:59.670> case<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:02.270> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this case to go on that has to do it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
this case to go on that has to do it
clips<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.979> slides<00:01:05.339> in

clips on and then and then slides in
locking<00:01:06.570> lugs<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> remember<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
locking lugs so you have to remember to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.120 
locking lugs so you have to remember to
leave<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> gap<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.210> otherwise<00:01:12.860> your<00:01:13.860> fan

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
leave that gap there otherwise your fan

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.950 
leave that gap there otherwise your fan
will<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.520> flush<00:01:14.820> mounted<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> edge<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
will be flush mounted with the edge and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
will be flush mounted with the edge and
you<00:01:16.110> won't<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> able<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> clip

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you won't be able to put it on and clip

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.170 
you won't be able to put it on and clip
it<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.170> understand<00:01:20.180> which

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it in if you if you understand which

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
it in if you if you understand which
means<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.630> fan<00:01:21.960> needs<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> gap<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> inside

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
means your fan needs a gap on the inside

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.179 
means your fan needs a gap on the inside
to<00:01:23.580> allow<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.650> sideways<00:01:25.650> movement<00:01:26.040> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to allow for that sideways movement for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240 
to allow for that sideways movement for
them<00:01:27.229> okay<00:01:28.229> here's<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> side<00:01:28.680> panel<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
them okay here's the side panel with the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.910 
them okay here's the side panel with the
holes<00:01:29.579> drilled<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.380> 120mm<00:01:31.380> fans<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
holes drilled for the two 120mm fans and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.660 
holes drilled for the two 120mm fans and
we<00:01:32.009> used<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> call<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> graphics<00:01:33.060> cards<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.670> did

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
we used to call the graphics cards I did

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.950 
we used to call the graphics cards I did
it<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> same<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.720> this

tutorial thanks to those guys from put
in<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.840> me<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> use<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
in there that up for me I have to use a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
in there that up for me I have to use a
larger<00:01:43.460> hole<00:01:44.460> saw

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
larger hole saw

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.660 
larger hole saw
it's<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.229> 127<00:01:46.229> Milhouse<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> mean<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's a 127 Milhouse or so I mean the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.030 
it's a 127 Milhouse or so I mean the
fans<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> hang<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.720> bit

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
fans are going to hang a little bit

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.139 
fans are going to hang a little bit
outside<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> bit<00:01:50.430> too<00:01:50.549> large<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
outside it's a bit too large but is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.960 
outside it's a bit too large but is
either<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.619> spend<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.250> hundred

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
either that or spend about a hundred

it's<00:03:59.780> got<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> pretty<00:04:00.229> crappy<00:04:00.560> if<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.829> did<00:04:01.040> that

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
it's got a pretty crappy if I did that

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.050 
it's got a pretty crappy if I did that
because<00:04:01.879> he<00:04:02.120> didn't<00:04:02.269> say<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.479> hole<00:04:02.919> is<00:04:04.060> bigger

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
because he didn't say the hole is bigger

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.219 
because he didn't say the hole is bigger
than<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.799> big<00:04:06.799> filter<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.430> mount<00:04:07.970> itself<00:04:08.359> so

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
than the big filter and mount itself so

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.689 
than the big filter and mount itself so
what<00:04:09.379> I've<00:04:09.470> done<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.829> I've<00:04:10.009> decided<00:04:10.189> to<00:04:10.519> keep

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
what I've done is I've decided to keep

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.530 
what I've done is I've decided to keep
the<00:04:11.919> kick<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.099> wire<00:04:13.549> grill<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.239> I'll<00:04:14.419> just

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
the kick the wire grill and I'll just

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.999 
the kick the wire grill and I'll just
put<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.900> filters<00:04:15.319> on<00:04:15.409> the<00:04:15.500> back<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.799> shoot

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
put the filters on the back so shoot

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.529 
put the filters on the back so shoot
stop<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.609> later<00:04:19.789> dust<00:04:20.029> coming<00:04:20.269> through

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
stop a later dust coming through

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.520 
stop a later dust coming through
but<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.650> still<00:04:21.859> doesn't<00:04:22.039> look<00:04:22.159> that<00:04:22.250> bad

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
but it still doesn't look that bad

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.080 
but it still doesn't look that bad
from<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.650> outside<00:04:24.980> just<00:04:25.460> put<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.580> bit<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.730> black

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
from the outside just put a bit of black

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.760 
from the outside just put a bit of black
tape<00:04:26.330> behind<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.930> bit<00:04:27.110> just<00:04:27.320> there<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.680> you

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
tape behind that bit just there so you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.770 
tape behind that bit just there so you
can't<00:04:27.980> see<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.220> gaps<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.330> keep<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.600> dust

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
can't see the gaps and you keep the dust

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.030 
can't see the gaps and you keep the dust
out<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.430> think<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.700> should<00:04:31.820> be<00:04:31.850> good
