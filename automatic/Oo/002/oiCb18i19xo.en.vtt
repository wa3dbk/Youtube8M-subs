00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and and tire one at a time go on but

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
and and tire one at a time go on but
I've<00:00:49.739> dealt<00:00:50.160> develop<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I've dealt develop something where I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
I've dealt develop something where I
kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.230> combine<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> jhop<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> Buddy<00:00:53.850> hot

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
kind of combine a jhop it and Buddy hot

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.959 
kind of combine a jhop it and Buddy hot
but<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.960> bunny<00:00:55.530> hop<00:00:55.800> because<00:00:55.969> you're

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
but it's more bunny hop because you're

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.700 
but it's more bunny hop because you're
not<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.360> pedaling<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.980> front<00:00:59.660> so

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
not really pedaling to get your front so

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.420 
not really pedaling to get your front so
um<00:01:02.270> yeah<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.539> I'll<00:01:04.019> show<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.189> i'll

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
um yeah so I'll show you one and i'll

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.990 
um yeah so I'll show you one and i'll
show<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:13.760> was<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
show you how to do it I was kind of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
show you how to do it I was kind of
crappy<00:01:15.210> cuz<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:15.900> garage<00:01:16.580> imitating<00:01:20.960> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
crappy cuz on my garage imitating so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.350 
crappy cuz on my garage imitating so
that's<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.830> talking<00:01:23.220> about

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that's kind of what I'm talking about

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
that's kind of what I'm talking about
it'd<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.540> easier<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> show<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.110> outside<00:01:25.350> but

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it'd be easier to show you outside but

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.609 
it'd be easier to show you outside but
my<00:01:25.830> camera<00:01:26.220> doesn't<00:01:26.340> work<00:01:26.580> outside<00:01:27.380> go<00:01:28.380> sleep

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
my camera doesn't work outside go sleep

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.280 
my camera doesn't work outside go sleep
right<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:30.020> anyway<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
right but anyway how do you do this is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.240 
right but anyway how do you do this is
basically<00:01:35.960> instead<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.229> pulling<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
basically instead of pulling up like you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.630 
basically instead of pulling up like you
see<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:38.880> videos<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.640> we

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
see all the other videos just at that we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.020 
see all the other videos just at that we
want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.689> pull<00:01:43.310> straight<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.610> like

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
want to do is pull straight back like

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.870 
want to do is pull straight back like
put<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.020> butt<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.649> over<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.490> seat

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
put your butt over you over your seat

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.039 
put your butt over you over your seat
and<00:01:48.259> what<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.439> does<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.740> brings<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
and what that does this brings it up a

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.399 
and what that does this brings it up a
bad<00:01:52.049> foot<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:53.220> less<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.200> do

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bad foot maybe less and then what you do

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
bad foot maybe less and then what you do
is<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.130> basically<00:01:56.310> string<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.149> your<00:01:57.329> body

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
is you basically string out your body

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.600 
is you basically string out your body
and<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.649> brings<00:01:59.299> what<00:02:00.299> happens<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and that brings what happens there is

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.270 
and that brings what happens there is
you<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> naturally<00:02:03.890> bring<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:05.040> bars

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you kind of naturally bring your bars

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.760 
you kind of naturally bring your bars
closer<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.119> body<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.560> brings

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
closer to your body and so that brings

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.880 
closer to your body and so that brings
the<00:02:10.950> tire<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.400> before

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
the tire up before

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.850 
the tire up before
other<00:02:12.450> from<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.319> scoop<00:02:14.680> your

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
other from there you just scoop your

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.740 
other from there you just scoop your
feet<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.709> right<00:02:17.920> away<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.390> i'll<00:02:19.390> show

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
feet up and you right away so i'll show
