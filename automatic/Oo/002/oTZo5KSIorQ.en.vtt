00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.790
 Well I'd have is Baba-kun in Saitama 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.780
 I 'm not so dexterous enough to go behind people 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.730
 We'll do live beds Temple Station and businesslike burns is bad 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.160
 It looks like it's the first and last Young, so it's local 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.470
 It is a feeling that it does not take after all 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.300
 It is all his power 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.840
 I have not come out 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 It has been a big success since I went to s class 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.150
 It is can Well quite surprising surprisingly Do total of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.150
 So I'm a little surprised by myself How do you buy it for ? 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.070
 That's right I would like to race positively 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.070
 It seems that you want to enter it first 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.399
 What year was this year 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.550
 here well for yourself 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.820
 I think it was finished well 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.680
 How about a fight in sq 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.490
 If you do so, everyone is strong so I struggled a little 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.079
 I was worried about that tree a little but how about that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 The source for the first time of cultivation also Well injuries but it was a little Well worry because it was落車 is 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:28.409
 It was all right now because it was light 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 Because everyone really strong Nde impatient to do so that you do not come to help force from yourself go place 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 I will do my best 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.000
 Last year was known National Team Kappa 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.350
 One-shot race What about 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.540
 I agree 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.130
 I'm pretty nervous 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.700
 It will be Young Grand Prix last chance in the 97th period, but yes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.120
 I want to race without regrets 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.780
 How do you run 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.780
 Well that's right 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.220
 I think that you wonder if go from the side and go Nde impatient 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.080
 I saw the members and decided to go to Harada 's box 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.950
 It says I No. 2 store competition 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.990
 That's right I always do it myself 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:12.560
 There is no problem because I'm doing it in the training before, so I regret it at the beginning and the end 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.840
 There is no way we would I want firmly Dashikiri forces 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.710
 It is the third single 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.780
 Well, I think I will always have a chance, so I will do my best not to miss that chance 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.400
 What kind of race do you want 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.660
 Well yes one 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.319
 I think that it only makes sense, so I would like to work actively aiming for the first one 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.740
 But it Yes is a four Grand Prix of one person from Hyakki 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.930
 After all, even 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'm seeing pottery sponsorship 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.760
 I would like to carry my 100 keys firmly and do my best 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.790
 What kind of race do you want 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.989
 I think that I want to stand around in the short term as a result of thinking 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.620
 I 'm not the type that tame the leg in large gear, so firmly 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.460
 I hope to actively play a game before 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:04.030
 It is only one person continuous 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:08.709
 Well co-star is but it was a public bath in the horse I am behind that requires only do there are Takeuchi Mr. 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.080
 Second place in the fairly empty phlegm from the previous cabinet cooler Why in the practice of the previous 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.730
 On highways and banks 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.860
 Because I finished it 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.350
 Good feeling yes 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.050
 Yes it is a victory 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.160
 I came to do something 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.160
 I only think about it
