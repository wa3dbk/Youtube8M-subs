00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.199
 Now let's look at the moon and countries to the atmosphere and soil 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.369
 we seek the moon and tricks her with the space bar 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.980
 Sobik he looked up very close 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 it is the second one shortly after nine months the church is narrow after 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.210
 he seems to swing heavily by the e-card Oriana mount 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.040
 that's why the India Team and Allah Mount change 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.040
 with the time-lapse the moon becomes more and more shape 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 Red the STA 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.120
 the confessed the perspective 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 here played on the moon 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.790
 as Mondragon a in the US under Obama still around the earth 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 in the wake of the moon we are illuminated by the sun 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.110
 we see the earth from their night going on in fast motion around the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.760
 earth 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.000
 the impression and once the world all come out to see 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.729
 After Easter, our moon is now back in sunshine 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.870
 new moon 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.720
 back to earth 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 because our mosque location we could see the earth all the time 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.130
 that proves 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.060
 the Morris is bound and rotated 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.180
 your DomRep on its own axis and the circulation around the earth under loud 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.300
 parallel in time 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.460
 therefore we always see the same second moon from Earth 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.389
 the opportunity to a rarely occurring KÃ¶lliker lunar eclipse 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.829
 We were watched on the 5th think 2011 in Marburg 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.209
 We enter the time and date and search for the moon 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.959
 there he is 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 he has an unusual reddish brown color 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.299
 to observe that happens in the following hour, we summarize the 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.689
 Time 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.939
 as we can see, the earth-shadow wanders over the moon 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.649
 this one is now illuminated again by the sunlight on the left edge 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.269
 he is the old one again
