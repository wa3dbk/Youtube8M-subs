batani
before<00:00:23.660> before<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.810> left<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.670> that's<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.299 

the<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.879> knife<00:00:54.059> batons<00:00:55.430> excellently<00:00:56.449> I<00:00:58.309> don't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the the knife batons excellently I don't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
the the knife batons excellently I don't
know<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.489> type<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> wood<00:00:59.909> this<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.300> because

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
know what type of wood this is because

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
know what type of wood this is because
I'm<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.289> even<00:01:01.559> naturally<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.339> Poland<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.920> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'm not even naturally from Poland so I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
I'm not even naturally from Poland so I
won't<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> clue<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.210> my<00:01:09.210> best

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
won't have a clue but it really my best

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.320 
won't have a clue but it really my best
guess<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:13.070> softer<00:01:14.070> side

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
guess it's it's more on the softer side

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.940 
guess it's it's more on the softer side
of<00:01:15.330> wood<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.789> soft<00:01:18.119> wood<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.750> not

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
of wood so it is a soft wood so it's not

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.570 
of wood so it is a soft wood so it's not
it's<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:21.659> harder<00:01:22.320> wood<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.430> back

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's not a harder wood when I get back

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.529 
it's not a harder wood when I get back
to<00:01:23.759> Chicago

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
to Chicago

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.609 
to Chicago
I'll<00:01:24.869> definitely<00:01:27.020> baton<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.259> harder

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I'll definitely baton through harder

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
I'll definitely baton through harder
stuff<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.069> see<00:01:29.869> how<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.080> knife<00:01:31.350> goes<00:01:32.990> through

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
stuff to see how this knife goes through

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
because that the keeps on slipping see

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:59.170

it<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:45.720> goes<00:01:45.959> through<00:01:46.350> beautifully

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:25.120
