 Hello, it had not been for a while 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.060
 no dessert and nothing today I decide for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.080
 this delicious profiterole cake 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.240
 coffee that is super easy you will see and that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.800
 is very good for this Christmas 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 Well, I hope you like it. Let's go 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 first we will do is place a bucket 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 cream until it boils while 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.460
 so much we are taking the nine leaves of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.260
 gelatin and we are going to soak them 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 in water good now since the cream we 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.370
 has boiled then let's take the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.370
 sugar 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610
 gelatin 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.210
 and the two spoonfuls of nescafÃ© 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.640
 Now we put it back to the fire 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.360
 stirring without stopping until you return to 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 go into boiling 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.049
 slowly without hurry as you already 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 let's go stirring, let's see how 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.460
 they are mixing well all the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.520
 ingredients and this is what we want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 get before it starts to boil 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.090
 no previously wet mold 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.759
 put the profiteroles filled with cream 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.759
 and now let's throw the previous mix 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.660
 slowly and very carefully not 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.660
 burn us 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.039
 ready you see how easy it is now I'm going 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.560
 to leave the fridge all night and tomorrow 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.159
 unmold it is to say we will give you the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.140
 turn it sprinkles everything over 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.450
 with cocoa powder or failing 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.490
 you can also use cao tail with the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.560
 life of a colander and we can also 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.659
 put over some decoration with 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.850
 sugar icing I'm going to leave you now a couple 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.729
 of photos so you can make an idea I hope 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.170

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.890
