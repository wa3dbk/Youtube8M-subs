play deathmatch service freefall what
you<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.329> start<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.899> with

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you want to do is to start off with

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
you want to do is to start off with
forgetting<00:00:47.010> everything<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> then

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
forgetting everything you know and then

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520 
forgetting everything you know and then
going<00:00:49.110> ahead<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.620> practicing<00:00:50.489> spray<00:00:50.789> control

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
going ahead and practicing spray control

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.029 
going ahead and practicing spray control
so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.699> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> learn<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
so the first thing you want to learn is

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.330 
so the first thing you want to learn is
to<00:00:56.300> control<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.360> gun<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.160> your

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to control your gun to know what your

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
to control your gun to know what your
gun<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.180> certain<00:01:00.600> situations<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
gun does in certain situations and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
gun does in certain situations and
therefore<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> an<00:01:02.910> offline

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
therefore you just go on to an offline

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.740 
therefore you just go on to an offline
server<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.129> yourself<00:01:05.280> without<00:01:06.270> bots

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
server that you do yourself without bots

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.420 
server that you do yourself without bots
and<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.680> shoot<00:01:07.920> walls<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> shoot<00:01:09.750> stuff

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
and you just shoot walls you shoot stuff

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.289 
and you just shoot walls you shoot stuff
you<00:01:11.430> shoot<00:01:11.700> certain<00:01:12.270> items<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> shoot

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
you shoot certain items you shoot

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.390 
you shoot certain items you shoot
through<00:01:15.299> walls<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.110> learn<00:01:16.320> wall<00:01:16.590> banging<00:01:16.890> all

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
through walls you learn wall banging all

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
through walls you learn wall banging all
that<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> stuff<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> done<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.110> offline

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that kind of stuff is done in an offline

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.450 
that kind of stuff is done in an offline
match<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.580> stage<00:01:21.240> number<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:22.460> there's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
match this is stage number one there's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.719

target<00:01:29.640> practice<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.380> recorded<00:01:31.740> any<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
target practice I have recorded any of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
target practice I have recorded any of
the<00:01:32.909> footage<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the footage because I think it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
the footage because I think it's
self-explanatory<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.630> ahead<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
self-explanatory so just go ahead and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
self-explanatory so just go ahead and
download<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:38.960> train<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.710> profoundly

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
download that to train more profoundly
