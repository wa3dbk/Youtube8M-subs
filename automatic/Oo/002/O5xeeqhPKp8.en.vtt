00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
at the moment because there have to be

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.600 
at the moment because there have to be
two<00:01:02.269> away<00:01:02.780> from<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.289> enchantment<00:01:04.190> table<00:01:04.220> on

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
two away from the enchantment table on

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.800 
two away from the enchantment table on
the<00:01:04.670> same<00:01:05.449> level<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.500> above<00:01:07.660> giving<00:01:08.660> you

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the same level and one above giving you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.280 
the same level and one above giving you
32<00:01:09.250> now<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:11.300> drag<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.690> drop<00:01:11.810> whatever<00:01:12.170> you're

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
32 now you drag and drop whatever you're

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.960 
32 now you drag and drop whatever you're
training<00:01:12.680> into<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:15.310> these<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.730> want<00:01:16.910> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
training into here and these you want to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.310 
training into here and these you want to
aim<00:01:17.090> for<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.390> highest<00:01:17.540> number<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.900> can<00:01:18.020> find

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
aim for the highest number you can find

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.960 
aim for the highest number you can find
now<00:01:19.220> these<00:01:19.490> number<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.910> numbers<00:01:20.360> just<00:01:20.630> improve

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
now these number of numbers just improve

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.400 
now these number of numbers just improve
represent<00:01:22.970> an<00:01:23.090> improved<00:01:23.480> chance<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.200> better

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
represent an improved chance of a better

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.100 
represent an improved chance of a better
ancient<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.670> basically<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.480> had<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.840> number

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
ancient so basically if had the number

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.780 
ancient so basically if had the number
the<00:01:27.440> better<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:29.120> they<00:01:29.300> also<00:01:30.550> represent<00:01:31.550> how

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
the better and they also represent how

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.280 
the better and they also represent how
many<00:01:32.180> levels<00:01:32.450> are<00:01:32.600> going<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:32.870> taken<00:01:33.110> off<00:01:33.260> of

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
many levels are going to be taken off of

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.770 
many levels are going to be taken off of
you<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.130> down<00:01:34.460> here<00:01:34.730> usually<00:01:35.030> however<00:01:35.480> you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you so down here usually however you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.590 
you so down here usually however you
have<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.260> number<00:01:36.440> in<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.250> mill<00:01:37.370> here<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.600> that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
have a number in the mill here and that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.510 
have a number in the mill here and that
is<00:01:38.720> basically<00:01:38.870> your<00:01:39.350> currency<00:01:39.680> for<00:01:40.130> enchants

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
is basically your currency for enchants

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.880 
is basically your currency for enchants
so<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:41.240> I'd<00:01:41.360> level<00:01:41.630> 50<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.140> could<00:01:42.440> access<00:01:42.830> a

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
so if I'd level 50 I could access a

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.850 
so if I'd level 50 I could access a
little<00:01:43.190> 50-inch<00:01:43.730> at<00:01:43.910> fat<00:01:44.750> level<00:01:44.990> 43<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:45.590> can

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
little 50-inch at fat level 43 I can

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.320 
little 50-inch at fat level 43 I can
access<00:01:46.310> level<00:01:46.550> 43<00:01:46.760> in<00:01:47.150> chance<00:01:47.360> or<00:01:47.690> lower<00:01:49.330> and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
access level 43 in chance or lower and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.030 
access level 43 in chance or lower and
that<00:01:50.480> is<00:01:50.690> basically<00:01:50.900> all<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:51.710> know

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
that is basically all that you know

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.800 
that is basically all that you know
about<00:01:52.130> enchanting<00:01:52.909> there<00:01:53.240> will<00:01:53.390> be<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.570> map
