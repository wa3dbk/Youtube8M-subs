 cycle he will not review it 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.510
 but now I will tell everything in brief 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.090
 what we saw in this trailer 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.100
 you've probably seen a lot of things and you donâ€™t 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.710
 I understand what you saw in this trailer 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:58.100
 in general, then, as they say , 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.770
 daredevil told us his dream then 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 that in childhood his father was killed in hell 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.410
 the kitchen and since childhood he wanted to be a hero 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.500
 to save your neighborhood from evil which 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.750
 it fills the mafia and so on there you 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.610
 We saw the man who was wearing glasses is 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.060
 will be his coach who will be his 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.130
 train and learn to navigate 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.100
 still because our hero is blind 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.010
 Matt Murdoch and he should be all the same 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.110
 like that to hear the hero therefore he 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.140
 will train him to hear and also 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.300
 fighting skills home people still this 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.990
 huge dude this is an ambal you could have him 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.800
 see in the series 94 kind of year 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 spiderman 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.390
 he appeared there too he will be in 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.490
 first season daredevils chief 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.710
 a villain but he will not die further 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.490
 will appear maybe even been 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.620
 dry to catch pike 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.930
 spiderman is the name to pronounce it 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.550
 I can not rumor it is shorter 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.350
 will be called the new part of what 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.890
 just a spiderman they are unlikely to be 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.419
 call a specular 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:11.810
 may be called in general there was 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:14.500
 kingpin fisk ambal is not a villain at all 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.390
 spiderman but it's a daredevil villain 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.660
 there we saw a very good martial arts 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.800
 explosions good moments were good 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.760
 cool that resemble something 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.260
 big budget movie but there it is not 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.300
 will be due to the budget movie were 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.640
 moments if there is a good cut 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.970
 for example with the first avenger and insert 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.010
 these scenes can not even distinguish well well 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.770
 here is the last scene where i neigh 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.780
 shorter dude says why man 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.960
 maybe he has an iron suit 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.230
 or 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.470
 magic hammer so why is he you 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.690
 can kill shorter hint that well 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.930
 lean on the iron man and the torus 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.700
 type iron suit and this hammer torus 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.740
 that is, this action will occur 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.290
 just a daredevil before the avengers will 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.910
 elk occur not before the avengers and after 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.740
 immediately after the avengers are not 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.840
 now which is currently going 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.790
 now we have an era of hydra where now 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.620

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.780
 Well, there we will still observe the era 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.900

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.550
