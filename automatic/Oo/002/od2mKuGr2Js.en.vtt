 not go down 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.110
 we do not care that's it's that's the 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.770
 marketing principle to make it last 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.840
 pleasure 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.000
 so you're going to have a lot of events 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.640
 wrong anyway it's not bad with everything 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.920
 the catches how to create the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.530
 modernity 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.520
 look at this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.520

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.319
 florian community manager must not have 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.019
 30 years 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.709
 now that even ebadi going down the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.900
 target do all the attributes of that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.590
 renault would like to seduce and in potential 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.599
 even breaking 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 so I would like a brief decoding of the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.290
 evening a fortune big game in the process of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.239
 seconds and then from the car the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.579
 capture the evening these plates 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.880
 it fits perfectly with the image that 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.490
 gave the car 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.020
 with the drive in recent locate it's 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.370
 just it's really fair it's 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.200
 original 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.540
 after for the car 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.800
 promising outside yeah 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 singing and dancing 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.660
 currently 7 passes and differentiating 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 compared to the vote marks a little disappointed 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.710
 it's a toy for the outside we have 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.400
 the impression of a toy and the interior 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.400
 it's a toy a little 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.189
 the real is nice is what we 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.480
 waiting to be annoyed by these practices 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.150
 we'll be right in front of me I roll in 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.159
 clio nor to the three cases already a little more 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.359
 Zen and the solution is much better there 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.300
 and it's a lot nicer 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.180
 to touch 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.769
 I am a little disappointed 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.349
 there is finally hand over 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.700
 inside of don carlo if you 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.980
 plays remits of the cash in the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.980
 initiators did that but otherwise nothing
