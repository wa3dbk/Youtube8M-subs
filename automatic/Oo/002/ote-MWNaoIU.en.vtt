00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.550 
use nicely laid out but it just looks
and<00:04:30.550> feels<00:04:30.880> slightly<00:04:31.450> old-fashioned<00:04:32.320> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
and feels slightly old-fashioned and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.930 
and feels slightly old-fashioned and
there's<00:04:32.950> some<00:04:33.070> other<00:04:33.250> nasty<00:04:33.760> feeling

think<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.700> real<00:04:36.970> shame<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
think it's a real shame that the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.270 
think it's a real shame that the
Volkswagen<00:04:38.170> Group<00:04:38.290> wants<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.830> keep<00:04:38.980> such<00:04:39.250> a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
Volkswagen Group wants to keep such a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
big separation between their brands

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.990 
big separation between their brands
because<00:04:41.950> this<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.250> doesn't<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.730> same

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
because this just doesn't have the same

because this just doesn't have the same
at<00:04:43.150> market<00:04:43.480> feel<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.080> get<00:04:44.350> from<00:04:44.590> a

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
at market feel that you get from a

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.640 
at market feel that you get from a
Volkswagen<00:04:45.370> Polo<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:46.660> know<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.900> feels<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
Volkswagen Polo you know it feels and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.920 
Volkswagen Polo you know it feels and
looks<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.310> interior<00:04:48.730> from<00:04:49.390> a<00:04:49.480> budget

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
looks like the interior from a budget

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.010 
looks like the interior from a budget
brand<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:50.590> Skoda<00:04:51.400> isn't<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.360> budget<00:04:52.600> brand

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
brand and Skoda isn't a budget brand

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.770 
brand and Skoda isn't a budget brand
anymore<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.850> that's<00:04:54.850> another<00:04:55.330> point<00:04:55.660> to

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
anymore and that's another point to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.140 
anymore and that's another point to
consider<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:56.770> might<00:04:56.950> get<00:04:57.160> plenty<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.670> extras

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
consider you might get plenty of extras

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600 
consider you might get plenty of extras
as<00:04:58.240> standard<00:04:58.720> but<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.290> new<00:04:59.470> Fabia<00:04:59.830> costs<00:05:00.370> more

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
as standard but the new Fabia costs more

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.150 
as standard but the new Fabia costs more
and<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:01.420> isn't<00:05:01.570> quite<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.170> budget<00:05:02.530> buy<00:05:02.740> once

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
and it isn't quite the budget buy once

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.910 
and it isn't quite the budget buy once
was<00:05:03.490> but<00:05:04.210> overall<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.810> think<00:05:05.170> our<00:05:05.350> verdict<00:05:05.770> on
