hi my name is Brian and today I'm going

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.610 
hi my name is Brian and today I'm going
to<00:00:09.300> show<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.450> another<00:00:09.780> alternate<00:00:10.410> picking

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
to show you another alternate picking

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.799 
to show you another alternate picking
exercise<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.760> in<00:00:12.420> case<00:00:12.540> you're<00:00:12.690> wondering

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
exercise and in case you're wondering

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.780 
exercise and in case you're wondering
yes<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:13.530> appreciate<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.190> irony<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.580> me

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
yes I do appreciate the irony of me

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.030 
yes I do appreciate the irony of me
sitting<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.509> acoustic<00:00:15.980> front<00:00:16.980> of

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
sitting here with my acoustic front of

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.519 
sitting here with my acoustic front of
these<00:00:17.099> badass<00:00:17.640> tube<00:00:18.000> amps<00:00:18.450> but<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.349> know<00:00:19.410> when

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
these badass tube amps but you know when

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
these badass tube amps but you know when
it<00:00:19.619> comes<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.860> building<00:00:20.009> pic<00:00:20.340> technique<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it comes to building pic technique I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.730 
it comes to building pic technique I
think<00:00:21.660> there's<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:21.960> better<00:00:21.990> approach<00:00:22.470> than

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
think there's no better approach than

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
think there's no better approach than
just<00:00:22.890> playing<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.490> acoustic<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.779> you

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
just playing on your acoustic but if you

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.210 
just playing on your acoustic but if you
don't<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.080> an<00:00:25.140> acoustic<00:00:25.320> Noir<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.010> just

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
don't have an acoustic Noir you just

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
don't have an acoustic Noir you just
grab<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:26.640> electric<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> recommend<00:00:28.170> playing

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
grab your electric and recommend playing

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.170 
grab your electric and recommend playing
on<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> clean<00:00:28.830> channel<00:00:29.100> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.939> know<00:00:30.029> if

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
on a clean channel if you know if

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.810 
on a clean channel if you know if
possible<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.529> most<00:00:31.949> often<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> picnic<00:00:32.669> sir

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
possible so most often a picnic sir

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.310 
possible so most often a picnic sir
sizes<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.239> based<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> premise<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.019> trying

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sizes are based on the premise of trying

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.220 
sizes are based on the premise of trying
to<00:00:34.379> maximize<00:00:34.680> speed<00:00:35.430> by<00:00:36.059> minimizing<00:00:36.840> motion

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to maximize speed by minimizing motion

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.469 
to maximize speed by minimizing motion
because<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> motion<00:00:38.519> of<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.390> know

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:39.479 
because it's the motion of you know

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.479 
because it's the motion of you know
jumping<00:00:39.870> around<00:00:39.960> changing<00:00:40.680> strings<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
jumping around changing strings that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
jumping around changing strings that
attempts<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.150> get<00:00:42.330> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.449> way<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> speed<00:00:43.049> but

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
attempts to get in the way of speed but

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
attempts to get in the way of speed but
today<00:00:44.339> I'm<00:00:44.909> gonna<00:00:45.030> show<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.210> something<00:00:45.449> quite

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
today I'm gonna show you something quite

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.240 
today I'm gonna show you something quite
a<00:00:45.839> bit<00:00:45.989> different<00:00:46.379> today<00:00:46.650> it's<00:00:46.799> not<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.100> about

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a bit different today it's not all about

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
a bit different today it's not all about
speed<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:48.150> today<00:00:48.720> I'm<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:48.900> show<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.049> how

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
speed and today I'm gonna show you how

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.390 
speed and today I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:49.199> alternate<00:00:49.589> pick<00:00:49.739> across<00:00:49.979> multiple

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
to alternate pick across multiple

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.130 
to alternate pick across multiple
strings<00:00:50.879> where<00:00:51.299> each<00:00:51.479> string<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
strings where each string just has a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
strings where each string just has a
single<00:00:52.500> note<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.519> you<00:00:53.610> might<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.820> wondering

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
single note and you might be wondering

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670 
single note and you might be wondering
well<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.869> wouldn't<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> normally<00:00:55.619> use

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
well you know wouldn't you normally use

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.070 
well you know wouldn't you normally use
the<00:00:55.860> sweet<00:00:56.129> picking<00:00:56.400> technique<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.089> and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
the sweet picking technique for that and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.189 
the sweet picking technique for that and
my<00:00:58.199> answer<00:00:58.470> would<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.619> yes<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.150> know<00:01:00.269> if

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
my answer would be yes but you know if

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.359 
my answer would be yes but you know if
you<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.619> try<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.339> little

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
you want to try something a little

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.280 
you want to try something a little
different<00:01:02.519> than<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.629> exercise<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
different than this exercise is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.469 
different than this exercise is
definitely<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.390> know

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
definitely for you and so you know

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
definitely for you and so you know
normally<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> were<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.350> play<00:01:07.560> say<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> D

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
normally if you were to play say a D

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.010 
normally if you were to play say a D
major<00:01:08.610> pressure<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.360> would<00:01:09.450> use<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> sweet

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
major pressure you would use the sweet

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.010 
major pressure you would use the sweet
Pikmin<00:01:10.320> technique<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.900> also

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Pikmin technique but you can also

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
Pikmin technique but you can also
alternate<00:01:13.500> pick<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.890> types<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> riffs

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
alternate pick those types of riffs

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
alternate pick those types of riffs
which<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.630> normally<00:01:15.900> wouldn't<00:01:16.050> think<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> do

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
which you normally wouldn't think to do

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
which you normally wouldn't think to do
but<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> gives<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> different

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but it gives you kind of a different

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
but it gives you kind of a different
sound<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.590> know<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.800> guitar<00:01:20.070> plays<00:01:20.310> we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
sound and you know as guitar plays we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
sound and you know as guitar plays we
should<00:01:20.670> always<00:01:20.790> appreciate<00:01:21.330> anything<00:01:21.630> that's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
should always appreciate anything that's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.210 
should always appreciate anything that's
different<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> sets<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.190> apart

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
different you know that sets you apart

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
different you know that sets you apart
so<00:01:24.150> consider<00:01:24.510> this<00:01:24.600> nice<00:01:24.810> sounding<00:01:25.290> minor

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
so consider this nice sounding minor

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
so consider this nice sounding minor
chord<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.050> you<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.650> appreciate<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
chord you know you would appreciate that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
chord you know you would appreciate that
you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.730> we've<00:01:29.880> consecutive<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.810> up

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you know we've consecutive down and up

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.910 
you know we've consecutive down and up
strokes

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.320 

but<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.010> can<00:01:36.100> also<00:01:36.220> often<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.640> pick<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.000> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
but you can also often to pick that and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.510 
but you can also often to pick that and
that<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:38.530> know<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:38.680> particular<00:01:39.100> lends<00:01:39.280> itself

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
that you know in particular lends itself

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.050 
that you know in particular lends itself
to<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.760> triplet<00:01:40.150> feel<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.340> what<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.670> do<00:01:45.790> is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
to a triplet feel and so what I do is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.580 
to a triplet feel and so what I do is
I'll<00:01:46.150> get<00:01:46.330> my<00:01:46.390> metronome<00:01:46.869> set<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> fairly

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
I'll get my metronome set on a fairly

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.160 
I'll get my metronome set on a fairly
slow<00:01:47.830> tempo<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.150> just<00:01:49.540> gradually<00:01:49.810> build<00:01:50.050> up

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
slow tempo and just gradually build up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.560 
slow tempo and just gradually build up
speed<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.580> also<00:01:51.700> notice<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.240> tend<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
speed and you also notice that I tend to

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.870 
speed and you also notice that I tend to
arrest<00:01:52.930> my<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.770> know<00:01:53.890> finger<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.790> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
arrest my you know finger on the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.060 
arrest my you know finger on the
pickguard<00:01:55.390> while<00:01:56.200> I'm<00:01:56.290> picking<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.890> find

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
pickguard while I'm picking I just find

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.200 
pickguard while I'm picking I just find
it<00:01:57.160> gives<00:01:57.280> me<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.460> little<00:01:57.640> bit<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.820> added

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
it gives me a little bit of added

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.880 
it gives me a little bit of added
stability<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.170> can<00:01:59.290> also<00:01:59.410> rest<00:01:59.710> your

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
stability but you can also rest your

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.040 
stability but you can also rest your
palm<00:02:00.070> by<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.580> bridge<00:02:00.910> which<00:02:01.300> give<00:02:01.900> you<00:02:01.990> kind

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
palm by the bridge which give you kind

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
palm by the bridge which give you kind
of<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.229> cool<00:02:02.470> muffled<00:02:03.400> sound<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:08.080> let<00:02:08.770> me<00:02:08.860> show

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
of a cool muffled sound so let me show

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.330 
of a cool muffled sound so let me show
you<00:02:09.840> I'm<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:10.959> like<00:02:11.110> at<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.290> slow<00:02:11.500> tempo<00:02:11.800> at

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
you I'm just like at a slow tempo at

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:23.649 
you I'm just like at a slow tempo at
around<00:02:12.550> 85<00:02:13.000> beats<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.020> minute

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.940 

like<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.720> said<00:02:24.930> I'll<00:02:25.079> just<00:02:25.260> gradually<00:02:25.560> build

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
like I said I'll just gradually build

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.440 
like I said I'll just gradually build
that<00:02:26.069> up<00:02:26.129> until<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.879> no<00:02:26.939> longer<00:02:27.000> play<00:02:27.329> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that up until I can no longer play it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.600 
that up until I can no longer play it
cleanly<00:02:27.950> because<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.069> know<00:02:29.189> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.459> you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
cleanly because you know you know you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.309 
cleanly because you know you know you
never<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.000> sacrifice<00:02:30.480> speed<00:02:30.959> for

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
never want to sacrifice speed for

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.259 
never want to sacrifice speed for
sloppiness<00:02:31.890> cuz<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.579> know<00:02:32.670> who<00:02:32.790> likes<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.060> hero

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
sloppiness cuz you know who likes a hero

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.720 
sloppiness cuz you know who likes a hero
you<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.079> fast<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.680> sloppy<00:02:34.920> guitar<00:02:35.459> player

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you know a fast and sloppy guitar player

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.789 
you know a fast and sloppy guitar player
so<00:02:36.599> let<00:02:36.870> me<00:02:36.959> show<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.379> sounds<00:02:37.500> like

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
so let me show you what that sounds like

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.599 
so let me show you what that sounds like
around<00:02:38.540> 200<00:02:39.540> beats<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.750> minute<00:02:40.049> which<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.609> the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
around 200 beats a minute which is the

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.069 
around 200 beats a minute which is the
point<00:02:41.849> where<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> usually<00:02:42.390> find<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.989> no

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
point where I usually find that I can no

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:59.780 
point where I usually find that I can no
longer<00:02:43.260> play<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.620> cleanly<00:02:58.340> now<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.370> found<00:02:59.639> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
longer play it cleanly now I found the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.550 
longer play it cleanly now I found the
coolest<00:02:59.970> thing<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.629> technique<00:03:01.049> is

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
coolest thing about this technique is

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.199 
coolest thing about this technique is
especially<00:03:02.040> when<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.400> start<00:03:02.549> adding<00:03:02.790> open

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
especially when you start adding open

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.000 
especially when you start adding open
strings<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:03.989> play<00:03:04.139> some<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.530> cool

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
strings you can play some really cool

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.699 
strings you can play some really cool
sounding<00:03:05.579> chord<00:03:05.909> progressions<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:07.500> sound<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
sounding chord progressions it sound a

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.720 
sounding chord progressions it sound a
little<00:03:07.769> bit<00:03:07.980> different<00:03:08.310> than<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.639> would

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
little bit different than what you would

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.030 
little bit different than what you would
otherwise<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:09.299> from<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.739> using<00:03:10.920> your

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
otherwise get from you know using your

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.009 
otherwise get from you know using your
standard<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:12.150> know<00:03:12.269> consecutive<00:03:12.840> dong

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
standard you know consecutive dong

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.860 
standard you know consecutive dong
consecutive<00:03:13.799> upstroke<00:03:14.519> approach<00:03:14.939> you<00:03:15.750> know

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
consecutive upstroke approach you know

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.119 
consecutive upstroke approach you know
you<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.109> just<00:03:16.139> I<00:03:16.470> mean<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> possibilities

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
you can just I mean the possibilities

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:35.640 
you can just I mean the possibilities
are<00:03:17.519> really<00:03:17.609> endless

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.630 

anyway<00:03:36.650> hopefully<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.100> have<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.280> new

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
anyway hopefully you have a new

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.610 
anyway hopefully you have a new
appreciation<00:03:37.760> for<00:03:38.420> Alton<00:03:38.990> picking<00:03:39.380> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
appreciation for Alton picking and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.810 
appreciation for Alton picking and
hopefully<00:03:40.070> you'll<00:03:40.190> be<00:03:40.220> able<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.520> incorporate

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
hopefully you'll be able to incorporate

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.300 
hopefully you'll be able to incorporate
it<00:03:41.150> into<00:03:41.240> your<00:03:41.390> own<00:03:41.600> play<00:03:41.870> until<00:03:42.860> next<00:03:43.010> time

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
it into your own play until next time

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.790 
it into your own play until next time
