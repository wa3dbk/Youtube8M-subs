00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.690
 and a warm welcome to her 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.780
 love to another wow addon tip 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes, there really is 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 countless complete interfaces for wow 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.410
 you really already with one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 mouse click has installed but there is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.000
 but still the wow users the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 really use the standard in the face 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.250
 but also there may come from time to time 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 times the moments where you think so 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.250
 it is a pity that you do not do that a bit 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.320
 It can be a pity that I do not change that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960
 can move a little bit and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.440
 here comes this add-on for you here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 game 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 how it all looks exactly that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.270
 I will now once in the game 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.070
 I find myself so noble and noble 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 once in the game and if you add this 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.489
 and of course, have it installed now 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.110
 that happens quite normal as well as with 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 He needs to change everyone else 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 nothing to consider here now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.100
 about the game menu once this add-on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.379
 call and with her another one 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 button added there click now 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 once and then open up here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 for us another window on the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.769
 At first glance, that may be 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.710
 a bit much we have one here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
 huge list but you find yourself 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.100
 really really very fast in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.830
 This add-on is right and it is too 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 really very simple 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 I just open it befitting 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 here my guild window open that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.409
 also according to the standards always left of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 us and yes I would like that now 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.560
 this window always opens to the right 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.180
 and I'll show you how it works 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 whole here at all works 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.759
 however, the list was great in the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.720
 list here now the guild as us 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.430
 Of course you have to have one too 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 Know a little bit what we want to change 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.229
 our interface and i want it now 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.350
 as I said here, the yellow window 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.930
 move 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 So I go here on the guild and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.229
 click on it and you see 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.320
 eventually opens still 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.270
 different many yes subcategories 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.609
 I just do it now 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.140
 so that first is always the window so 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.880
 once the picture in the window and the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.979
 Move guilds fensterbau more also 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.170
 we have two small ones here now 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 boxes that we can also use and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 Although the serious thing is this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 I'll just postpone now 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.450
 a hook in and you will see then 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 It's all a little over a year 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.019
 maybe you can say "brewed" 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.610
 it just shows us what we do 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.099
 right here or what we move 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 just change here and we have yes 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.849
 get a little window to it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.739
 that it's easy for the accuracy of that 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.049
 just would be just fine if it was 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.480
 quite fussy want to have it on 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.340
 want to move to the centimeter 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280
 easy and i can do that now 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.140
 she said about this over this one 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.579
 button here I make here can also 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.650
 also put in the middle but I can 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.060
 I can really do it by hand 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.890
 Of course, that's what it is too 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.660
 possible and I just do it now 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.829
 times as I said her right behind saw 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.079
 I would like to have it 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.880
 Click here for the extra 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.920
 take over the window again 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
 to and then I show you then opens 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.970
 of course, the window is always 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.410
 right of us to our right and if 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.480
 of course not at some point 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.019
 then you can enjoy more 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.609
 always click on the back button and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.730
 then everything will be reset 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.880
 on the standard on the standard the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.950
 default settings like that and then is 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.810
 all this so again in order just 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 whatever we can do whatever 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.709
 a very nice thing is we 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.170
 can now also here on the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.730
 name itself click on it then opens 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.760
 for us, meaning one more 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.620
 window and there we have many more 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 many different different attitude 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.440
 Of course I will not be on everyone 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.239
 you can just enter 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.769
 also formulas themselves purely because 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.049
 as said this addon is really 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 very easy to handle we can there 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.380
 so much easier to change and do 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.239
 and do 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.950
 I'm just showing you this way 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.850
 times 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.590
 general what you just here on the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.450
 first look looks like me 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.800
 could now say if the window 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.870
 I do not like it that's too small for me 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 I just want that size there 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.920
 I have the opportunity here and now 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.810
 can this whole as you see it here 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.630
 zoom in entire windows zoom out 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.000
 just as I would like it to be 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.160
 I should say at night now 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.770
 that can be toned down a bit 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.750
 so its a bit more transparent 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.030
 its the whole window that is too 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.850
 possible as well as i can do it here too 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.410
 again on the axis back and forth 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.880
 shove when he says oh no that can 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.440
 It can be here below 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.660
 Be above it is also again 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.110
 possible you can do it again 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.090
 do 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.380
 as could pleasant windows here 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.330
 even many different ones 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.000
 I accept attitudes, for example 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.680
 Say the background of the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.570
 I do not like it there should negotiate 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.830
 should be transparent that's enough for me 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.240
 perfect I am here simply the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.880
 see medium then you can do that 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.130
 as well as the edge of the like 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.520
 Do not get the wall off with it 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.960
 also possible as well as highlights well 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.120
 you can not see them here but now 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.160
 example up here you like it too 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.080
 not the can away then this could 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.790
 So we also do it you see there 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.340
 really very many settings 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.090
 here's the simple way, yes 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.500
 can change from so can change exactly 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.000
 Of course , that's not all 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.330
 You should like that again 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.310
 wanting something else, or maybe somewhere 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.840
 should have made a mistake or something 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.520
 You can always do that again 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.800
 reset this is always natural 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.840
 possible just as beautiful is easy 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.250
 many also have the minimap here 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.530
 down in the middle maybe or 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.020
 maybe many of you would prefer downstairs 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.240
 right with it is also possible that 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.400
 means i want it the minimap endermann 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.720
 I go here once through the list 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.280
 by the way you have to, of course 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.120
 always a little bit to know what's up here 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.950
 want to change 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.169
 then of course click once in here 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.540
 the minimap in and i want it 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.490
 general mini map so yes change it 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.620
 is once the first marriage year 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.000
 once again in the first kettle her 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.430
 See, we get the little one here again 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.260
 window and we can also do this here 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.570
 mini with the much I can move 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.390
 Sit down or I can sit down 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.250
 also sit down or let those mediums 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.650
 must 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.390
 click here again on the exile 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.980
 I can do that here, too 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.600
 I want to bother that here now 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.810
 could i implement this after here 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.430
 sit down or yes wherever you are 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.840
 wanted to have the same way I can now yes 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.010
 for example the calendar he 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.900
 I could do that here, too 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.420
 now sit down here or at the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.860
 bring chatroom or other really 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.930
 leave everything to yourself 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.060
 just as we could now 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.040
 click here again on the 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.030
 the writings on the minimap itself and 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.800
 You can see here, for example 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.530
 if she is too small for me she is on now 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.990
 make it bigger that it is also possible that 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.610
 You could do it too, so you see 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.440
 is really very much possible with 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.330
 Just add this on 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.070
 to adjust a bit for yourself 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.080
 especially when you are such a big one 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.730
 fan of in the standard interface is but 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.340
 Sometimes there really are here and there 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.080
 few things you just go up to 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.669
 might want to change down too 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.290
 wants to increase snoozes 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.590
 and so on, but not so 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.960
 So it really starts right now 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.490
 completely want to access interface because 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.950
 Just use this standard interface 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.419
 So yes, as I said, I hope so 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.850
 could you so the tip again 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.680
 help a little bit further 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.110
 otherwise you will find more tips 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.630
 Of course on my channel I wish 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.919
 you again loose loose and fluffy
