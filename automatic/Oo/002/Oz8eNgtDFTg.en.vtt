00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.290
 small caramelized apples and a sauce 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.389
 salted butter caramel 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 ah yes a little laugh the ways recused 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.820
 recipe for your reer or you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 round rice also sugar and 600 g 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 I take a cinnamon stick you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 can take vanilla if he does not like 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 not cinnamon not a problem too 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 so half skimmed milk so a liter 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 then for caramelized apples 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 so two apples take for example 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 golden that are well sweetened with a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 little butter and a little bit of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.840
 brown sugar and finally for our sauce au 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 caramel and salted butter 125 g sugar 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.980
 125 g of liquid fresh cream per 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.829
 example or thick cream 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 and here I took 40 g of half- salted butter 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.770
 once the water is in the process of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.329
 boil game just add the rice so 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.329
 rinse them with lukewarm water 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.020
 here and there we will preclude 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.840
 does 1 3 minutes in this water 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 boiling 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 So here I was listening to my rice after 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 3 me and so you see he already has a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.700
 small white color 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 pre cooked so that's going to give it a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 booklet shown tender for rice pudding 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.720
 it is necessary that it is fondant 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.009
 especially not small grains that creaks 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.759
 this is what we are going to do so I have 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.200
 cut off the fire I'll turn it on again with 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.659
 so I'm going to add the sugar the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.999
 rod 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:48.380
 cinnamon and milk so a liter of 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:50.929
 semi skim milk here and that we will do 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.569
 cook so we'll already have it all to 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.380
 boiling 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.810
 once it will be hot in 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.369
 will go down the heat so on a low heat we go 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.509
 cook slowly for 20 to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.869
 25 minutes 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.869
 it will be necessary to check the cooking of v 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 so here I take care of the apples during 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.440
 that rice is cooking so 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 you peel bottom 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 you come to arrange the pieces of 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.840
 apples 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.050
 You mix well not to sprinkle 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.250
 with a little brown sugar 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.790
 the idea here is going to be to melt your 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 apples quietly over medium heat 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.590
 for a few minutes a dozen 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.760
 minutes you see your apples are in 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.560
 caramelizing so wanted 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.450
 mix well as you finally 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.350
 some hooks here we want some 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.420
 nice little pieces pop well 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.730
 that cantori arrived so I lowered the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.860
 fire index began to boil and there 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.750
 you stir from time to time you have to 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.100
 not forget it 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.140
 here are the grains are helping 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.300
 cyr and so we will prepare the sauce at 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.600
 caramel salted butter so you do 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.590
 simply melt the sugar over the heat 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.590
 sweet in a saucepan 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.340
 so here is the caramel is ready he has 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.110
 a beautiful amber color so I cut 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.930
 the fire what we do is we add 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.930
 the butter and mix the greuze mans 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.849
 with a whip like this 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.820
 here you see there you get a pretty 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.250
 salted butter caramel when you go 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.080
 add cream then the cream 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.670
 I left on 120 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.320
 milliliters you add then we go 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.940
 flatten the fire no no no you 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.590
 add cream to get the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.320
 consistency you want a you 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.230
 do not have to put everything 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.030
 and this must be vigorously mixed 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.620
 cream it will soften the caramel it's 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.600
 everything is after 25 30 minutes of 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.190
 cooking watch our rio the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.840
 perfect it's way better so you had 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.300
 do not hesitate to go up to 30 minutes 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.280
 cooking if the milk we talk about does not have 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.710
 totally thickened like that so there we 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.720
 will pour the caramel caramel sauce at 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.090
 salted butter at the bottom of the verrines you 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.270

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.880
 then we will put our rice pudding 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.740

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.979
 and finally we will come to have the little ones 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.979
 pieces of caramelized apples on 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.020
