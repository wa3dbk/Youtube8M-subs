stains on everybody and it's actually

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.390 
stains on everybody and it's actually
it's<00:03:32.470> probably<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.010> stay<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.250> back

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it's probably going to stay in the back

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920 
it's probably going to stay in the back
of<00:03:33.519> my<00:03:33.580> hand<00:03:33.790> honestly<00:03:34.180> when<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.330> wipe<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.720> off

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
of my hand honestly when I wipe this off

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.550 
of my hand honestly when I wipe this off
after<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:35.470> done<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:37.269> does<00:03:37.480> stay<00:03:37.690> on<00:03:37.720> fairly

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
after I'm done so it does stay on fairly

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.039 
after I'm done so it does stay on fairly
well<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.580> it's<00:03:40.150> also<00:03:40.209> kind<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.690> bitch<00:03:40.840> when

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
well but it's also kind of a bitch when

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.660 
well but it's also kind of a bitch when
you<00:03:41.140> want<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.350> take<00:03:41.500> off<00:03:41.650> your<00:03:41.799> makeup<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.459> you

you want to take off your makeup and you

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.430 
you want to take off your makeup and you
can't<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.209> color<00:03:43.450> off<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.959> your<00:03:44.110> lips<00:03:44.290> it

just still kind of stains so that's the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.360 
just still kind of stains so that's the
only<00:03:46.810> downside<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.380> one<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:47.980> put<00:03:48.280> up

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
and it actually looks really really

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.900 
and it actually looks really really
pretty<00:03:51.519> if<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:51.910> put<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.570> over<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.019> top<00:03:53.230> of
