00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
an electric-type and has a Taser and

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.509 
an electric-type and has a Taser and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
then you have the water type she just

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
then you have the water type she just
walks<00:01:06.149> around<00:01:06.389> with<00:01:06.719> a<00:01:06.780> bowl<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.109> water<00:01:07.499> to

earth and sick psychic sorry and another

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:16.969 
earth and sick psychic sorry and another
one<00:01:15.749> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.959> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.499> was<00:01:16.529> actually

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
one I think I think there was actually

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
one I think I think there was actually
one<00:01:17.009> who<00:01:17.279> had<00:01:17.429> to<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.509> yeah<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.990> very

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
one who had to but yeah that was very

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
one who had to but yeah that was very
funny<00:01:19.529> to<00:01:19.859> see<00:01:20.039> because<00:01:20.219> it<00:01:20.429> reminded<00:01:20.909> me<00:01:20.999> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
funny to see because it reminded me a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.629 
funny to see because it reminded me a
lot<00:01:21.270> about<00:01:21.420> Pokemon<00:01:22.109> so<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.649> was<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.100> oh<00:01:23.310> what

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
lot about Pokemon so I was like oh what

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.449 
lot about Pokemon so I was like oh what
time<00:01:23.850> should<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.899> were<00:01:25.109> in<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:26.069> club

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
time should I be if I were in that club

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.769 
time should I be if I were in that club
so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.149> would<00:01:27.329> probably<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:28.520> psychic

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:29.779 
so I think it would probably be psychic

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:32.179 
so I think it would probably be psychic
so<00:01:30.779> I<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:31.139> trying<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> attack<00:01:31.920> him<00:01:32.159> with

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so I they're trying to attack him with

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.269 
so I they're trying to attack him with
their<00:01:32.579> types<00:01:32.939> moves<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.539> all<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> stuff<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
their types moves and all that stuff so

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.219 
their types moves and all that stuff so
they<00:01:35.279> force<00:01:35.579> him<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.969> get<00:01:36.119> into<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> club<00:01:36.869> he

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
they force him to get into the club he

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.559 
they force him to get into the club he
doesn't<00:01:37.529> really<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.770> any<00:01:38.249> other<00:01:38.399> options<00:01:39.179> so

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
doesn't really have any other options so

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.899 
doesn't really have any other options so
after<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.380> his<00:01:40.770> whole<00:01:40.979> life<00:01:41.249> changes

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
after that his whole life changes

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.659 
after that his whole life changes
