00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hello dear friends glad everyone 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.849
 welcome romance with you today we 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.139
 We will look at the tablet from the company 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.150
 acer is called iconia b1 b1 one of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.720
 most budget devices from the company 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.760
 acer 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.730
 on the back of the box there 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.340
 specifications to those who 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:29.060
 sees well can directly read well, 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.530
 for those who do not want to bother you 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.510
 read here is used android 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.299
 the processor on the chipset it is from 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.949
 mediatek 1 2 GHz dual core 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:45.889
 analog 6577 in general familiar 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.209
 enough 512 megabytes of RAM 8 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:53.269
 build for 5 free gigabyte diagonal 7 

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:56.119
 inches matrix 3 usually test 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.929
 Sorry not play resolution 1024 on 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.319
 600 points 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.709
 there is a jeep there and dps there is bluetooth there 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.070
 Wi-Fi 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:10.670
 a slot for a memory card well, and that's perhaps 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.579
 everything on the battery said nothing 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.390
 text it will all be a battery something 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:20.990
 about 3000 milliamps well in my opinion 2 700 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.119
 2 710 even to be even more precise tablet 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 blue that is edging him 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.170
 blue expected it would be some more 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.079
 other colors but alas nothing 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.460
 No equipment is usually a network 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.990
 adapter connects to it melkon here 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.859
 user manual and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.749
 cable here at the top of the box too 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.789
 such a small instruction is inserted there 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.039
 just shows how to connect here 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.340
 perhaps the whole review will be enough 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.350
 short because practically nothing 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.119
 here telling many times we watched 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.630
 on this tablet, the more chipset 6517 0 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.929
 and 6577 dual core, in general, everything is all 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.689
 just but for now it will be included we 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.179
 we can look at the look of it 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.640
 us plastic so he is something 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 between plastic and glass prints 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 fingers remain dark in color 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.160
 there is a small rim here 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.030
 blue edging but it 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.810
 blue color such ultra bottom 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.980
 micro usb top front camera three 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.650
 a half millimeter 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.780
 for headphones and headsets and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.780
 so on I will do a little brighter now 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.500
 farther to the right but it's true 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 see how to keep volume control 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.530
 and microphone on / off button 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.600
 on the back here here is the speaker 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640
 is in spite of being like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 like black light fingerprints not 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.560
 very noticeable here on the back 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.560
 the side is just a hard light so well in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.670
 In general, something like this is even less visible 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.040
 there is no memory card under the cap 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.070
 and a slot under the memory card go here yet 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.220
 would fit a sim card but alas and here 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.950
 no 3g it does not support in general 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 pretty good collected but not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.900
 expect more cost of it 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.910
 devices about 5000 rubles analogs 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.459
 Of course full of fact sets 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.320
 the rhythm of life and so on is very 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.570
 briefly showed that there is that is 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.630
 horizontal orientation 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.630
 orientation 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.860
 that's probably the most convenient way 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.860
 use devices and so will 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
 show because it fits in the screen 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.100
 screen 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:46.290
 by the way the screen here is simple what 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.540
 said 1024 by 600 by 600 points falls 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.910
 contrast brightness and if so here 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.049
 do something we invert colors then 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.810
 there is a screen very very simple system 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.760
 not very inhibited about everything 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.340
 it works smoothly as I remember 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.180
 android 4 1 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.810
 installed and so on android 4 1 2 someone 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.260
 I can remember the version myself 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.780
 I go out as a whole to tell not what I am 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.140
 for example put dead space without problems 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.780
 going 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.080
 multitouch 5 touch gps works though 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.900
 of course so straining relative to 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.440
 quadrant what we can see 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.680
 the system 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.650
 This is our arm v7 processor 1 and 2 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.610
 gigahertz is the two cores mt 65 17 mt 65 17 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.400
 this is analog 6577 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.700
 512 RAM is not enough of course free 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.220
 About 200 graphics 531 but it is natural 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.270
 Well, here only accelerometer which 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.010
 is only responsible for turning the picture 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.010
 browser, well, let's run the browser 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.740
 x5 I booted well in general 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.260
 works fine can watch 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.960
 page at least not very 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.790
 severely inhibits more or less normal 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:15.660
 working exit market naturally there 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.880
 antutu how many points you can score 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.730
 look in the text if there is no text yet 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.630
 Well, it means that it was not launched yet. 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:29.370
 front side make music standard 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:32.160
 video plays all video files and all 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.050
 permissions but with audio there are some 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.480
 problems that you have to rather 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.690
 just put and we with video player but 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.910
 then scroll through any movies already 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.210
 Well, thank God full hd is supported 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.680
 true and so on camera 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.570
 front luggage for skype for 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.940
 some video calls for something not 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.930
 I know for what else can be perhaps 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.320
 and everything about the device is relatively 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.960
 shustrenko budget some and the other 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.580
 parties here from a famous brand that is 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.010
 I concluded in writing and that is 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.110
 if you want more or less famous 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.180
 brand meaning to buy here and sire 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.380
 at least the coloring is so jolly 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.020
 blue little blue if you are at all 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.600
 anyway there brand is not brand well then 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.680
 buy any exit without problems 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.720
 or explay for example surfer 702 or there 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.810
 there are already some other versions so 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.490
 Now there are no problems with the tablets but still 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.460
 I will repeat once more and less 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.260
 branded apparatitke but one of the 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.300
 budget 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.300
 thank you all bye bye
