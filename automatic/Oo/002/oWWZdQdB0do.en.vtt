happens to them see these here these are
greasable<00:00:44.360> ones<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:45.739> they're<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:47.210> I'm

pretty<00:00:47.540> sure<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:47.960> just<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.290> drag<00:00:48.680> link

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
pretty sure it's just this drag link

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.689 
pretty sure it's just this drag link
that's<00:00:50.000> right<00:00:50.390> there<00:00:50.839> on<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.949> steering<00:00:52.280> motor

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
that's right there on the steering motor

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.290 
that's right there on the steering motor
and<00:00:54.100> yeah<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.129> think<00:00:55.309> that's<00:00:55.640> still<00:00:55.790> I<00:00:55.940> think

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
and yeah I think that's still I think

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.750 
and yeah I think that's still I think
that's<00:00:56.629> one<00:00:56.809> that's<00:00:57.019> making<00:00:57.170> all<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.559> noise

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760
