gears in the in the shutter gate that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
gears in the in the shutter gate that
weren't<00:01:27.330> working<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
weren't working right so now now it's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:39.560 
weren't working right so now now it's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
working all properly on the lens this is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
working all properly on the lens this is
a<00:01:40.220> f19<00:01:41.220> lens<00:01:42.409> 1<00:01:43.409> 9<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.979> 16<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
a f19 lens 1 9 to 16 and this is the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
a f19 lens 1 9 to 16 and this is the
zoom<00:01:47.640> portion<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.659> your<00:01:51.659> focus

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
zoom portion right here and your focus

zoom portion right here and your focus
on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> very<00:01:52.409> end<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.700> side<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on the very end now this side this is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
on the very end now this side this is
the<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.009> lined<00:01:56.280> knob<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.149> use<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.719> wind

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the the lined knob you use this to wind

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
the the lined knob you use this to wind
up<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> spring<00:01:59.070> inside<00:02:00.649> this<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.799> all

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
up the spring inside this is all

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.139 
up the spring inside this is all
mechanical<00:02:02.610> stored<00:02:03.329> mechanical<00:02:03.869> energy

guess<00:02:09.019> that<00:02:09.200> wound<00:02:09.379> up<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:09.769> we<00:02:09.890> go<00:02:10.220> shutter

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
guess that wound up there we go shutter

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
guess that wound up there we go shutter

8<00:02:18.920> frames<00:02:20.200> barely<00:02:21.200> hear<00:02:21.409> it<00:02:21.500> all<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.610> way<00:02:22.700> up

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
8 frames barely hear it all the way up

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.039

sounds<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.129> need<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> watch

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
sounds like it's really need to watch

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:43.530 
sounds like it's really need to watch
the<00:02:35.890> inner<00:02:36.890> workings<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:37.549> it's<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.790> fast

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.569 

very<00:02:44.540> quick<00:02:47.650> take<00:02:48.650> off<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.890> lens<00:02:49.040> cap<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.489> if

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
very quick take off the lens cap see if

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.890 
very quick take off the lens cap see if
we<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.760> take<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.910> look<00:02:50.090> through<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:52.900> lens

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
we can take a look through the lens

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.589 
we can take a look through the lens
looks<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:57.340> they're<00:02:58.340> there<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.239> see<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
looks like they're there you can see the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.880 
looks like they're there you can see the
light<00:02:59.780> meter<00:03:01.000> currently<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> needs<00:03:02.890> some

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
light meter currently it needs some

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.440 
light meter currently it needs some
batteries<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.549> that<00:03:04.579> little<00:03:04.760> needle<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.269> work

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
batteries for that little needle to work

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.140 
batteries for that little needle to work
but<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.959> should<00:03:06.260> like<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.700> when<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:07.970> working

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
but it should like it when it is working

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
but it should like it when it is working
that<00:03:08.450> little<00:03:08.720> needle<00:03:08.840> will<00:03:09.109> move<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
that little needle will move to the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.819 
that little needle will move to the
right<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.299> tell<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.450> if<00:03:11.840> your<00:03:12.079> lighting<00:03:12.709> is

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
all set properly you set your film speed

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.110 
all set properly you set your film speed
here<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.739> let's<00:03:18.919> say<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> got<00:03:19.489> one<00:03:19.910> hundred

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
here so let's say I got one hundred

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.839 
here so let's say I got one hundred
speed<00:03:20.389> film<00:03:20.419> and<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.680> want<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:21.950> shoot<00:03:22.130> at<00:03:22.340> 64

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
speed film and I want to shoot at 64

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.409 
speed film and I want to shoot at 64
frames<00:03:23.090> per<00:03:23.299> second<00:03:23.690> as<00:03:23.810> an<00:03:24.650> example<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:26.120> line

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
frames per second as an example you line

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:33.210 
frames per second as an example you line
up<00:03:26.680> 64<00:03:27.790> with<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.329> 100<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.739> lock<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.690> oops

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
up 64 with the 100 and you lock it oops

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.339 
up 64 with the 100 and you lock it oops
get<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:34.519> there<00:03:35.299> we<00:03:35.359> go<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:36.019> light<00:03:36.169> meter

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
get in there there we go the light meter

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.250 
get in there there we go the light meter
is<00:03:36.470> now<00:03:36.620> set<00:03:36.919> so<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.790> little<00:03:38.000> needle

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
is now set so that that little needle

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.409 
is now set so that that little needle
will<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.220> center<00:03:40.579> when<00:03:40.819> it's<00:03:40.970> exposed

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
will be in the center when it's exposed

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.349 
will be in the center when it's exposed
properly<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:43.819> battery<00:03:44.060> compartment

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
properly this is the battery compartment

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.680 
properly this is the battery compartment
this<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.870> where<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.079> batteries<00:03:45.410> go<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:47.540> get

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
this is where the batteries go and get

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.439 
this is where the batteries go and get
unscrewed<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.639> think<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.699> takes<00:03:49.910> for<00:03:50.329> CR<00:03:51.260> 44<00:03:51.769> s

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
unscrewed I think it takes for CR 44 s

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.050 
unscrewed I think it takes for CR 44 s
but<00:03:53.449> I<00:03:53.510> might<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.690> wrong<00:03:53.780> about<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:55.060> because

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
but I might be wrong about that because

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.909 
but I might be wrong about that because
I<00:03:56.150> haven't<00:03:56.419> got<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.049> batteries<00:03:57.349> yet<00:03:59.769> see<00:04:00.769> it's

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
I haven't got the batteries yet see it's

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.030 
I haven't got the batteries yet see it's
