Linux<00:04:08.120> I'm<00:04:08.299> sure<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.689> does<00:04:08.870> though<00:04:09.199> but<00:04:09.949> I

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:09.979 
Linux I'm sure it does though but I

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.569 
Linux I'm sure it does though but I
can't<00:04:10.280> guarantee<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.329> um<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:13.069> does<00:04:13.280> come

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
can't guarantee that it um it does come

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.909 
can't guarantee that it um it does come

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
so I haven't really used that at all I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.459 
so I haven't really used that at all I
don't<00:04:21.859> think<00:04:22.099> I<00:04:22.669> might<00:04:23.419> install<00:04:24.020> at<00:04:24.229> some

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:24.469 
don't think I might install at some

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.459 
don't think I might install at some
point<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:26.030> parallel<00:04:26.479> system<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:27.169> just

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:27.469 
point on the parallel system I have just

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.499 
point on the parallel system I have just
to<00:04:27.620> compare<00:04:28.039> it<00:04:28.189> to<00:04:28.340> other<00:04:28.490> software<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> use

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
to compare it to other software I use

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.040 
to compare it to other software I use
but<00:04:30.169> there's<00:04:30.409> many<00:04:31.009> other<00:04:31.810> software's

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
but there's many other software's

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.070 
but there's many other software's

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
different plastic out body if you're

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.329 
different plastic out body if you're
looking<00:05:54.319> for<00:05:54.529> a<00:05:54.560> drive

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
looking for a drive

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.709 
looking for a drive
I<00:05:55.370> mean<00:05:55.759> off<00:05:55.879> the<00:05:55.909> top<00:05:56.149> of<00:05:56.180> my<00:05:56.389> head<00:05:56.539> I'd<00:05:56.689> say

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
I mean off the top of my head I'd say

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.689 
I mean off the top of my head I'd say
they're<00:05:57.259> probably<00:05:57.289> about<00:05:57.649> 50<00:05:58.099> bucks<00:05:58.310> they're

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
they're probably about 50 bucks they're

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.939 
they're probably about 50 bucks they're
probably<00:05:58.729> a<00:05:59.089> bit<00:05:59.270> less<00:05:59.569> I<00:05:59.930> know<00:06:00.020> when<00:06:00.529> I<00:06:00.560> first

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
probably a bit less I know when I first

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.760 
probably a bit less I know when I first
purchased<00:06:01.339> my<00:06:01.699> first<00:06:01.729> lg<00:06:02.360> drive<00:06:02.629> it<00:06:02.810> was<00:06:02.990> about

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
purchased my first lg drive it was about

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.320 
purchased my first lg drive it was about
50<00:06:04.189> bucks<00:06:04.370> but<00:06:04.610> I'm<00:06:04.699> sure<00:06:04.879> they've<00:06:05.060> gone<00:06:05.270> down

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
50 bucks but I'm sure they've gone down

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.209 
50 bucks but I'm sure they've gone down
in<00:06:05.750> price<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:06.469> fifty<00:06:06.949> US<00:06:07.219> dollars<00:06:07.779> at<00:06:08.779> the<00:06:09.139> most

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
in price so fifty US dollars at the most

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.189 
in price so fifty US dollars at the most
probably<00:06:10.219> I<00:06:10.460> wouldn't<00:06:11.149> spend<00:06:11.449> more<00:06:11.689> than<00:06:11.990> that

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
probably I wouldn't spend more than that

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.749 
probably I wouldn't spend more than that
unless<00:06:12.649> it's<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.949> really<00:06:13.279> good<00:06:13.490> one<00:06:13.729> that

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
unless it's a really good one that

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.719 
unless it's a really good one that
