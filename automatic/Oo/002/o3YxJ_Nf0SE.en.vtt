00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

I<00:00:00.120> mentioned<00:00:00.750> before<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:01.230> configuration<00:00:02.040> of

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
I mentioned before the configuration of

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.730 
I mentioned before the configuration of
the<00:00:02.340> mics<00:00:02.669> at<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> top<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.689> unit<00:00:03.959> are<00:00:04.110> set

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
the mics at the top of the unit are set

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.760 
the mics at the top of the unit are set
there<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> specific<00:00:06.150> purpose<00:00:06.420> if<00:00:07.020> you're

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
there for a specific purpose if you're

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.799 
there for a specific purpose if you're
recording<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.340> stereo<00:00:08.790> sound<00:00:09.150> maybe<00:00:09.510> coming

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
recording a stereo sound maybe coming

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.350 
recording a stereo sound maybe coming
from<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> right<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.650> example<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.429> these<00:00:11.940> mics

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
from the right for example if these mics

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.810 
from the right for example if these mics
were<00:00:12.630> set<00:00:12.900> up<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.500> outer<00:00:13.799> edges<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
were set up at the outer edges of the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.019 
were set up at the outer edges of the
unit<00:00:15.780> then<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> sound<00:00:16.830> coming<00:00:17.550> from<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
unit then the sound coming from this

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.359 
unit then the sound coming from this
source<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.660> would<00:00:19.080> arrive<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
source here would arrive at this

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.960 
source here would arrive at this
microphone<00:00:21.000> slightly<00:00:21.900> ahead<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:23.220> then

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
microphone slightly ahead in time then

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
microphone slightly ahead in time then
it<00:00:24.359> arriving<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> left<00:00:26.250> hand<00:00:26.460> mic<00:00:26.760> here

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it arriving on the left hand mic here

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.290 
it arriving on the left hand mic here
and<00:00:27.359> what's<00:00:27.960> more<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> waveform<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:30.090> at

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and what's more the waveform would be at

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.830 
and what's more the waveform would be at
a<00:00:30.359> different<00:00:31.189> slope<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.579> its<00:00:32.820> curve<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a different slope of its curve as it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
a different slope of its curve as it
arrives<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.829> mic<00:00:35.160> versus<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.000> mic<00:00:36.860> this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
arrives on this mic versus this mic this

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.100 
arrives on this mic versus this mic this
is<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> nasty<00:00:39.000> problem<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> audio

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is really a nasty problem that audio

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
is really a nasty problem that audio
engineers<00:00:40.590> battle<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.250> recording<00:00:41.790> studios

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
engineers battle in recording studios

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.520 
engineers battle in recording studios
when<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.550> multiple<00:00:44.629> microphones<00:00:45.629> if

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
when they use multiple microphones if

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.100 
when they use multiple microphones if
the<00:00:46.829> same<00:00:47.190> sound<00:00:47.700> arrives<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:48.960> different

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the same sound arrives at two different

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.250 
the same sound arrives at two different
mics<00:00:49.559> slightly<00:00:50.399> later<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.719> other<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
mics slightly later than the other and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.369 
mics slightly later than the other and
what's<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> waveform<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> crest

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
what's more that waveform is at a crest

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.950 
what's more that waveform is at a crest
on<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.100> mic<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> trough<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> other<00:00:57.780> one

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
on one mic and a trough on the other one

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
on one mic and a trough on the other one
when<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> hits<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> other<00:00:58.559> mic<00:00:58.770> that's<00:00:59.010> really

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
when it hits the other mic that's really

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
when it hits the other mic that's really
not<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.270> good<00:01:00.840> thing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
not a good thing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
not a good thing
take<00:01:01.739> us<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:01.980> example<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> ever<00:01:02.670> been

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
take us for example have you ever been

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
take us for example have you ever been
at<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> beach<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> wave<00:01:03.870> coming<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
at the beach when a wave coming into the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
at the beach when a wave coming into the
shore<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.760> crashed<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> wave<00:01:06.659> coming

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
shore has crashed into a wave coming

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.800 
shore has crashed into a wave coming
back<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.670> collide<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
back out now if they collide a lot of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.560 
back out now if they collide a lot of
the<00:01:09.900> energy<00:01:10.369> gets<00:01:11.369> lost<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.299> thing

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the energy gets lost the same thing

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.499 
the energy gets lost the same thing
happens<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.170> audio<00:01:14.100> waves<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> same

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
happens with audio waves if the same

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
happens with audio waves if the same
sound<00:01:16.020> gets<00:01:16.290> recorded<00:01:16.770> by<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:17.189> different

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
sound gets recorded by two different

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.899 
sound gets recorded by two different
mics<00:01:17.759> slightly<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> sync<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.650> phase<00:01:20.009> then

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
mics slightly out of sync or phase then

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.240 
mics slightly out of sync or phase then
you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.720> type<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> result<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> kind

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you can get this type of result it kind

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
you can get this type of result it kind
of<00:01:23.310> sounds<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> hear<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of sounds like this do you hear how it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.800 
of sounds like this do you hear how it
sounds<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:26.159> starts<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> sound<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:27.119> hard<00:01:27.479> in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
sounds it starts to sound pretty hard in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
sounds it starts to sound pretty hard in
certain<00:01:28.200> frequencies<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.759> might

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
certain frequencies you actually might

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
certain frequencies you actually might
hear<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.299> effect<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.049> cheap<00:01:31.290> cable

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
hear this effect on some cheap cable

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
hear this effect on some cheap cable
shows<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> engineer<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.570> not

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
shows where the engineer is really not

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.310 
shows where the engineer is really not
aware<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.470> problem<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.630> job<00:01:36.990> when

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
aware of this problem so your job when

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
aware of this problem so your job when
recording<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.890> h4n<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.270> sure<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
recording with h4n is to make sure that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.830 
recording with h4n is to make sure that
the<00:01:39.930> sounds<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.740> record<00:01:41.189> are<00:01:41.729> perfectly<00:01:42.720> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the sounds you record are perfectly in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.859 
the sounds you record are perfectly in
sync<00:01:42.960> between<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.860> left<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.869> channels

perfectly<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.890> phase<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.390> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
perfectly in phase that can you do that

and<00:02:00.469> get<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.549> where<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.850> meet

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and get this do you see where they meet

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.459 
and get this do you see where they meet
they<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.680> aligned<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.549> axis<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> each<00:02:06.780> mic

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
they are aligned so the axis of each mic

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.609 
they are aligned so the axis of each mic
meets<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> middle<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> all

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
meets right in the middle so that all

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.570 
meets right in the middle so that all
stereo<00:02:11.250> recordings<00:02:11.730> no<00:02:11.849> matter<00:02:12.030> where<00:02:12.239> like

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
stereo recordings no matter where like

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.750 
stereo recordings no matter where like
from<00:02:12.880> we'll<00:02:13.360> arrive<00:02:13.690> at<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.020> same<00:02:14.530> time<00:02:15.040> at

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
from we'll arrive at the same time at

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.200 
from we'll arrive at the same time at
each<00:02:16.150> mic<00:02:16.650> eliminating<00:02:17.650> phase<00:02:17.860> problems<00:02:18.340> with

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
each mic eliminating phase problems with

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.120 
each mic eliminating phase problems with
the<00:02:19.330> mics<00:02:19.630> meeting<00:02:20.170> right<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.710> middle<00:02:20.860> any

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the mics meeting right in the middle any

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.720 
the mics meeting right in the middle any
sound<00:02:21.550> will<00:02:21.790> arrive<00:02:22.120> simultaneously<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.980> each

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
sound will arrive simultaneously at each

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.190 
sound will arrive simultaneously at each
but<00:02:25.060> with<00:02:25.210> each<00:02:25.480> pointing<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.020> at<00:02:26.140> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
but with each pointing out at a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.400 
but with each pointing out at a
90-degree<00:02:26.830> angle<00:02:26.860> you'll<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> perfect

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
90-degree angle you'll get a perfect

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.000 
90-degree angle you'll get a perfect
stereo<00:02:29.410> image<00:02:29.770> with<00:02:30.130> no<00:02:30.610> phase<00:02:30.910> cancellation

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
stereo image with no phase cancellation

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
stereo image with no phase cancellation
actually<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.250> width<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.030> stereo

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
actually the width of the stereo

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660 
actually the width of the stereo
recording<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.920> adjustable<00:02:36.010> by

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
recording is actually adjustable by

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.050 
recording is actually adjustable by
tweaking<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.480> caps<00:02:38.280> screw<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> capsules<00:02:39.880> so

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
tweaking the caps screw the capsules so

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.870 
tweaking the caps screw the capsules so
they<00:02:40.180> both<00:02:40.420> say<00:02:40.920> 120<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:44.340> you'll<00:02:45.340> widen

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
they both say 120 here and you'll widen

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.540 
they both say 120 here and you'll widen
the<00:02:46.000> stereo<00:02:46.390> field<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.050> can<00:02:47.170> capture<00:02:47.550> 90

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
the stereo field that you can capture 90

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.720 
the stereo field that you can capture 90
degrees<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.480> right<00:02:49.840> angle<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.740> 120<00:02:51.459> degree

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
degrees is a right angle the 120 degree

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.820 
degrees is a right angle the 120 degree
setting<00:02:52.090> will<00:02:52.270> widen<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.810> stereo<00:02:53.230> image<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
setting will widen that stereo image and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.780 
setting will widen that stereo image and
extra<00:02:54.190> 30<00:02:54.430> degrees<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.680> picture<00:02:57.010> kind<00:02:57.700> of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
extra 30 degrees so just picture kind of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
extra 30 degrees so just picture kind of
the<00:02:57.910> width<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.450> performance<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.050> you're

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the width of the performance that you're

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.380 
the width of the performance that you're
trying<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> capture<00:02:59.830> if<00:03:00.160> 90<00:03:00.610> degrees<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.150> going

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
trying to capture if 90 degrees is going

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.960 
trying to capture if 90 degrees is going
to<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:01.870> too<00:03:02.110> narrow<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.680> force<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.400> recording

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
to be too narrow a force a recording

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.820 
to be too narrow a force a recording
maybe<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> choir<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.230> adjust<00:03:05.680> the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
maybe like a choir then adjust the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.090 
maybe like a choir then adjust the
capsules<00:03:06.340> accordingly<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.840> can<00:03:07.870> always<00:03:08.530> make

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
capsules accordingly you can always make

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.010 
capsules accordingly you can always make
some<00:03:09.400> test<00:03:09.670> recordings<00:03:10.150> or<00:03:10.390> maybe<00:03:10.600> listen

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
some test recordings or maybe listen

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.090 
some test recordings or maybe listen
live<00:03:11.320> through<00:03:11.680> some<00:03:11.860> headphones<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.850> check
