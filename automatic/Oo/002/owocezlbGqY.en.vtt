00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
going to do is just use my hands to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
going to do is just use my hands to
really<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.020> into<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> mixture<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.039> form<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
really get into the mixture and form a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.389 
really get into the mixture and form a

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
after I have the dough ready I'm going

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.210 
after I have the dough ready I'm going

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
to put it on a piece of parchment paper

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.520 
to put it on a piece of parchment paper
and<00:01:01.520> my<00:01:02.000> secret<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.720> use<00:01:02.780> some<00:01:03.020> chopsticks

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and my secret is to use some chopsticks

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.160 
and my secret is to use some chopsticks
to<00:01:03.800> get<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.100> perfect<00:01:04.489> thickness<00:01:04.900> so<00:01:05.900> I'm<00:01:06.050> just

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to get the perfect thickness so I'm just

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.170 
to get the perfect thickness so I'm just
going<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.440> roll<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:06.650> out<00:01:06.830> using<00:01:07.700> my<00:01:07.880> rolling

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
going to roll that out using my rolling

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.000 
going to roll that out using my rolling
pin<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.540> then<00:01:08.810> place<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:09.380> into<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
pin and then place this into the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.160 
pin and then place this into the
refrigerator<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:10.640> 30<00:01:11.060> minutes<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.570> harden<00:01:14.170> 30

refrigerator for 30 minutes to harden 30

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.900 
refrigerator for 30 minutes to harden 30
minutes<00:01:15.560> later<00:01:15.800> my<00:01:16.130> dough<00:01:16.190> is<00:01:16.310> all<00:01:16.580> chilled

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
and ready to be cut so I'm just going to

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
peel off the parchment paper and use

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.719 
peel off the parchment paper and use
some<00:01:21.259> cookie<00:01:21.560> cutters<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:22.100> cut<00:01:22.130> some<00:01:22.520> fun

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
some cookie cutters to cut some fun

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.770 
some cookie cutters to cut some fun
shapes<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.090> going<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.300> pop<00:01:26.479> these

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
shapes and I'm just going to pop these

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.969 
shapes and I'm just going to pop these
onto<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.320> Silpat<00:01:27.860> lined<00:01:28.310> baking<00:01:28.670> sheet<00:01:29.979> for

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
onto a Silpat lined baking sheet for

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.889 
onto a Silpat lined baking sheet for
some<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.430> cookies<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.090> cut<00:01:32.570> them<00:01:32.720> out<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
some of the cookies I cut them out and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.480 
some of the cookies I cut them out and
then<00:01:33.229> rolled<00:01:33.470> them<00:01:33.619> in<00:01:33.830> some<00:01:34.039> plain<00:01:34.250> white

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
then rolled them in some plain white

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.820 
then rolled them in some plain white
sugar<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.600> totally<00:01:35.990> optional<00:01:36.170> but<00:01:36.770> I

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
sugar this is totally optional but I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.150 
sugar this is totally optional but I
think<00:01:37.160> it<00:01:37.280> gives<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.640> cookies<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:37.970> nice<00:01:38.270> crunch

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
think it gives the cookies a nice crunch

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.680 
think it gives the cookies a nice crunch
so<00:01:40.160> continue<00:01:40.700> cutting<00:01:41.030> out<00:01:41.149> your<00:01:41.179> cookies

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
so continue cutting out your cookies

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.630 
so continue cutting out your cookies
until<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.200> have<00:01:42.320> an<00:01:42.470> entire<00:01:42.800> trays<00:01:43.160> worth<00:01:43.399> and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
until you have an entire trays worth and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.600 
until you have an entire trays worth and
then<00:01:44.090> put<00:01:44.330> them<00:01:44.509> into<00:01:44.690> your<00:01:44.929> oven<00:01:45.170> at<00:01:45.679> 350

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
then put them into your oven at 350

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.499 
then put them into your oven at 350
