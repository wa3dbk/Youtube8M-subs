so<00:01:13.069> my<00:01:13.810> workaround<00:01:14.810> for<00:01:14.959> that<00:01:15.109> is<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:16.340> give

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so my workaround for that is to give

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.870 
so my workaround for that is to give
yourself<00:01:16.819> a<00:01:17.450> shelf<00:01:18.079> or<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:19.069> kitchen<00:01:19.670> cabinet

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880

and a shelf in the refrigerator that's

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.330 
and a shelf in the refrigerator that's
only<00:01:23.149> for<00:01:23.479> your<00:01:23.630> food<00:01:23.869> now<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.649> serves<00:01:24.920> as<00:01:25.100> kind
