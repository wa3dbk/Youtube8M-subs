00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
market is up to what's possible or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.450 
market is up to what's possible or
mobile<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.590> still<00:01:01.800> only<00:01:01.920> 510

population<00:01:03.239> smartphones<00:01:03.989> overall<00:01:04.439> nearly<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
population smartphones overall nearly a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
population smartphones overall nearly a
quarter<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> population<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.659> think

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
quarter the population now so I think

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
quarter the population now so I think
we're<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> inflection<00:01:08.010> point

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we're that kind of inflection point

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
we're that kind of inflection point
where<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> lots<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> people<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.460> got

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
where you know a lots of people have got

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.380 
where you know a lots of people have got
smartphones<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
smartphones now so I think it's right to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
smartphones now so I think it's right to
kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
kind of think about them and what you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.499 
kind of think about them and what you
can<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> still<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
can do on them but you still need to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
can do on them but you still need to
remember<00:01:18.720> what's<00:01:19.530> possible<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.250> every

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
remember what's possible on an every

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
what's possible with every other device

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.289 
what's possible with every other device
we<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.930> talking<00:01:25.110> SMS<00:01:25.909> MMS<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.150> mean

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
as well yeah yeah absolutely I think I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.330 
as well yeah yeah absolutely I think I
mean<00:01:31.530> SMS<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.490> particular<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:34.189> probably<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
mean SMS in particular is probably the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
mean SMS in particular is probably the
one<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> most<00:01:35.820> underutilized<00:01:36.479> channels

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

one of the most underutilized channels
overall<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> scale

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
overall I think with you know the scale

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.499 
overall I think with you know the scale
that<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> results<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
