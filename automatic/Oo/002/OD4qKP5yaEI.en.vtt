00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 I have enough come but two remarks on the subject of training 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.140
 the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.330
 at the top is tinkering 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.869
 good player 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.869
 and there our big crisis superfruit 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.479
 That is a point the island is hilarious again 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 You can be a specialist at all

 Savings are being driven down there we just could not resist b 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.930
 an enrichment 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.899
 there is more to do, "he said 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.450
 the special

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 he exclaimed at the same time 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.129
 and civil proceedings look 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.110
 Which daily as far as possible 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.590
 Percent quoted People 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.970
 watch 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.020
 here is the period 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.670
 the earned wage 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.080
 Duke teardrop-shaped 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 I am eating it now 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 well then 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.659
 the judge pointed out that it is not easy that normal - not with 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.710
 the later so 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.720
 Now she does not enjoy it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.410
 the taste of it as well as Sven Tomato might be one of the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.790
 top-3 drives »from approx 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.970
 this is the usual taste of a Martin Dorner Paproth yet 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.340
 Bitter substances out 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.800
 that I have something here 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.310
 the citigroup title is specific 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 As reported Shafik wants the Vienna 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.980
 that's really good 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.560
 percentage of greatest losses 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 So what did that mean to this article is the destination countries, though 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.700
 also 70 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.180
 Berlin 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.130
 for example, the eleventh has the turn of the b1 turn than was foreseen 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.209
 It will be three times as much I'm not important 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.099
 him one 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:09.989
 and 2 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.839

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.009
 watching 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.430
 So a very interesting task has been clarified 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.020
 I came to use 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.749
 I think how reacts 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.290
 imagine that you could reach this year in Salach 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.370
 he started the town hall as intentionally even possible 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.479
 that was the concern 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.369
 on the other hand, one person demands living as he said she is an educator 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:41.900
 remarkably good 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.379
 but further deductions are made as § 3a para 8 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.439
 is possible 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.290
 that they have the limited validity 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.919
 ultimately it does not say only limited 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.189
 I believe every fourth 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.189
 Good weather was locked up 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.849
 learn here 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.449
 The Light of the World 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.639
 17 she also asks 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.769
 thanks to the experience
