00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
notice that sometimes when you're

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.150 
notice that sometimes when you're
cutting<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.020> kind<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.350> hard<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.680> get<00:03:10.920> through

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
cutting it's kind of hard to get through

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.610 
cutting it's kind of hard to get through
like<00:03:11.880> there'll<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.600> certain<00:03:12.870> stops<00:03:13.320> it's

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
like there'll be certain stops it's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.320

getting the top of that comp which is
from<00:05:28.310> H&amp;M<00:05:28.550> but<00:05:29.150> everything<00:05:29.510> else<00:05:29.660> is<00:05:29.780> from<00:05:29.960> a

big<00:05:30.229> store<00:05:30.470> but<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.710> think<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.070> outfit<00:05:31.370> is

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520

big store but I think this outfit is
really<00:05:31.729> great<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.810> wear<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:33.860> beginning<00:05:34.130> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
really great to wear and beginning the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.380 
really great to wear and beginning the
spring<00:05:35.120> season<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:36.789> for<00:05:37.789> shoes<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.150> could<00:05:38.270> be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
spring season and for shoes it could be

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.880 
spring season and for shoes it could be
anything<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.900> can<00:05:38.990> be<00:05:39.140> boots<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.680> be

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
anything it can be boots to be

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.719 
anything it can be boots to be
gladiators

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
gladiators

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.090 
gladiators

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
I probably pair this with gladiators but

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.279 
I probably pair this with gladiators but
yeah

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289
