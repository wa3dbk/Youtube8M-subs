00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.710
 art dance school we greet you from 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.710
 Dominican republic thank you once again 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.529
 everyone to follow these capsules and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.600
 because they have told us about how well 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 has been applying these movements 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 basic of the fan stream however 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.990
 there are still questions about 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 the use of this I want to share them in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.450
 these moments about the importance of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 use natural things to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.340
 represent the spiritual as per 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 example the cup the bread the candlestick 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.040
 can represent jesus christ or the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 cross can represent his sacrifice like this 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.809
 same the uses of the different 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.960
 Dance instruments will facilitate 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.719
 that manifestation of god visible to his 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.390
 people wearing a cloak represents their 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.030
 coverage the use of a fan of how 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.110
 it manifests the holy spirit the use 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.430
 of the spiritual war tape 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.090
 manifests when we use it as 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.460
 you throw all these 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.119
 representations we use them to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 facilitate the manifestation of the human eye 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.220
 of god for his people likewise the use 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the colors maybe in our bible 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.409
 does not say that brown means the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 earth but in the things of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.600
 nature we see it so the earth is 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 brown and when using this color we are 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 managing the productivity of the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 earth or the green that is the color of 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.380
 trees minister as creation as 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.030
 nature loves our god that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 is what I want to share so that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 you can understand the use of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.390
 elements of dance for a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.240
 natural application of the supernatural 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.009
 so let's start with this this 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.770
 fan stream very well today I'm going to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.619
 use a white color fan 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.200
 this distracts me the peace of God that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.530
 surpasses all understanding holiness 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.540
 the purity and also the holy spirit of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.569
 god that moves through the whistle 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.239

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.549
