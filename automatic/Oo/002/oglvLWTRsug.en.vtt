00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
other hand is an entirely different

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.780

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.910 
story but that's a whole other episode
anyway<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:44.480> people<00:00:44.900> in<00:00:44.989> india<00:00:45.260> are<00:00:45.350> too<00:00:45.800> much

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
anyway so people in india are too much

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.470 
anyway so people in india are too much
and<00:00:46.160> making<00:00:46.460> too<00:00:46.580> many<00:00:46.670> babies<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:47.330> the

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
and making too many babies and the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.119 
and making too many babies and the
solution<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.199> get<00:00:48.290> electricity<00:00:48.620> into

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
solution is to get electricity into

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.439 
solution is to get electricity into
smaller<00:00:49.430> indian<00:00:49.760> villages<00:00:50.089> which<00:00:50.330> are

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
smaller indian villages which are

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.240 
smaller indian villages which are
currently<00:00:50.780> without<00:00:50.930> power<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.129> can

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
currently without power so that they can

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.220 
currently without power so that they can
run<00:00:52.370> TVs<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.940> have<00:00:53.089> something<00:00:53.449> else<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.870> do<00:00:54.080> at

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
run TVs and have something else to do at

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.079 
run TVs and have something else to do at
night<00:00:54.379> before<00:00:54.559> they<00:00:54.800> go<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:54.920> sleep<00:00:55.040> it's<00:00:55.909> not

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
night before they go to sleep it's not

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:56.920 
night before they go to sleep it's not
just<00:00:56.150> that<00:00:56.360> there<00:00:56.570> are<00:00:56.629> too<00:00:56.750> many<00:00:56.809> people

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
just that there are too many people

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.990 
just that there are too many people
though<00:00:57.320> overpopulation<00:00:58.190> tax<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.699> already

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
though overpopulation tax is already

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700 
though overpopulation tax is already
limited<00:00:59.300> water<00:00:59.449> supplies<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.170> people<00:01:00.409> use<00:01:00.559> up

our best interest in these villages get

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.370 
our best interest in these villages get
reruns<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.670> law<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.000> order<00:01:08.060> pronto<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:09.140> mean
