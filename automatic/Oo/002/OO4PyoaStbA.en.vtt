it for the course and so for the
introduction<00:01:09.170> let's<00:01:10.170> start<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> cord

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
introduction let's start with the cord

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
introduction let's start with the cord
that<00:01:11.369> G<00:01:11.640> made<00:01:11.880> G<00:01:12.390> minor<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:13.409> GG<00:01:14.280> left<00:01:14.909> hand

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that G made G minor with GG left hand

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
that G made G minor with GG left hand
right<00:01:15.450> hand<00:01:15.509> D<00:01:16.350> b-flat<00:01:18.080> we<00:01:19.080> press<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.979> core<00:01:20.250> on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
right hand D b-flat we press the core on

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:42.870 
right hand D b-flat we press the core on
the<00:01:20.580> left<00:01:20.820> hand<00:01:21.409> right<00:01:22.409> hand<00:01:22.909> b-flat<00:01:23.909> D

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.660 

so<00:01:43.880> our<00:01:44.119> first<00:01:44.360> car<00:01:44.689> as<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:45.979> said<00:01:46.159> is<00:01:46.310> G

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
so our first car as we just said is G

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.889 
so our first car as we just said is G
minor<00:01:46.970> with<00:01:47.390> B<00:01:48.079> flat<00:01:48.320> D<00:01:48.560> 2<00:01:48.829> 1<00:01:49.159> 0<00:01:49.729> 1<00:01:49.939> 2<00:01:50.000> 3<00:01:50.330> 4<00:01:50.659> and

then second chord we're doing the same

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
then second chord we're doing the same
thing<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.330> right<00:01:53.420> hand<00:01:53.479> left<00:01:53.840> hand<00:01:54.049> B<00:01:54.289> flat

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
than the introduction so we repeat the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.920 
than the introduction so we repeat the
same<00:03:03.709> thing<00:03:04.130> one<00:03:05.030> more<00:03:05.060> time<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.450> let<00:03:05.810> me

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
same thing one more time just let me

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.729 
same thing one more time just let me
mention<00:03:06.140> something<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> left<00:03:08.270> hand<00:03:08.480> is

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
mention something on the left hand is

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.550 
mention something on the left hand is
best<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:10.400> best<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:11.030> emphasize<00:03:11.600> more<00:03:11.870> intimate

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
best is best to emphasize more intimate

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.620 
best is best to emphasize more intimate
key<00:03:12.770> we<00:03:13.400> play<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.770> right<00:03:15.980> side<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.630> for

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
key we play on the right side so for

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.070 
key we play on the right side so for
example<00:03:18.050> this<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:18.170> B<00:03:18.470> flat<00:03:18.620> D<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.630> let's<00:03:20.630> play

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
example this is B flat D so let's play

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.790 
example this is B flat D so let's play
quite<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> little<00:03:22.340> bit<00:03:22.630> louder<00:03:23.630> than<00:03:24.140> Hindi<00:03:24.530> for

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
quite a little bit louder than Hindi for

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.280 
quite a little bit louder than Hindi for
example<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.860> more<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:29.050> its<00:03:30.160> second

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
example this is more like its second

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:58.620 
example this is more like its second
voice<00:03:33.290> maybe

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.660 

see<00:03:59.680> also<00:04:00.680> here<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:04.430> we'll<00:04:04.550> keep

then we are diesel so FA DFAT and then

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.930 

this<00:05:59.350> is<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.590> part<00:05:59.830> after<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.250> first<00:06:00.640> and

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
this is the part after the first and

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.430 
this is the part after the first and
something<00:06:01.570> else<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.870> would<00:06:01.990> like<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.260> mention

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
something else I would like to mention

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.830 
something else I would like to mention
is<00:06:03.180> for<00:06:04.180> example<00:06:04.330> we<00:06:05.020> start<00:06:05.320> with<00:06:05.470> D<00:06:05.710> minor

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.440 

always<00:06:11.840> sometimes<00:06:12.680> before<00:06:12.860> we<00:06:13.190> press<00:06:13.520> the

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
always sometimes before we press the

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.980 
always sometimes before we press the
base<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:16.520> other<00:06:16.550> key<00:06:17.060> on<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.330> left<00:06:17.510> hand

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
base and the other key on the left hand

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.120 
base and the other key on the left hand
I<00:06:18.580> think<00:06:19.580> another<00:06:20.300> key<00:06:20.660> is<00:06:21.380> like<00:06:21.650> more<00:06:21.890> in<00:06:22.010> the

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
I think another key is like more in the

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.080 
I think another key is like more in the
middle<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.610> cork

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
middle of the cork

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:36.660 
middle of the cork
for<00:06:23.870> example<00:06:24.320> where<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:24.860> F<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:33.500> C<00:06:33.800> major<00:06:34.010> G

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.210 

minor<00:06:37.670> is<00:06:38.060> being<00:06:38.570> an<00:06:38.870> entity<00:06:39.230> so<00:06:41.890> right<00:06:42.890> here

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
minor is being an entity so right here

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.380 
minor is being an entity so right here
in<00:06:43.340> b-flat<00:06:43.900> it's<00:06:44.900> F<00:06:45.670> so<00:06:46.670> this<00:06:46.910> you<00:06:47.030> can<00:06:47.060> do<00:06:47.360> it

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
in b-flat it's F so this you can do it

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.020 
in b-flat it's F so this you can do it
if<00:06:48.140> you<00:06:48.290> just<00:06:48.770> good<00:06:49.040> to<00:06:49.160> you<00:06:49.310> it's<00:06:49.460> just<00:06:49.520> an

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
if you just good to you it's just an

00:06:50.030 --> 00:07:02.809 
if you just good to you it's just an
idea

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.550 

this<00:07:03.819> is<00:07:03.970> the<00:07:04.060> part<00:07:04.330> after<00:07:04.509> the<00:07:04.689> first<00:07:05.080> and

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
this is the part after the first and

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.080 
this is the part after the first and
rather<00:07:06.069> for<00:07:06.400> that<00:07:06.580> we<00:07:07.240> are<00:07:07.830> starting<00:07:08.830> with

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
rather for that we are starting with

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.620 
rather for that we are starting with
course<00:07:10.090> of<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:10.449> song<00:07:10.689> where<00:07:11.379> we
