00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.540
 attention now begins the subject high school biology class you go 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.159
 watch until the half-moon number 37 good studies 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 In this month 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.199
 Sunday 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.679
 mistake 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 the electronic media 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.739
 that's why we went ahead 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.130
 christian horner 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.310
 pulls life and a load of beans 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.020
 bruno braga 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.140
 I already studied at school but I had never seen anything because it is actually said 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 missile up the bed with the plantation 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.680
 I have work here on the site however I take good care of my 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 plants but 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.269
 the korea 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.269
 turozi science brazil 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.400
 is one of the biggest challenges for farmers to control pests in 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.620
 plantations so that the food arrives with good quality in the table of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.490
 people 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.300
 but how do farmers do to fight these pests? 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 on the screen today you will see how the pests that attack the plantations will 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.090
 see how the action of insecticides is and what are the main problems caused 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.430
 for them 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.160
 and will also know the biological control and integrated management 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 it's not just the people who ate beans and rice 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 The story was beautiful. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.090
 In a short time, this little thing can not end this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.110
 plantation 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.700
 but if you do nothing to stop this clear separation that I make 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.080
 only it's not easy 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 There's too much for us to decide. 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 in this respect accommodate us 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.250
 go to the beach 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 It's not easy to end these little critters in the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.590
 Ticiane our side 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.070
 the bicheiro who prefer coffee 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.850
 and evaluates that need never attempted to recompose these animals are called 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.780
 herbivorous animals since basic food grows more 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.869
 is the main 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.640
 It's like Senhor Joao said that these little pets are capable of destroying a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 plant in no time 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.200
 It means that this is always fighting against these pest holders but it is not 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.179
 only 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.269
 about the insects that you have violated psg or not 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.359
 the weeds and the bottoms 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.430
 also can or wants to be any calm calm farmer thing at a time 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.099
 weeds 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.049
 the success 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.849
 look that 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.180
 if you do not take care they will end up with all the minerals in the soil 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.410
 attention to prevent them from growing. 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.809
 close to plantations 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.699
 if you do not know that expression that people use with means that a 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:49.999
 thing is a disgrace 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:50.899
 prepare 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.549
 It would already be a lot of pressure, she says. 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.629
 the traffic was a critical pest today 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.069
 now the backgrounds is easy to imagine 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.139
 they caused diseases in the right plants three men 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.059
 at night says it's a very difficult competition 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.739
 We have to defeat many enemies. 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.750
 planting grow strong without pfdc disease 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.739
 it is true 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.729
 are many enemies even 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.109
 first the herbivorous animals then the weeds that the bottoms 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.959
 to combat so many enemies, farmers rely on the help of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.569
 several weapons we will now know some of them in the action he walks here 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:39.479
 here we have the gifts that we attack here uncertain the fungicides that 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:44.989
 in the combat of funds and here the plug-ins idc that act in control of the 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.859
 weed 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.939
 but lenk the steel zarvos the problem was not solved 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.409
 after all it's only seven in the castrated planting died but it is not 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.709
 well, do not 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.849
 in fact the insecticides add up 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.669
 double-edged sword 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 the Celtic crimes in which they are concerned only one problem of the world 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.349
 if I put insecticide care symptom on that bean plantation 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.089
 I can end the so-called help that is there soon 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.249
 Carol is only one business day 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.419
 Wait there, you're going to stay on the inside too. 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.430
 with the club 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
 good 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.799
 I figured a bean plantation surrounded by character 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.519
 these trees are visited by bees in which they pollinate the flowers of the 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.169
 orange trees 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.469
 now imagine that the bean it is attacked by a plague 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.339
 forcing the farmer to fight the insecticide in the corn plantation 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.189
 Do you know what can happen? 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.269
 the insecticide can kill the bees which in turn will no longer polemize the 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:54.749
 flowers and consequently will not be born more fruits in the orange trees 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.510
 other problem caused 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.720
 by the use of insecticides and the elimination of the natural enemies of pests is this 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.490
 even the use of insecticides can end up with the employer and when you've seen 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.330
 in another screen and the lesson the end of a predator the ex-parliamentary population 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
 of poverty is what happens in the field 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.539
 It gets better uncle 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.659
 is that if the insecticide game for the goat 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.879
 with these little animals that play sings my plantation 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.829
 I can end up also killing another animal that feeds on a plague 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.729
 I understood 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.620
 you can end up killing such a natural enemy 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.440
 and ending with the predators you will increase even more the number of 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.499
 this is the same thing 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.909
 so they could not also fit the farmer to use 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.710
 increasingly stronger products, causing another problem. 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.919
 coca problem this time the resistance of the pests are the insecticides 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.240
 as an antibiotic 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.349
 if we take too much we have to take increasingly stronger doses to make 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:57.940
 against this
