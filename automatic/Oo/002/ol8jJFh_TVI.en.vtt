00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
they really want you to focus less to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
they really want you to focus less to
focus<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.210> carbs<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.290> carb<00:01:13.560> intake<00:01:13.740> and

focus more on carbs your carb intake and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
focus more on carbs your carb intake and
your<00:01:14.430> fat<00:01:14.640> intake<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.270> try<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.170> more

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290

protein and more fiber in your diet
which<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> understand<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> concept<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.360> get

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
which I understand the concept you get

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420
