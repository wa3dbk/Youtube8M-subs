called<00:01:23.340> live<00:01:23.850> tiles<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.630> find<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
called live tiles which I find to be

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
very very useful so let's take a look at

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.899 
very very useful so let's take a look at
one<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> weather

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
one so as you can see here the weather

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.740 
one so as you can see here the weather
right<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.750> Paris<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.590> 12<00:01:31.979> degrees<00:01:32.280> Celsius

16<00:01:33.750> high<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> low<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:38.100> tile<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:39.030> update

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
16 high a low so this tile will update

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.460 
16 high a low so this tile will update
as<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.439> weather<00:01:40.619> changes<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.200> if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> click

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

it then you can get more information
about<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.450> find<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> very

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
having to open up a hole by google

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.100 
having to open up a hole by google
chrome<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.759> weather<00:02:06.719> network

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
chrome and then going to weather network

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.260 
chrome and then going to weather network
and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.680> searching<00:02:08.459> everything<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.149> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and then searching everything up you can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.779 
and then searching everything up you can
just<00:02:09.450> have

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
just have

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.319 
just have
immediately<00:02:11.579> another<00:02:12.579> thing<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:12.879> these

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
immediately another thing that these

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.509 
immediately another thing that these
tiles<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.829> is<00:02:16.769> well<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:18.159> that<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.400> don't

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
tiles do is well one thing that I don't

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.640 
tiles do is well one thing that I don't
like<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.819> these<00:02:19.120> tiles<00:02:19.359> is<00:02:19.689> that<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.409> can't

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
like about these tiles is that you can't

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
like about these tiles is that you can't
change<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.219> background<00:02:21.370> color<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
change the background color of the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.429 
change the background color of the
desktop<00:02:22.900> apps<00:02:23.109> when<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> desktop<00:02:24.430> app<00:02:24.609> is<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:25.439> is

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
desktop apps when a desktop app is is is

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.920 
desktop apps when a desktop app is is is
basically<00:02:26.980> an<00:02:27.400> app<00:02:27.549> design<00:02:27.909> for<00:02:28.269> an<00:02:28.540> older

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
basically an app design for an older

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.660 
basically an app design for an older
version<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.230> windows<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.799> it's<00:02:30.040> only<00:02:30.310> open<00:02:30.459> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
version of windows so it's only open a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.979 
version of windows so it's only open a
bowl<00:02:30.819> or<00:02:31.000> only<00:02:31.750> able<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.349> opened<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
bowl or only able to be opened in the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.050 
bowl or only able to be opened in the
desktop<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.810> desktop<00:02:38.139> environment<00:02:38.799> like<00:02:39.790> for

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
desktop the desktop environment like for

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.210 
desktop the desktop environment like for
example<00:02:40.409> some<00:02:41.409> apps<00:02:41.620> actually<00:02:41.889> I<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.189> two

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
example some apps actually I have two

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.429 
example some apps actually I have two
versions<00:02:42.700> they<00:02:43.150> got<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.389> start<00:02:43.629> menu<00:02:43.930> or

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
version and then they got the desktop

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.240 
version and then they got the desktop
version<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:47.260> example<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:47.769> those<00:02:48.010> is

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
version for example one of those is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.369 
version for example one of those is

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
really the app isn't really different

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.149 
really the app isn't really different
it's<00:03:13.419> just<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.919> look<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.879> app<00:03:16.470> also<00:03:17.470> one

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
it's just the look of the app also one

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.800 
it's just the look of the app also one
thing<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.489> I've<00:03:18.609> noticed<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:19.209> hopefully

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
thing that I've noticed and hopefully

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
chrome is because i can't listen to

8 so far sure there's a little bit

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.580 
8 so far sure there's a little bit
performance<00:06:12.940> boost<00:06:13.940> for<00:06:14.900> example<00:06:15.289> startup

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
performance boost for example startup

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.980 
performance boost for example startup
time<00:06:15.800> I've<00:06:16.340> noticed<00:06:16.759> is<00:06:16.940> quite<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.419> bit<00:06:17.599> faster

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
time I've noticed is quite a bit faster

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.180 
time I've noticed is quite a bit faster
than<00:06:18.020> windows<00:06:18.500> 7<00:06:18.949> took<00:06:19.639> one<00:06:19.879> starting<00:06:20.240> up<00:06:21.190> but

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
than windows 7 took one starting up but

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.619 
than windows 7 took one starting up but
that<00:06:22.280> just<00:06:22.340> might<00:06:22.639> be<00:06:22.819> because<00:06:23.090> I<00:06:23.240> don't<00:06:23.569> have

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
that just might be because I don't have

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.219 
that just might be because I don't have
that<00:06:23.750> many<00:06:24.050> apps<00:06:24.349> on<00:06:24.620> this<00:06:24.770> yet<00:06:25.300> also<00:06:26.300> I'm
