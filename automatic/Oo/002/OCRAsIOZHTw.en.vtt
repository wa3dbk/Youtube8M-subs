00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.950
 greetings youtubers welcome to this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 video this video will try to how 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.100
 through the system symbol activate 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.869
 or disable the administrator account 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.820
 well, the administrator is a 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.770
 user who has windows well reserved 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 out there I do not know why because they do not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 are going to come to the computer jump in order 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 he is crouching 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.590
 to know 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.800
 what by what name is the name called 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 has the administrator because both 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 Windows in Spanish as in English have 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 different names either administrator 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 or administrator or something like that for this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 let's check with the net command 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 Remember enabled users symbol 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.089
 system in administrator mode this is going 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 to tell the users that there are as per 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.720
 example the same in 1992 the guest and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.320
 the administrator now 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.079
 I have activated the account of 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.359
 administrator 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.659
 how it turns off is the first thing I go 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.330
 to teach or easy to see first of all 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.140
 to teach them that if I go here he tells me that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 I can access the administrator ok 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.539
 going back to our desk 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.149
 we write net user notice that up 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.320
 I wrote net booster in this case 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.270
 I will write net usher 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 me neither 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:35.020
 sun and mini degrees 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.020
 bar activate two points no 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.049
 the command has been executed correctly 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.000
 this means that the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 administrator has been hidden 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.570
 we reached the no administrator 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:58.180
 if we return we write net user adminis 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:02:01.580
 worker active bar 2 points 10 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 the command was properly activated 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.300
 now if we go back to our beginning and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.649
 we go and we can reflect and access 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.900
 the administrator account 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.329
 what use will you give to this command 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.959
