as<00:00:01.589> you<00:00:01.770> know<00:00:02.179> this<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.389> an<00:00:04.049> IEP<00:00:05.000> this<00:00:06.000> is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
as you know this is an IEP this is

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.950 
as you know this is an IEP this is
symbolic<00:00:07.160> and<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:10.160> circuit<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
symbolic and this is circuit this is the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.599 
symbolic and this is circuit this is the
circuit<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.740> key<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:15.560> the<00:00:16.560> main<00:00:16.770> problem

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
circuit this is key but the main problem

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.429 
circuit this is key but the main problem
with<00:00:17.960> with<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

it<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.730> problem<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.750> these<00:00:21.990> loose<00:00:22.230> which

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it is a my problem all these loose which

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.220 
it is a my problem all these loose which
is<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.250> problem

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
is my problem

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.380 
is my problem

and<00:01:01.270> should<00:01:01.510> release<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:03.340> old<00:01:03.579> mic<00:01:04.479> with<00:01:04.870> iron

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and should release an old mic with iron

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.730 
and should release an old mic with iron
and<00:01:06.240> reinstall<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:09.180> mic<00:01:10.320> again<00:01:12.060> God<00:01:13.060> willing

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and reinstall this mic again God willing

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.350 
and reinstall this mic again God willing
will<00:01:14.740> work<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.270> its<00:01:16.780> big<00:01:17.700> advice<00:01:18.700> should

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
will work this is its big advice should

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.020 
will work this is its big advice should
be<00:01:19.570> carefully<00:01:20.140> with<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.630> range<00:01:23.580> because<00:01:24.580> it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
be carefully with this range because it

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.530 
be carefully with this range because it
will<00:01:25.270> damage<00:01:26.400> soon<00:01:27.400> if<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.300> don't<00:01:28.570> be<00:01:28.720> careful

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
will damage soon if you don't be careful

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.499 
will damage soon if you don't be careful
this<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.720> record<00:01:32.320> also<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.090> high<00:01:34.450> in

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
this is record also there is a high in

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.800 
this is record also there is a high in
cable<00:01:35.020> there<00:01:35.680> connectors<00:01:36.250> should<00:01:36.810> be

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
cable there connectors should be

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.279 
cable there connectors should be
carefully<00:01:38.350> because<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.250> very<00:01:39.460> hard<00:01:39.729> to

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
carefully because it is very hard to

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.400 
carefully because it is very hard to
disassemble<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.420> carefully<00:01:43.660> circuit

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
disassemble it and we carefully circuit

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.540 
disassemble it and we carefully circuit
try<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.670> make<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.000> clean<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.080> be<00:01:47.950> careful<00:01:48.369> with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
try to make it clean and be careful with

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.710 
try to make it clean and be careful with
Mike<00:01:48.820> don't<00:01:49.690> touch<00:01:49.899> any<00:01:50.320> resistor<00:01:51.310> capacitor

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Mike don't touch any resistor capacitor

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.460 
Mike don't touch any resistor capacitor
around<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.759> hope<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.810> solution<00:01:56.289> will<00:01:56.440> work

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
around it I hope that solution will work

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.410 
around it I hope that solution will work
this<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.570> 93<00:01:59.470> mic<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:01.000> work<00:02:01.240> also<00:02:01.780> an<00:02:03.420> 82

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
this is in 93 mic will work also an 82

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.950 
this is in 93 mic will work also an 82
Mike<00:02:05.020> will<00:02:05.710> work
