00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
mean in a minute my owners did a lot of

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960 
mean in a minute my owners did a lot of
crap<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.020> didn't<00:02:56.290> not<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.470> do<00:02:56.700> there's<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.790> couple

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
crap I didn't not to do there's a couple

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.490 
crap I didn't not to do there's a couple
loose<00:02:58.270> wires<00:02:58.540> right<00:02:58.810> here<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.050> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
loose wires right here like this and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.290 
loose wires right here like this and
then<00:03:02.620> there's<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:02.860> ground<00:03:03.100> wire<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:03.340> I'm

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
then there's a ground wire here I'm

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.910 
then there's a ground wire here I'm
assuming<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.810> ground<00:03:07.530> I'm<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
assuming it's ground I'm going to get a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.500 
assuming it's ground I'm going to get a
CD<00:03:09.190> player<00:03:09.370> for<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.670> car<00:03:09.880> since<00:03:10.330> it's<00:03:10.450> only

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
