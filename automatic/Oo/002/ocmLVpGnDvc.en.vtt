you're<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> guy<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:13.080> story<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.710> far<00:00:14.000> if<00:00:15.000> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
you're a guy the story so far if you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.880 
you're a guy the story so far if you
divide<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.719> force<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.199> get<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
divide the force you get out of a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.550 
divide the force you get out of a
machine<00:00:17.279> by<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> force<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
machine by the force you put into it you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830 
machine by the force you put into it you
will<00:00:19.680> discover<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.400> mechanical<00:00:21.240> advantage

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
will discover the mechanical advantage

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
will discover the mechanical advantage
of<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.260> machine<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.609> since<00:00:23.939> every<00:00:24.210> machine

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of that machine but since every machine

its<00:00:27.510> mechanical<00:00:28.080> advantage<00:00:28.560> will<00:00:28.740> always<00:00:29.099> be

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
its mechanical advantage will always be

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.849 
its mechanical advantage will always be
reduced<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.000> extent<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> force<00:00:31.560> of

yes the road a winding Mountain Road is
a<00:01:11.880> machine<00:01:12.299> -<00:01:12.689> hey<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:14.070> suppose<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> road

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
a machine - hey well suppose the road

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.649 
a machine - hey well suppose the road
didn't<00:01:15.180> why

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
didn't why

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
didn't why
suppose<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> went<00:01:16.680> straight<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> side<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
suppose it went straight up the side of

suppose it went straight up the side of
the<00:01:17.939> mountain<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.159> shorter<00:01:20.189> way

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the mountain this is a much shorter way

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.929 
the mountain this is a much shorter way
to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:21.119> isn't<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.130> yet<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.369> won't<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to the top isn't and yet it won't do you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
to the top isn't and yet it won't do you
much<00:01:23.970> good<00:01:24.290> because<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> engine<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> even

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
much good because the engine of even

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
much good because the engine of even
your<00:01:26.670> magnificent<00:01:27.390> automobile<00:01:27.930> hasn't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
your magnificent automobile hasn't

your magnificent automobile hasn't
enough<00:01:28.979> force<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> lift<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.090> cars<00:01:30.360> straight

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
enough force to lift your cars straight

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.100 
enough force to lift your cars straight
up<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:32.610> suppose<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> road<00:01:33.750> long

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
up but suppose we make the road long

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
up but suppose we make the road long
enough<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.159> slope<00:01:35.460> gentle<00:01:36.030> enough<00:01:36.240> for

enough and the slope gentle enough for

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
enough and the slope gentle enough for
you<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> drive<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> mountain<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.070> ease

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you to drive up the mountain with ease

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.800 
you to drive up the mountain with ease
what<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.689> done<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.460> yes<00:01:41.460> we've<00:01:42.329> made<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
what have we done now yes we've made the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
what have we done now yes we've made the
road<00:01:43.020> into<00:01:43.530> an<00:01:43.649> inclined<00:01:44.159> plane<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.850> simple

road into an inclined plane a simple
machine<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.090> expensive<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
machine but that's an expensive way to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
awfully long ramp what if we wrap the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
awfully long ramp what if we wrap the

four times the length of the other they

four times the length of the other they
