00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 three dead and more than 20 injured this 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.680
 was the result of the collapse of a building 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.719
 this morning in the Palancha 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 but everything was a simulation for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.990
 training of the fire brigade and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 civil defense 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.300
 the similarity with reality called the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 people's attention this is a connection 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.529
 for the 193 in the body. 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 firefighters 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.210
 you are the body collapsed in a fire 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.630
 building here the nac on the palan a building 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.809
 collapsed have a lot of victim in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 street joÃ£o os us the teams of the zone 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 central and south were triggered 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 immediately that 26 victims would be 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.750
 under the rubble of the building that collapsed 3 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.039
 of them would be dead and another seven in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 serious condition 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 13 minutes was the time it took 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 that the eight vehicles of the body of 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.640
 firefighters arrived at the 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.040
 but all this was nothing more than a 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.050
 The objective of the training was to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.670
 firefighters are 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.950
 situation like this 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.050
 they were surprised when they arrived 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.450
 and they knew it was a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.800
 simulation already found safe can not 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.820
 log in shortly it will now enter the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.070
 car but this simulation seemed real there 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.370
 inside the collapsed building 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 there was lots of shouting and confusion people 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.990
 asking for help and help 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.640
 they were all answered as if they were 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.050
 they were even going through a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 this situation 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.610
 the firefighters provided care and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.490
 then sent the dead and wounded 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.470
 to the outside the goal was this 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.990
 keep the surprise and take it by surprise 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.550
 prepared to enter into service because 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.369
 usually in such a case we do 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.110
 briefings meetings facex seminars 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.700
 exposes what each has to do and 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.710
 purpose this time was to test the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.049
 firefighters 500 services with factor 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.090
 Surprised they are perfectly 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.220
 equal the same structure but the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.290
 surprise factor that was differentiation for 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.880
 to act is safe 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.799
 Calm down and do what you have to do. 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.180
 which is to ensure maximum comfort and 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.950
 survival more people the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 shortest possible time for the first time 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 in history a simulation like this has been 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.049
 developed here in London involving 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.380
 the collapse of a building and this test 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.290
 and evaluation brought here about 60 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.870
 firefighters and a detail of all this is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.030
 that many of them are still doing the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.580
 training course to enter the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
 the victims, even because of the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.410
 risk that is the structure was launched the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.239
 imminent risk of iron tip fell 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.700
 Debris carry under rubble to people 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.590
 preferred to opted for the chose the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.570
 students of the firefighter who already 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.250
 have had the material to 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.530
 prevention is already taking care of the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.209
 and they will look from the top 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.100
 down the machine a look also 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.530
 help us evaluated yesterday the attendant 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.170
 all the alleged victims of this 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 are students who still do the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.870
 training course for soldiers of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.959
 firemen 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.790
 is the case of victor and tainara they were 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.040
 make-up to give more reality 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.920
 Where's the scene of disarmament and saw the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.780
 close for the first time how the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.280
 help in such a scenario the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.379
 first time doing the education 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.790
 does not call it quite interesting is that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.769
 will probably go through 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.209
 like that when you graduate from the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.620
 however it is quite interesting to see 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.909
 in practice even in practice people 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.370
 learn a lot more 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.890
 You will already be realized there is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.319
 I already look at the firemen 's 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.569
 is not doing it alone anymore. 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.909
 adding to us and this simulation 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.810
 brought panic to the residents of the 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.150
 region 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.730
 many were scared because they did not 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.919
 knew the simulation did not know if 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.319
 someone taking what had fallen because 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.430
 there were people falling on top in the middle and 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.950
 down 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.590
 there were a lot of people in this show 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.930
 One chance I was desperate too. 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.329
 my sister came and spoke with us 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.689
 you have a tragedy 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.400
 So I came here and stayed with the 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.439
 wobbly legs that now speak to 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.530
 the Major even quieted some 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:18.099
 residents who came to see this 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.289
 simulation page 15 a simulation by 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.479
 girl more true than anything else 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.050
 if this was a simulation this is 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.889
 No, teacher. 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.990
 to believe 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.190
 a young woman who personally talks with 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.560
 and convince them that it was a 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.199
 simulation but then she understood the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.340
 importance of this work to train 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.180
 the professionals 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 a similar situation
