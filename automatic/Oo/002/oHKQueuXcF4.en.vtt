00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I haven't used before I found these at

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
a shot they did pretty good prison the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.060 
a shot they did pretty good prison the

some<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> future<00:00:37.100> for<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.160> drawing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
some more in the future for this drawing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.680 
some more in the future for this drawing
I<00:00:38.850> used<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.760> zero<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> zero<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.160> width<00:00:44.690> which

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
I used the zero the zero one width which

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.549 
I used the zero the zero one width which
I<00:00:45.840> suppose<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:48.289> don't<00:00:49.289> know

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I suppose is like I don't know

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
I suppose is like I don't know
that's<00:00:50.520> pretty<00:00:50.700> standardized<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> guess<00:00:51.719> with

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that's pretty standardized I guess with

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's pretty standardized I guess with
the<00:00:51.930> other<00:00:52.170> fineliners<00:00:55.039> anyway<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.940> haven't

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the other fineliners anyway so I haven't

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
the other fineliners anyway so I haven't
uploaded<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.289> video<00:00:58.410> recently<00:00:59.090> which<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.300> of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the next place I guess and the most

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.990 
the next place I guess and the most
difficult<00:02:47.780> part<00:02:48.290> about<00:02:48.349> moving<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.129> keeps

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
difficult part about moving is keeps

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.860 
difficult part about moving is keeps
making<00:02:50.209> text<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.019> more<00:02:51.260> complicated<00:02:51.949> but<00:02:52.870> but

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
making text is more complicated but but

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.229 
making text is more complicated but but
yeah<00:02:54.519> Chicago<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.579> really<00:02:55.609> interesting<00:02:56.209> so

this<00:04:17.539> drawing<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.459> said<00:04:19.639> I<00:04:19.669> used<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.269> little

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
this drawing like I said I used a little

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.120 
this drawing like I said I used a little
fine<00:04:21.169> liner<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.709> just<00:04:21.919> did

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
fine liner and I just did

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.080 
fine liner and I just did
lots<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.340> little<00:04:22.490> kind<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:24.280> contour<00:04:25.280> lines<00:04:25.640> I

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
lots of little kind of contour lines I

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.240 
lots of little kind of contour lines I
kind<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.840> at<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.380> beginning<00:04:27.470> there<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> kind<00:04:28.160> of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
kind of at the beginning there I kind of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.600 
kind of at the beginning there I kind of
followed<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:30.220> kind<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.280> followed<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
followed the kind of followed the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.770 
followed the kind of followed the
principle<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.320> used<00:04:33.620> in<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.780> overcoming

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
principle that I used in the overcoming

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.340 
principle that I used in the overcoming
artist<00:04:36.140> block<00:04:36.460> where<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.490> did<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.350> topographic

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
artist block where I did the topographic

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.290 
artist block where I did the topographic
map<00:04:39.590> thing<00:04:40.100> where<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.550> kind<00:04:40.760> of<00:04:40.820> followed

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
map thing where I just kind of followed

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.450 
map thing where I just kind of followed
an<00:04:41.480> outlined<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.110> stuff<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.310> just

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
an outlined and stuff and then I just

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.270 
an outlined and stuff and then I just
kind<00:04:43.670> of<00:04:43.730> expanded<00:04:44.330> from<00:04:44.510> there<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.220> of

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
kind of expanded from there and kind of

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.040 
kind of expanded from there and kind of
made<00:04:46.460> cloud<00:04:46.820> shapes<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:48.730> don't<00:04:49.730> know<00:04:49.790> I

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
made cloud shapes and I don't know I

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.450 
made cloud shapes and I don't know I
think<00:04:51.050> this<00:04:51.350> could<00:04:51.410> be<00:04:51.740> interesting<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.250> color

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
think this could be interesting to color

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.340 
think this could be interesting to color
in<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.760> upcoming<00:04:53.300> coloring<00:04:53.630> book<00:04:53.810> next<00:04:54.020> year
