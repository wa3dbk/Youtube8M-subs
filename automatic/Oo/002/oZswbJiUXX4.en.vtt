00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:11.800
 experimental mp today we are going to clean the 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.349
 today we are going to pick up the birdseed 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.010
 the feeders and we will clean what 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:22.390
 we have here birdseed to clean 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.890
 sad dirty with husk is worth in a 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.130
 container 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.330
 we have votes to recover the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 seeds but birdseed 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.390
 let's start we have a bottle 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 we were done a few holes worth 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 with wide mouth 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.719
 we have another bottle that has been cut 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.679
 in the shape of the funnel to put it here 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.679
 ok and now we have a vacuum cleaner with the 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.949
 that we're going to clean up in pitchers what 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.660
 let's throw the birdseed in the bottle 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 to clean 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.860
 we'll see 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 two 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.400
 we have arrived the bottle and now we are going 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.400
 to turn on the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:55.680
 we have here the vacuum cleaner we removed 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.230
 what we used in the funnel 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.740
 We turn on the vacuum cleaner and aspire to 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.740
 the bottle 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.390
 here what is happening in the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 following 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.100
 with the holes tempting air and is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.370
 raising all the husk all the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.819
 little friends the dirt the corvo with the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140
 vaccum cleaner 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.170
 we move the bottle to mix 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 all right 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.790
 and now that we have the artist 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.280
 while we see visitors flying around 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.720
 inside the bottle is that there is still 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.720
 some husk 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.569
 we are not going to make precise 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.249
 and let's say we have half 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.249
 we stop the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.749
 and let's see where is the husk 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.749
 the item on the grill 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.190
 the dirt what is not worth 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.540
 all dirty all the little girl the dust in 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.569
 The vacuum cleaner 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.880
 the bottle 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.860
 we have the birdseed already 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.600
 clean vale 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.030
 let's talk with engine that already 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.900
 previously clean 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.900
 so you see 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.220
 here you have the birdseed some husk 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.910
 brad we are not precise but good 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.910
 now we do the following dirty canary 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.540
 we see with husk 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.610
 I call him 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.610
 you are cleaning 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.130
 another to clean 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.370
 the feeder 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.370
 with the clean connect recovered 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.450
 this dirty to dirty to return to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.450
 clean it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.250
 the seed if you want to see it you see that 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.250
 it's clean 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.510
 clean carats 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.259
 clean seed 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.840
 proof of the dirty one also and with 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.730
 husk 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.110
 which we are running from the feeders 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.810
 if it stays that way 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.270
 cleansed 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.460
 and we have already recovered what 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.759
 we can say that he had thrown 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.110
 to the trash with this we are 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:58.750
 economizing in a cheap way 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.960
 who has a bird two because they do not 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:06.020
 supposes that it supposes little thing but I for 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.770
 example with a large aviary as 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.120
 I think a lot of kilos throw out 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.419
 of one month 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.960
 and with this I hope you have served 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.960
 the idea 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.610
 the seed for recovered 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.610
 to clean 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.940
 funnel a bottle carries another bottle 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.720
 with a wide mouth full of little hole 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.720
 so that the air does not increase 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.479
 and any vacuum cleaner that we have in 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:46.309
 house let's forget about those machines 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:50.529
 that you have to put with tablitas a 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:50.529
 cut it and make us 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.580
 to recover the seed the machine 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.759
 seeds to clean or buy 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.879
 at a price of 50 to 60 euros for me the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:06.479
 bottle is more economical and good with 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.150
 I hope this has served you and nothing 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.870
 you can visit me in the aviary 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.870
