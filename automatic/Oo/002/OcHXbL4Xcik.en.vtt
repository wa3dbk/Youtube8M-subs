are<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.789> iPhone<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:23.539> started<00:00:24.539> by<00:00:24.630> getting

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
are from my iPhone I started by getting

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.660 
are from my iPhone I started by getting
some<00:00:25.170> general<00:00:25.529> measurements<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> stage

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
some general measurements of the stage

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.759 
some general measurements of the stage
the<00:00:27.090> stage<00:00:27.300> height<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> angles<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the stage height some of the angles and

the stage height some of the angles and
the<00:00:28.949> area<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.250> had<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> work<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> went

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the area I had to work in then I went

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
the area I had to work in then I went
into<00:00:31.439> Sketchup<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.250> designed<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.360> couple

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
into Sketchup and designed up a couple

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
into Sketchup and designed up a couple
proofs<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> could<00:00:34.980> show<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> director

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
proofs so that I could show the director

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
proofs so that I could show the director
to<00:00:36.059> help<00:00:36.239> her<00:00:36.390> visualize<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.469> going

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
to help her visualize what it was going

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.319 
to help her visualize what it was going
to<00:00:37.680> look<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> stairs<00:00:39.030> leading

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to look like here are the stairs leading

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
to look like here are the stairs leading
up<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> second<00:00:40.260> story<00:00:40.290> they're<00:00:41.010> hidden

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
up to the second story they're hidden

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.639 
up to the second story they're hidden
from<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> audience's<00:00:42.149> view<00:00:42.469> here's<00:00:43.469> an

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
from the audience's view here's an

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
from the audience's view here's an
aerial<00:00:43.980> shot<00:00:44.690> there<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:45.989> existing

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
aerial shot there was an existing

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
aerial shot there was an existing
platform<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> came<00:00:47.370> off<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> stage<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.300> just

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
platform that came off the stage I just

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.060 
platform that came off the stage I just
reinforced<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:49.649> bit

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
reinforced it a little bit

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
reinforced it a little bit
once<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.059> started<00:00:51.420> building<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> stairs<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
once I started building the stairs the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
once I started building the stairs the
upright<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> handrail<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.360> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
upright and then the handrail it all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.529 
upright and then the handrail it all
went<00:00:54.870> together<00:00:54.989> pretty<00:00:55.350> quickly<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
went together pretty quickly here you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
went together pretty quickly here you
can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> started<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> attach<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
can see I started to attach the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.060 
can see I started to attach the
styrofoam<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.910> used<00:01:00.149> foam<00:01:00.840> board<00:01:01.140> adhesive<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
styrofoam I used foam board adhesive the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.579 
styrofoam I used foam board adhesive the
little<00:01:02.420> plywood<00:01:03.420> chunks<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:03.989> screwed<00:01:04.350> into

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
little plywood chunks are screwed into

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
little plywood chunks are screwed into
the<00:01:04.769> structural<00:01:05.369> member<00:01:05.670> until<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> adhesive

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the structural member until the adhesive

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.830 
the structural member until the adhesive
cures<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> radius<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> tower<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.150> 7<00:01:09.540> feet

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
cures the radius of the tower is 7 feet

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.990 
cures the radius of the tower is 7 feet
that's<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> smallville<00:01:11.340> radius<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's about a smallville radius as you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's about a smallville radius as you
can<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> 1-inch<00:01:12.960> styrofoam<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
can go with the 1-inch styrofoam to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
can go with the 1-inch styrofoam to
avoid<00:01:14.070> cracking<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> drew

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
avoid cracking you can see that I drew

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
avoid cracking you can see that I drew
lines<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> sharpie<00:01:17.520> marker<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> size

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
lines with a sharpie marker for the size

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
lines with a sharpie marker for the size
of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> block<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
of the block on the right you can see it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.380 
of the block on the right you can see it
after<00:01:21.119> texturing<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:25.100> also<00:01:26.100> attached<00:01:26.700> other

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
after texturing I also attached other

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
after texturing I also attached other
styrofoam<00:01:28.110> around<00:01:28.409> doorways<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.009> windows<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
styrofoam around doorways and windows to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
styrofoam around doorways and windows to
give<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.030> bit<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.450> depth<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
give it a little bit more depth here you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.230 
give it a little bit more depth here you
can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> those<00:01:32.490> plywood<00:01:32.970> blocks

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
can see more of those plywood blocks

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
can see more of those plywood blocks
that<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.689> securing<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> foam<00:01:34.530> until<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that are securing the foam until the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
that are securing the foam until the
adhesive<00:01:35.369> cures<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.540> foam<00:01:36.780> went<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
adhesive cures the foam went up

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
adhesive cures the foam went up
relatively<00:01:37.710> quickly<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
relatively quickly it's just the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.840 
relatively quickly it's just the
texturising<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.380> tedious

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
texturising that can be a bit tedious

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
texturising that can be a bit tedious
here<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.360> me<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.810> heat<00:01:43.079> gun

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
here you can see me with a heat gun

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
here you can see me with a heat gun
going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> grout<00:01:44.250> lines<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.210> grout<00:01:45.420> lines

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
going to the grout lines the grout lines

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.289 
going to the grout lines the grout lines
can<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.020> created<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.770> router<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> cold

can be created with a router with a cold
bit<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.560> even<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:49.979> an<00:01:50.220> exacto

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
bit or you can even just use an exacto

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
bit or you can even just use an exacto
knife<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> hot<00:01:52.259> wire<00:01:52.500> cutting

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
texture with a heat gun once you get in

a<00:02:46.590> rhythm<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.950> those<00:02:47.100> 15<00:02:49.160> here's<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the texture added by the heat gun it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.150 
the texture added by the heat gun it's
definitely<00:02:55.050> starting<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.410> look<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.860> brick

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
definitely starting to look like brick

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
definitely starting to look like brick
but<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.670> looks<00:02:56.850> even<00:02:57.150> better<00:02:57.269> once<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.720> start

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
but it looks even better once you start

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
but it looks even better once you start
getting<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> paint<00:02:58.500> done<00:02:58.910> here<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.180> see

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
getting the paint done here you can see

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.720 
getting the paint done here you can see
where<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> foam<00:03:00.930> panels<00:03:01.350> come<00:03:01.590> together<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
where the foam panels come together to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.580 
where the foam panels come together to
eliminate<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.299> view<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.630> any<00:03:03.780> type<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.049> seam<00:03:04.440> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
eliminate the view of any type of seam I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.470 
eliminate the view of any type of seam I
just<00:03:04.769> use<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> little<00:03:05.070> drywall<00:03:05.610> joint<00:03:05.940> compound

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
just use a little drywall joint compound

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.750 
just use a little drywall joint compound
and<00:03:06.810> once<00:03:07.470> there's<00:03:07.680> paint<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.430> seam<00:03:08.610> is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and once there's paint on it the seam is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.930 
and once there's paint on it the seam is
invisible<00:03:09.769> here<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.890> started<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.340> spray<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.790> the
