00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi everyone i'm k 10x out of 1 and in this 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 new video I will demonstrate how to pass the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
 level 1 of the famous game known as 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 cat bros to those who do not know him 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.250
 I will make a brief explanation is a game 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.260
 with many traps what makes it 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.020
 quite difficult but with practice 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.359
 you can do what I do in this video 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.840
 pass in the video I said pass the video 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 or now I'm lime here the favorite vato 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 of the children x of TV I was made 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.700
 known happens the video that I am 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.059
 angry or good we enter with lucifer in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.800
 October 90 and down to how many times you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.800
 I have to say that my name is cat man 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.610
 see that block is the first trap not 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.710
 you can grab the item but there is a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 trick to grab the block item 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 Whats Next 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.490
 and ready 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.210
 that's the way but if you do it wrong 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:16.049
 an invisible block will appear as they have 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.049
 seen in that block take a coin xd xd 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.049
 xddddd 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.439
 I forgot trap 4 which is this the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.439
 3 is the block with an enemy let's follow 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.380
 look at this trap bothers a lot 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.040
 I trained myself to pass it so you 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.040
 do the same 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:21.580
 and if you want they can shoot the monkeys 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:25.690

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.640
 flying and do what I 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.760
 the third is the expired one and if it does not come out 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.700
 he sent them with a skull or face here 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.470
 secret he is looking for a job what 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.490
 bad is that my voice will take away what 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.920

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.220

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:12.460
 Wait, I've achieved it 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:16.050
