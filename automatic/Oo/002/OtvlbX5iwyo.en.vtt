I have to do is hit this option in the
top<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:41.069> corner<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.379> transcoding<00:02:43.379> will

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
top right corner and transcoding will

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.460 
top right corner and transcoding will
begin<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.940> once<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.510> done<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.260> view

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
begin and once this is done I can view

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
begin and once this is done I can view
the<00:02:46.739> final<00:02:47.670> result<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.810> transcoding

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the final result of this transcoding

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.140 
the final result of this transcoding
it'll<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> same<00:02:50.160> video<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:50.910> new

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it'll be the same video but with new

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.240 
it'll be the same video but with new
audio<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> background<00:02:52.230> sometimes<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
audio in the background sometimes the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
audio in the background sometimes the
transcoding<00:02:53.849> does<00:02:54.120> take<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.360> little<00:02:54.569> bit<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
transcoding does take a little bit of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.770 
transcoding does take a little bit of
time<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.380> does<00:02:55.530> use<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> lot<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.130> CPU<00:02:56.780> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
time and it does use a lot of the CPU so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.199 
time and it does use a lot of the CPU so
keep<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.709> mind<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.519> once<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.060> done

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
keep that in mind so once this is done

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.400 
keep that in mind so once this is done
we<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.510> hit<00:03:00.810> view<00:03:01.110> result<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:04.049> let's<00:03:04.290> go

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
we can hit view result and let's go

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.110 
we can hit view result and let's go
ahead<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.650> watch<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.069> new<00:03:05.220> video<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.849> the
