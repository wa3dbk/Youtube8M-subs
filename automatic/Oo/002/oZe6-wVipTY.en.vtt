00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 today we talk but no mushrooms we 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 today talk about moonshine and whiskey 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 the old days the Scots did their 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
 drink 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.000
 whiskey and poured roughly 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 Scottish moonshine and poured into oak 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.129
 barrels but once 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 they did not have enough barrels and they decided 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.000
 buy them the meanest Spaniards who 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.019
 slipped and sara and bowl earlobes in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.100
 which they kept sherry brought 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.370
 sold in thirtieth proud Scot and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.260
 swam away 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.030
 their distant country and the Scots remained 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 with these sherry barrels 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.850
 nothing to do when you figure it out 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.909
 whiskey your need to pour 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.119
 spat proud Scots on pride and 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.260
 flooded 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.960
 your home brew in these oak barrels barrels 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.630
 from sherry 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.970
 a year later they tried and not something 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.030
 it turned out we were pleasantly surprised by the taste 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:36.630
 was very nice and tasty 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 since then the Scots began to produce 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.659
 your whiskey on this visa tour that is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.470
 take oak barrels stand first 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.120
 down through 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.460
 and then pour their usual moonshine 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.570
 then they sell us in a way like 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.340
 scotch whiskey 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.429
 today we will try to do 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.009
 about the same as our own 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.950
 different sapsany whiskey yes nothing 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.250
 Only those that Scotch whiskey 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.620
 aged at least a year and our 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.650
 moonshine does not have time you hold on because 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.140
 that it is drunk much earlier, we 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.870
 let's try to check this case here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.900
 oak barrel well of course not so 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:34.250
 big as spanish here but still 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:38.849
 made of oak in it we kept 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.329
 several months ordinary series which 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.329
 of course then used by appointment and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.410
 Now in this barrel here we fill our 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.410
 native domestic moonshine 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.440
 and in order to adsorb 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.760
 Is it a variety of unnecessary impurities we 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.860
 add there is such 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:20.500
 yeah crustacean answer too oak this one 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.209
 charcoal it will add some taste 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.760
 certain and harmfulness 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.000
 soak yourself well then let 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.000
 let's get started 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.200
 moonshine is a good fortress 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.200
 50 degrees 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.380
 now I am Scots others 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.160
 manufacturers 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:17.600
 oak barrels burned from the inside but we 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.330
 We will not disassemble our barrel 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:31.510
 add just 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:31.510
 ember them now omit this thing 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:43.870
 we cork and plow cool 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:50.979
 basement place to more or less 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:54.520
 temperature was the same for 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:58.770
 scaffolding so she flashes alice attack 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.770
 metal poured into the channel
