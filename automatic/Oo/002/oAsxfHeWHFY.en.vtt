00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:30.720

 Accessories the hearing aids very good but 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.030
 but no 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.030
 the wire 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 micro-usb 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.640
 It can be seen 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.740
 and a being loaded a little big but 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.670
 is 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.379
 everything works fine 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.110
 good this within the characteristics 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.449
 of this phone as it is a 3g phone 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.860
 as wifi as most of the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.120
 smartphones 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.480
 this an email an android 2.3 brings a 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.720
 4 inch display chamber 5 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.380
 megapixels with led flash and slot for 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 micro SD 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 the screen looks very good is the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.120
 screen with the resolution ratio of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.300
 400 x 800 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.030
 the truth I know 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 it looks great the screen offers you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.050
 RAM of 512 and you're free to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.820
 for other games and applications are left 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.820
 officially 200 megs 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.760
 It has a one-giga hertz processor 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.610
 when it does a lot 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.130
 because it will be quite functional one 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.250
 internal memory of 1GB free for your 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.250
 applications and so on and so you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 give a microsd of 8 gigas something very 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 good a very good point 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.080
 the phone is very fluid 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.990
 Now I bring you a launcher because if 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.270
 the launcher that comes with the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.150
 phone is not very nice 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.480
 truth is something that lanix lacks 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.340
 work on your designs also in the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.070
 design of your accessories are missing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.990
 work a bit on that I think but it's 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.040
 well everything pulls very well 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.040
 very fluid 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.890
 the truth this offers you very good 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.180
 features at a good price do not 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.930
 nothing has failed 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.070
 the design of the phone 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.290
 this is nice is 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.410
 ergonomic you can touch it very well has 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.140
 the back a gummy texture 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.600
 what feels nice and helps you to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.830
 that does not leave traces if you see it does not leave 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.980
 paw print 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.220
 has here the logo of telsen why 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 it is especially to grow here 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.450
 its 5 megapixel camera led flash 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.849
 the slot of the micro usb input 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.349
 the ignition at the entrance of the 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.819
 headphone jack 3.5 mm and 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.819
 studio keys hard volume 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.750
 right now this phone is the most 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.480
 new that lanix has taken me told me the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.659
 third that is working the knicks 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.430
 to get phones already high-end and 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.590
 Well, let's hope that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.859
 that are a little better than these but 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.329
 it really works very well on the phone 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:54.129
 let's put this game so you see 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.129
 that if you cut very fluid 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.590
 the temple room 2 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.680
 there it is already we are going to play the attitude 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.220
 the volume the horn will be heard the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.220
 true very well 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.940
 it does not sound giant like others 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.440
 phones you hear has a little bit of 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.440
 resonance and it sounds good 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.789
 everything very well the phone works very 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.629
 well it continues well placed other hearing aids 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.629
 they are and 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.610
 the truth is heard well 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.620
 he brings us his music player and everything 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.340
 the rest gallery and others like any 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.310
 another smartphone 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.000
 This is the music player 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.000
 songs playlists 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.819
 up to your gallery 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.699
 it looks pretty nice pretty nice 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.979
 but that has that effect of when 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.660
 we move the phone they tilt the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.340
 Photos 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.040
 according to the severity 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.300
 they look very good the images have as 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.300
 I say, you have a very good resolution 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.009
 everything very well I'm decided to upload this 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.639
 video because many asked that if 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.190
 what does it have to do and how does it work? 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.750
 I really did not find another one that made a 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.190
 telephone reviews and that's why I decided 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.009
 do it for people who have 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.960
 doubts and the best are not convinced because 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.460
 it's not a well-known brand it 's a 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.009
 brand that is starting in this from the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.220
 smartphones but well here it is 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:51.160
 very good running 3.3 can not 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.240
 update I imagine that yes you can 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.240
 more ahead is down 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.620
 this runs games 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.270
 pretty good like dead 3 to 7 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.440
 of wheat 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.440
 then he runs them very well 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:12.260
 and then this would be all 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.009
 I hope it will help them and help them 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:19.309
 say goodbye so if you are looking 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.369
 a phone with good characteristics to 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:25.960
 a good price because now I do 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:29.009
 I recommend it works very well 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.009
 that's all
