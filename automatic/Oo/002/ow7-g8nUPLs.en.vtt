00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
later it'll thicken up first but I've

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.050 
later it'll thicken up first but I've
skin<00:02:14.720> off<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> male<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:16.880> which

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
skin off and have a male in here which

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.050 
skin off and have a male in here which
needs<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.510> pick<00:02:18.350> up<00:02:18.530> quite<00:02:18.740> nicely<00:02:18.910> we<00:02:19.910> then

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
needs to be pick up quite nicely we then

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.510 
needs to be pick up quite nicely we then
cut<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.390> into<00:02:20.540> chunks

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
cut that into chunks

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.120 
cut that into chunks
so<00:02:22.520> most<00:02:22.790> size<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.780> plate<00:02:24.590> size<00:02:24.860> pieces

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
so most size this is plate size pieces

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.420 
so most size this is plate size pieces
so<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.530> was<00:02:27.709> reaching<00:02:27.950> at<00:02:28.250> within<00:02:29.120> easily

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
so that I was reaching at within easily

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.140 
so that I was reaching at within easily
enjoy<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.959> okay<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.440> would<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:34.150> melon

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
and a portion and a chunk so a young I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.530 
and a portion and a chunk so a young I
thought<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.610> would<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.760> half<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.300> portion

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
thought that would be half a portion

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960 
thought that would be half a portion
