00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
dude and then it's just like localized

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.889 
dude and then it's just like localized
emission<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> level<00:00:39.690> where<00:00:39.870> we

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
emission so this was a level where we

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
emission so this was a level where we
were<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.200> into<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> crypt<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.340> nacho<00:00:41.730> DOM

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
were going into the crypt of nacho DOM

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
were going into the crypt of nacho DOM
deals<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> things<00:00:43.110> deal<00:00:43.440> some<00:00:43.649> stuff<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
deals and things deal some stuff and it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
deals and things deal some stuff and it
was<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> level<00:00:44.700> saying<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.690> stuff<00:00:45.989> we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
was a level saying how much stuff we

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
was a level saying how much stuff we
could<00:00:46.289> steal<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.340> seen

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
could steal and the more you got seen
the<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> level<00:00:49.050> went<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.440> get

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
unfortunate I tried to cover this like

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.459 
unfortunate I tried to cover this like
this<00:00:57.239> stealth<00:00:57.480> mechanics<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> big

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
this stealth mechanics in that was a big

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
this stealth mechanics in that was a big
thing<00:00:58.739> stealth<00:00:59.070> mechanics<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.670> good<00:01:00.030> while

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
thing stealth mechanics are good while

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.490 
thing stealth mechanics are good while
you<00:01:00.359> hold<00:01:00.600> left<00:01:00.809> trigger<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> crunch

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you hold left trigger and you crunch

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
you hold left trigger and you crunch
down<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> push<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> cover<00:01:03.329> or

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
down and then you can push a to cover or

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
down and then you can push a to cover or
X<00:01:03.870> whatever<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.680> hover<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.949> remember<00:01:05.369> and

combat and Assassin's Creed one the kids

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.999 
combat and Assassin's Creed one the kids
he<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.780> carrying<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.770> like

getting hit with a counter-attack and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.760 
getting hit with a counter-attack and
this<00:01:24.479> seems<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> same<00:01:25.170> yeah<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> the

tonight<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.120> nice<00:04:33.419> addition<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:33.870> it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
tonight a nice addition but it

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.820 
tonight a nice addition but it
definitely<00:04:34.080> looks<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:35.789> feels<00:04:36.060> like<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.830> little

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
definitely looks and feels like a little

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.589 
definitely looks and feels like a little
slight<00:04:38.129> conversion<00:04:38.819> you<00:04:39.000> version<00:04:39.330> two<00:04:39.419> are<00:04:39.509> an

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
slight conversion you version two are an

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.390 
slight conversion you version two are an
expansion<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.169> Black<00:04:40.379> Flag's<00:04:40.650> exactly<00:04:41.190> looks

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
expansion of Black Flag's exactly looks

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.499 
expansion of Black Flag's exactly looks
like<00:04:41.520> exact<00:04:41.729> same<00:04:41.879> kind<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.090> gameplay<00:04:42.360> with

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
like exact same kind of gameplay with

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.610 
like exact same kind of gameplay with
additional<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.840> little<00:04:43.020> bit<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.319> if<00:04:43.379> you<00:04:43.470> like

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
additional a little bit so if you like

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.110 
additional a little bit so if you like
lifelike<00:04:44.069> then<00:04:44.310> you'll<00:04:44.729> probably<00:04:44.849> like<00:04:45.090> a

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
lifelike then you'll probably like a

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.339 
lifelike then you'll probably like a
different<00:04:45.539> part<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.780> world<00:04:45.870> as<00:04:46.110> well<00:04:46.199> as

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
different part of the world as well as

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.659 
different part of the world as well as

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
sort of Pacific northeast apparently of

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.550
