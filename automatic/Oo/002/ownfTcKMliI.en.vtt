00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.810
 / acto is a pedagogical project that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.490
 emerges from conversations 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.260
 of university extension of the 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.300
 faculty of fine arts of the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 Universidad Complutense de Madrid that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 is formed by cella blasco lilac 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.840
 insÃºa and alejandro simÃ³n we were 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.420
 talking about the need to connect the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 street with faculty and faculty with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.040
 the street and continue this work a bit 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 that they had been doing as soon as 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.809
 we raise it to the bank foundation 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.120
 santander understood perfectly that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.490
 was within your line of support to the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.740
 contemporary art education and that 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.900
 Support contemporary art in Spain 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.470
 also went to support education 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.140
 in the arts 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.600
 this project involves many agents and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.240
 it is precisely this that results 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.920
 interesting because right now for 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.290
 take out a project any project 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.970
 ahead it is necessary to have many 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.190
 networks that are supporting and that contribute 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.410
 what the galleries have in this case 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.650
 They are contributing their professionalism and their 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.190
 space the students their freshness their 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.190
 talent 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.190
 on the other hand also for example 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.260
 we were comparing what it means 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.300
 between acts with what can be a 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.670
 exhibition of the end of the course of a 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.070
 faculty that is usually like 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.320
 expose in a domestic space where 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 the same agents are the ones that go to 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.480
 be watching your work while this 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.460
 supposes a quite rigorous selection 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.140
 because it's been not only from the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.870
 team between acts but also by 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.600
 a professional jury and also a 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.670
 exposition of these students to all 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.940
 the profession with which the experience 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.890
 for them it is vital the more 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.440
 develop the project we realize 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.860
 of the importance it has for all 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.860
 those involved 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.620
 we face it as a project 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.870
 more than the gallery we did not want to do 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.420
 no kind of distinction but already in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 the previous interviews with 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.980
 commissioners or with the artists we gave him 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.930
 the focus of being an exhibition more than 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.459
 the gallery a little exposure 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.140
 atypical because it was going to last only one day 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.600
 because we would have to live with each other 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.010
 disassemble an installation that was the one 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.860
 We had until Saturday 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.379
 mount the installation in this case in the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.379
 ours with two different artists 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.620
 my proposal for intermission is a 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.680
 installation that occupies everything of the gallery 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.400
 inviting the viewer to take a walk 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.190
 for the place and participate in a 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.710
 ordered chaos what 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.409
 with what or dislodge the space in 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.040
 greater or lesser extent 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.010
 two 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.629
 It is very good that we can know how 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.560
 it works a bit from within this 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.560
 little world too 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.750
 Thank you 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.209
 my proposal to deliver three regions 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.209
 metamorphic is a project that has 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.310
 as an end reflect on our place 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.620
 within the spaces and good through 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.870
 of the case study of architecture 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.689
 Egyptian funeral home raised a 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.969
 scenography that simulated a montage that 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.950
 is equivalent to that part that within 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:58.969
 that reorganization of the spaces is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.260
 hides from people the call between 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.469
 act has been nothing very good opportunity 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.299
 to teach my work is a moment 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.600
 that has a very short temporality 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.480
 but 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.830
 by movement and dissemination that 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.290
 he has given him then he hopes that he has come 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.980
 a lot of people and I think so much for the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.690
 galleries as per the police station that to 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.370
 emilia that has led the organization and 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.760
 for the foundation of banco santander that 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.930
 supports the project financially as the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.250
 truth is that it has been an opportunity 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.000
 very good and from which I am very 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.000
 grateful 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.250
 My name is Marina, my project is 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.990
 llama building ideas is a project 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.590
 participatory in which I want the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.620
 People take part prior to intermission 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:54.340
 as the last act in my final project 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:58.000
 of career / act is an opportunity 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.270
 so that students or alumni of 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.580
 Masters and career of fine arts 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.129
 open to the outside world and have the 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.499
 opportunity 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.909
 to do things outside and not stay in the 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.909
 bubble that the university supposes 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.750
 two 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.239
 it is also encouraging to cultivate 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:28.699
 arts and fiction to go to the galleries 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:31.689
 as part of the promotion of collecting 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.689
 and the arts in general
