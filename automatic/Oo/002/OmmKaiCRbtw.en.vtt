 Fender 's Autumn Thank you very much 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.200
 Right 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 Also I'd have north out that Mustang 1 before 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:40.360
 It actually can make a lot of sound to play at home 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.470
 Yeah It'll Seibu was best for the healing force Nde yard effector has also been built 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.710
 I became that age. What changed I would say that first 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.710
 Yes was Tei has increased the coverage of the modeling of the amplifier 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.630
 Booboo a bit early 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:12.920
 It is a bubble or ah disappears and it disappears. 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.200
 I'm out on this screen, but I'm going to go with the computer and the screen 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.870
 So I know what kind of amp I'm using, I went to the story, I'm going now 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.760
 Is a deluxe club but 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.000
 Ball nice 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.659
 I now Winry Brown free d park it 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.340
 ac you 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:37.280
 And for example 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 Please and this where it falls into this monk is falling Xerox 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.600
 I wonder if that is so fine, this is true 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.429
 I feel like that this had been well preamplifier synchronizes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.659
 I think I have a also enters almost Well also Gow of such fender system 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.770
 + Post-effectors that it is the effector 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.080
 For example 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.800
 Yeah I think that phase difficult to see and go in stomp box 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.009
 Mr. Ushida has changed slightly 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.960
 Oh uh, what the display of that effector looks like a 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.520
 Yes on the screen 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.840
 Now I can see the green box at the time of the free box at the time of the high grip car 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.890
 It's a favorite car Screamer 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.800
 It's amazing. 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:31.319
 In this time now that practice Dror messing with security now is to go to action computer to the square 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.250
 If you connect it you can control both but this is a fan house 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.390
 It is chorus to motivation, and there is a row of ah ah ah 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 It should be noted that one where the order also finish I think you can change Yes after 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.370
 Wintering 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:50.140
 Yes delay Toka reverb is placed in front from the gas 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.310
 You can choose to put behind that as send return 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.580
 Well 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:01.140
 With a certain behind when that Anon his that delay like is not needed because it was Tanemame 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.260
