00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.420
 employees of course in a relative 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 small country then that is possible 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.110
 we have market research 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.840
 by a reputable company 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.209

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.819
 You see we have about a 4 million 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.849

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.629

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.329
 traffic 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.010

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.940
 small part 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.190
 Surinamese market but Suriname has the 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.230
 small 450,000 inhabitants 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.299
 the companies are therefore also less none 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.310

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.530
 Suriname falls under the European branch 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.010
 because we serve the Dutch market 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.579
