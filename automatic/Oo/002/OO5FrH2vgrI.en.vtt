buggy bumper and filter of course and it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.859 
buggy bumper and filter of course and it
goes<00:00:16.369> right<00:00:16.640> in<00:00:16.759> that<00:00:16.910> hole<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.300> right<00:00:17.689> down

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
goes right in that hole and right down

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.470 
goes right in that hole and right down
there<00:00:18.109> there's<00:00:18.560> two<00:00:18.650> hook<00:00:19.099> ups<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:19.580> this<00:00:20.359> is

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
there there's two hook ups and this is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.769 
there there's two hook ups and this is
important<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:20.929> note<00:00:21.169> that<00:00:22.029> as<00:00:23.029> complicated<00:00:23.449> as

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
important to note that as complicated as

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.509 
important to note that as complicated as
this<00:00:23.990> might<00:00:24.259> seem<00:00:24.560> in<00:00:24.830> fact<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.339> quite

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
this might seem in fact it's quite

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.700 
this might seem in fact it's quite
simple<00:00:25.910> because<00:00:26.509> there's<00:00:26.900> two<00:00:27.109> places<00:00:27.289> this

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
simple because there's two places this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.429 
simple because there's two places this
hooks<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.579> top<00:00:28.910> one<00:00:29.179> coming<00:00:29.539> down<00:00:29.720> is<00:00:30.109> the

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
hooks that top one coming down is the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.619 
hooks that top one coming down is the
vent<00:00:30.619> hose<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.970> one<00:00:32.119> down<00:00:32.329> there<00:00:32.509> on<00:00:32.599> the

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
vent hose and the one down there on the

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.760 
vent hose and the one down there on the
bottom<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.820> feed<00:00:35.180> for<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.140> injector<00:00:36.739> rail

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
bottom is the feed for the injector rail

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.490 
bottom is the feed for the injector rail
which<00:00:37.699> is<00:00:37.730> where<00:00:38.149> we<00:00:38.539> hook<00:00:39.219> this<00:00:40.219> guy<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.500> it's

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
which is where we hook this guy and it's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.139 
which is where we hook this guy and it's
really<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.890> simple<00:00:43.070> after<00:00:43.789> all<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:44.030> this

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
really that simple after all of this

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.740 
really that simple after all of this
mayhem<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.649> cleaning<00:00:46.640> up<00:00:46.760> debris<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.269> so<00:00:47.539> on

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
mayhem and cleaning up debris and so on

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.439 
mayhem and cleaning up debris and so on
you<00:00:48.500> will<00:00:48.769> see<00:00:49.039> some<00:00:49.309> lacquer<00:00:49.609> on<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.030> bottom

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
you will see some lacquer on the bottom

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.349 
you will see some lacquer on the bottom
we<00:00:50.629> did<00:00:50.809> work<00:00:51.019> on<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.410> bit<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.640> hard

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
we did work on that a bit and it's hard

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.619 
we did work on that a bit and it's hard
as<00:00:53.510> nails<00:00:53.539> in<00:00:54.079> there<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:54.760> my<00:00:55.760> expectation<00:00:56.510> is

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
as nails in there so my expectation is

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.060 
as nails in there so my expectation is
that<00:00:56.840> that's<00:00:56.989> not<00:00:57.440> going<00:00:57.679> to<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.890> able<00:00:57.949> to

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
that that's not going to be able to

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.369 
that that's not going to be able to
issue<00:00:58.250> for<00:00:58.609> us<00:01:00.100> outside<00:01:01.809> if<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:03.050> chose<00:01:03.320> to

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
issue for us outside if we chose to

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.370 
issue for us outside if we chose to
spend<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.070> month<00:01:04.430> cleaning<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.030> out<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:05.960> may

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
spend a month cleaning it out now I may

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320 
spend a month cleaning it out now I may
decide<00:01:06.740> before<00:01:07.160> this<00:01:07.340> whole<00:01:07.520> project<00:01:07.910> is<00:01:08.060> over

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
decide before this whole project is over

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.420 
decide before this whole project is over
to<00:01:08.510> get<00:01:08.630> back<00:01:08.840> in<00:01:09.020> there<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.440> just<00:01:09.590> clean<00:01:10.310> it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
to get back in there and just clean it

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.520 
to get back in there and just clean it
anyway<00:01:10.760> but<00:01:11.150> for<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.260> trying<00:01:12.410> to

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
anyway but for now we're trying to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.240 
anyway but for now we're trying to
deduce<00:01:13.210> whether<00:01:14.210> or<00:01:14.420> not<00:01:14.600> our<00:01:14.900> pump<00:01:15.830> was<00:01:16.070> the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
deduce whether or not our pump was the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.910 
deduce whether or not our pump was the
problem<00:01:16.670> for<00:01:16.820> our<00:01:17.120> gas<00:01:17.630> tank<00:01:17.900> was<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.140> issue

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
problem for our gas tank was the issue

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.440 
problem for our gas tank was the issue
stopping<00:01:19.700> function<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:22.000> engine<00:01:23.000> so

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
stopping function of the engine so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.520 
stopping function of the engine so
that's<00:01:24.110> why<00:01:24.380> we're<00:01:25.720> moving<00:01:26.720> forward<00:01:27.110> we<00:01:27.350> did

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
that's why we're moving forward we did

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.710 
that's why we're moving forward we did
clear<00:01:27.800> every<00:01:28.160> last<00:01:28.550> bit<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.910> debris<00:01:29.150> there

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
clear every last bit of debris there

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.920 
clear every last bit of debris there
were<00:01:30.040> probably<00:01:31.040> two<00:01:31.640> tablespoons<00:01:32.390> worth<00:01:32.690> of

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
were probably two tablespoons worth of

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.460 
were probably two tablespoons worth of
pieces<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.540> garbage<00:01:35.540> down<00:01:35.870> in<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.140> bottom

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
pieces of garbage down in the bottom

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.930 
pieces of garbage down in the bottom
which<00:01:36.620> was<00:01:36.740> probably<00:01:37.010> causing<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.580> lot<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.760> the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
which was probably causing a lot of the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.450 
which was probably causing a lot of the
clogs<00:01:38.180> inside<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.560> now<00:01:40.130> we're<00:01:40.310> going<00:01:40.400> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
clogs inside so now we're going to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.080 
clogs inside so now we're going to
install<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.860> my<00:01:42.860> venerable<00:01:43.130> friend<00:01:43.700> here

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
install and my venerable friend here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.240 
install and my venerable friend here
we're<00:01:44.630> gonna<00:01:44.960> pop<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:45.800> baby<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
we're gonna pop that baby in there so

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.850 
we're gonna pop that baby in there so
here<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.370> see<00:01:49.610> going<00:01:50.120> in

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
here we see going in

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.530 
here we see going in
sorry<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.580> can<00:01:52.730> show<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.940> more<00:01:53.210> because

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
sorry you can show you more because

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.510 
sorry you can show you more because
there's<00:01:53.990> no<00:01:54.200> way<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.760> do<00:01:55.760> that<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:57.370> wish<00:01:58.370> I

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
there's no way to do that in this wish I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.250 
there's no way to do that in this wish I
had<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> little<00:01:58.730> CCD<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.630> fit<00:01:59.810> in<00:01:59.930> there<00:02:00.080> a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
had a little CCD I can fit in there a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.230 
had a little CCD I can fit in there a
tight<00:02:00.530> fit<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.670> tight<00:02:01.910> fit

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.220 

they'll<00:02:07.900> cook<00:02:08.200> right<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.619> there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.570 

turn<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.340> music<00:02:14.550> down<00:02:14.760> aways<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.239> go

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.190 

so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.670> anyone<00:02:24.000> was<00:02:24.209> intimidated<00:02:24.989> by<00:02:25.140> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so if anyone was intimidated by this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 
so if anyone was intimidated by this
process<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.129> beginning<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.090> answer

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
process at the beginning the the answer

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.390 
process at the beginning the the answer
is<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> truly<00:02:28.530> it's<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.069> complicated

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
is that truly it's not that complicated

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.759 
is that truly it's not that complicated
there<00:02:30.390> seems<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.930> there's<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.680> on

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
there seems like there's a lot going on
