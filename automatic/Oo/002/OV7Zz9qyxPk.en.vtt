00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
capture the spirit of the characters and

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.860 
capture the spirit of the characters and
and<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.030> Milne<00:03:48.270> had<00:03:48.540> written<00:03:48.720> about

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
and the way that Milne had written about

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.540 
and the way that Milne had written about
him<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.230> very<00:03:49.320> close<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.770> that<00:03:50.010> spirit<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
him it's very close to that spirit and

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.670 
him it's very close to that spirit and
some<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.450> yet<00:03:51.630> they<00:03:51.750> somehow<00:03:51.959> manage<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.380> make

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
some but yet they somehow manage to make

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
some but yet they somehow manage to make
the<00:03:53.280> humor<00:03:53.640> really<00:03:53.970> sharp<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.800> very<00:03:55.800> funny

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130
