00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
think it is that that the amount of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
think it is that that the amount of
experience<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.620> yeah<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.910> film<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
experience that yeah as in film in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.700 
experience that yeah as in film in
filmmaking<00:01:05.299> for<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.630> an<00:01:06.750> education<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
filmmaking for me it is an education to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
filmmaking for me it is an education to
understand<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.340> systems<00:01:08.790> work<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.869> we

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
understand how systems work because we

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
understand how systems work because we
re<00:01:10.260> propping<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.920> industry<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
re propping our industry and I think it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.590 
re propping our industry and I think it
would<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> valuable<00:01:13.320> contribution<00:01:14.479> be<00:01:15.479> at

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
would be a valuable contribution be at

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
would be a valuable contribution be at
india<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.920> any<00:01:17.070> part<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> world

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
india or be at any part of the world

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
india or be at any part of the world
where<00:01:18.380> films<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> trend<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.780> i<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:22.110> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
where films are a trend and i think it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
where films are a trend and i think it's
so<00:01:22.470> convenient<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.340> neighboring<00:01:23.939> country

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
so convenient that a neighboring country

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.880 
so convenient that a neighboring country
