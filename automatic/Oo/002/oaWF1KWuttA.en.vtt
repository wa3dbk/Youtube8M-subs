00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
too hard when you pull it out it could

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.440

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
here now this kit is fully painted but I

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.350 
here now this kit is fully painted but I
didn't<00:04:09.379> fully<00:04:09.500> detail<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.159> so<00:04:10.459> like<00:04:10.640> like<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
didn't fully detail it so like like the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.670 
didn't fully detail it so like like the
thrusters<00:04:11.720> should<00:04:11.959> have<00:04:12.110> some<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> little<00:04:12.590> more

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
thrusters should have some a little more

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.619 
thrusters should have some a little more
color<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.069> them<00:04:13.159> I<00:04:13.370> depend<00:04:14.209> on<00:04:14.269> line<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.450> little

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
color in them I depend on line a little

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.310 
color in them I depend on line a little
bit<00:04:15.820> but<00:04:16.820> not<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.090> whole<00:04:17.329> lot<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:21.109> is<00:04:21.169> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
bit but not a whole lot this is a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.800 
bit but not a whole lot this is a
sticker<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.389> little<00:04:23.389> part<00:04:23.539> up<00:04:23.600> there's<00:04:23.750> a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
sticker that little part up there's a

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.260 
sticker that little part up there's a
sticker

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.920 

all<00:04:30.810> right

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.689 

so<00:04:33.440> yeah<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.710> guess<00:04:34.009> that's<00:04:34.190> pretty<00:04:34.310> much<00:04:34.430> it

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
so yeah I guess that's pretty much it

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.710 
so yeah I guess that's pretty much it
about<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.780> five<00:04:35.930> minute<00:04:36.199> mark<00:04:37.600> thanks<00:04:38.600> for
