00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi guys I am here today to talk 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.240
 of these wet wipes and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.860
 colors they are enamel removers and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.250
 I did a quick review for you. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 how they work 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.869
 I did not know the pink enamel is more or 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.660
 less a week he requested autopsy 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 New Year 's Eve 221 already made drawings of him in the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 Blog this enamel however here picking up 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 in 5 you can see it is very thin 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 has a certain transparency and I go 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 so it's first take out of the thumb that he 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.219
 It's already a little bit of the tourists in a little bit. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.050
 faster 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 I like to take the moves 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.170
 rotary and bills can see left 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.079
 practically 100% of the enamel or broke 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 finger will use the same teaching and also 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:09.390
 with the rotating movements 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:17.400
 I'll be rubbing drive is already 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 totally without enamel such as this law 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 5 only one and yes I did remove the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 two nail polish 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.880
 I'll get then again and then I will take the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880
 remaining of the nails 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.140
 ignore the reflection of the table 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.310
 no one in the mines which you can see the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.230
 image has improved a bit I continue 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 with the same movements and with the tip 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.550
 I even took the nail and it was 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.870
 handing one corner to take 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.940
 the rest of the enamel continued 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.580
 Taking away, you've seen what happened. 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 holley yes all dirty and I go 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.360
 continuing to pull all enamel as 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.459
 You can see then I've taken all the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 enamel in seconds 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.310
 I used three or bells to get out of hand 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:34.110
 of the five lines is super easy 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.580
 How fast I'm taking this new 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.280
 to tell you what the proposal of the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.220
 brand are neither expected and down 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.320
 totally free of acetone ie 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.510
 strip your enamel without bad planning 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.870
 What is a very good thing is a 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.390
 collection with six is different fruit that 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.720
 that I'm using is strawberry but it tends 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.720
 lemon strawberry grape peach whole melon 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.880
 obviously as it is acetone free 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.220
 it does not smell strong, it's just not 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 even the smell of the frutinha and it is nothing 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.890
 too strong too much is too much 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.680
 soft and that does not bother I already bought 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.299
 the other the other fruits way not 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.190
 arrived as soon as you arrive after a post in 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.400
 blog but I came here today to show 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.590
 For you it 's about wonderful productive. 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.420
 damaging your nails that takes 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.420
 super fast without making a mess 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.350
 it even has a little aspect you ozu 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.750
 which is cool that already gives a hydrated in the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:43.120
 cuticles well 32 or bells in a pot 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.850
 very compact as you can see in 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.790
 a few minutes I took the nail polish 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.110
 of all the nails and something very cool that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.480
 does not collect the people in your 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.110
 back and strips on like no other 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.800
 he is then fully approved this 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.990
 was the price rise of certain lla 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.990
 colors a kiss for you and bye, bye
