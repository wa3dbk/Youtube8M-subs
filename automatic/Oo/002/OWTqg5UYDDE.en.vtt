00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.230
 service provided here at the port of santos 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.710
 will retire in the place comes the new 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.440
 generation modern trucks this euro5 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 story, people tell us now, these are 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.750
 have 30 to 40 years of service 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 provided in the transfer of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.119
 containers in the port of Santos are 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.939
 quite used and some highly judged 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.130
 but are still in the running are 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.130
 true heroes of resistance 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.780
 but the lifespan of these trucks is 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.580
 getting to the end 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.340
 one of the criteria of the program is that 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.280
 old truck to be replaced by the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.350
 new will have to be recycled will give 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.170
 low and turn scrap 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.720
 this one for example logo logo was already the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.300
 replacement of old cars by vehicle 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.580
 zero-kilometer is part of the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.840
 incentive to renew the fleet of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.150
 trucks 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 the initiative is the government of the state of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.670
 São Paulo through the development sp 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.800
 development agency paulista 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.330
 the first ten trucks were 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.970
 delivered by the state governor 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.369
 geraldo alckmin in san sebastian on your 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.920
 I gave the key to the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.509
 truck said that his truck had 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 53 years old 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.750
 people have great difficulty in 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.820
 renew the fleet 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.680
 then this program we are 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.800
 Agency placing develops are 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.920
 paulo 270 million reais 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.009
 you can buy a thousand trucks at 270 thousand 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.610
 the horse and 30 million 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.830
 treasure pleasure to interest and commitment 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.160
 that old truck comes out of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.190
 circulation it goes to recycling it 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.869
 is to not pollute and to preserve the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.300
 environment then wins win 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.910
 the trucker with more security 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.179
 new vehicle improving your lace 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.810
 earning is your best wedge bread with 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.720
 new technology to comfort the economy of 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.620
 the country flowing better and preserving 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.540
 environment 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.330
 The program has the support of the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.410
 truckers union saints rate zero 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.750
 this is very important the trucker 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.599
 very important is very important 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.760
 because the truck driver had already won alfred 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.620
 are very low so we have a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.270
 interest rate zero hour is gets much 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.180
 feasibility of the program the interest rate 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 zero is for those who pay the installment on time 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.830
 currently was a scania alligator 75 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.750
 helinho apartments already né no 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.800
 Wellington was the same age as the 75 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.340
 and is still in shape 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.740
 Are you sure you can inform the truck? 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.980
 The plane was not asking for it yet. 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.250
 Zero rate, this is good for you. It's great. 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.620
 people only pay interest in this life - cent 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.250
 beyond this interest rate advantage 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.460
 the financing in 96 months 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.610
 and the first entry has provision only 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.130
 after six months father business to 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.930
 son that says anyone who has received the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.760
 new way is very much joy 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.190
 victory in our life is receiving 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.720
 this is the new way to work 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.310
 when we get home to hit 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 to stay with the family is not there 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.460
 workshop tidying up an old truck is 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.740
 victory 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.180
 old trucks are more polluting and 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.400
 give a lot of workshop to spend on average 6 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.130
 half of the salary half way and half 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.900
 this path also to expenditure and 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.660
 now with the truck will be given attention 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.120
 will stop the expense now just said 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.510
 pro solo work the program is pilot or 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 Whether it's protesting, it's okay. 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.239
 extended 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.150
 this first stage should be 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.000
 replaced a thousand old trucks of the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.600
 about 6 thousand that circulate in the port of 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.830
 saints 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.630
 the idea is that this program be 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.670
 been gradually expanded so that we 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.770
 we can renew the fleet of trucks 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.720
 is in São Paulo that really has the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.520
 very advanced middle age was 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.470
 the sectors that can benefit 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.180
 for this program has several sectors 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.230
 which today carries the position in the state 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.150
 all 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.070
 we have sectors such as the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.530
 area that carry daily cargo of 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.840
 sugar cane where you have trucks 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.820
 very old people carrying sugarcane 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.010
 sugar and causing the accident because the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.570
 trucks break every moment then 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.490
 this can also be a step towards 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.090
 front to do to participate in the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.610
 program 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.320
 in this program we made an agreement 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.210
 with the truck drivers union 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.060
 port and santi and that the union 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.530
 non- receiving assistance and screening of 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.480
 documentation of truck drivers so that 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.680
 then be forwarded to the agency 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.930
 development of São Paulo 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.080
 in this first moment the project reaches 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.990
 10 to 20 trucks but the expectation is 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.690
 replace up to 1,000 is the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.720
 fellow who is one of quetta in the queue is 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.210
 You'll replace that old chevrolet. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.250
 for a younger truck are you 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.490
 the queue sure as there in the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.270
 expectation of soon there is a 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.639
 new truck is improving there before 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.120
 work life expectancy of all 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.389
 huh 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.569
 everything I know better then you can 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.050
 happen and we there my a new is good 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.150
 Neither does it look like urban legend 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.419
 but it is not that the program of renewal of 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.910
 fleet starts to exist in Brazil and begins 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.120
 by the port of santos you miss me 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.099
 the old scanner does not rethink 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.099
 I will not miss you, will not you?
