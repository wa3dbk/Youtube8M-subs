since mine is copper it it kind of looks

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
since mine is copper it it kind of looks
copper<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:32.539> there<00:01:32.719> I<00:01:32.749> don't<00:01:32.929> know<00:01:33.079> if<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.259> guys

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
copper in there I don't know if you guys

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.980 
copper in there I don't know if you guys
can<00:01:33.439> tell<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:33.950> or<00:01:34.069> not<00:01:34.219> but<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.689> what

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
can tell that or not but this is what

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.709 
can tell that or not but this is what
the<00:01:36.109> wand<00:01:36.350> looks<00:01:36.770> like<00:01:37.039> it's<00:01:37.340> got<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.969> kind<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.569> a

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
the wand looks like it's got a kind of a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.219 
the wand looks like it's got a kind of a
ball<00:01:39.219> point<00:01:40.219> to<00:01:40.639> it<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:40.939> then<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.389> downed<00:01:41.810> wand

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
ball point to it and then on downed wand

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.709 
ball point to it and then on downed wand
or<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.069> brush<00:01:43.279> it<00:01:43.639> gets<00:01:43.819> smaller<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:44.539> that's

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
or the brush it gets smaller so that's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.679 
or the brush it gets smaller so that's
what<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.899> looks<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:45.639> the<00:01:46.639> formula<00:01:47.359> of<00:01:47.630> the

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
what that looks like the formula of the

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.300 
what that looks like the formula of the
illuminator<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:49.039> a<00:01:49.459> little<00:01:50.029> thinner<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.310> its

really<00:01:53.139> copper<00:01:54.139> looking<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.069> it<00:01:55.310> has<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.819> lot

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
really copper looking and it has a lot

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.659 
really copper looking and it has a lot
of<00:01:56.329> glitter<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.169> there<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.159> that's<00:01:58.459> what<00:01:58.639> that

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:58.669 
of glitter in there so that's what that

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.699 
of glitter in there so that's what that
looks<00:01:59.029> like<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.139> basically<00:02:00.469> what<00:02:00.679> you're

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
looks like so basically what you're

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.769 
looks like so basically what you're
supposed<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.159> do<00:02:01.310> fit<00:02:01.729> with<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.389> you're

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.219 
supposed to use step 1 the mascara and
then<00:02:04.909> right<00:02:05.090> after<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.450> you're<00:02:05.779> supposed<00:02:06.079> to

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
then right after that you're supposed to

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.559 
then right after that you're supposed to
use<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.590> illuminator<00:02:07.130> I've<00:02:08.030> used<00:02:08.270> this

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
use the illuminator I've used this

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.110 
use the illuminator I've used this
several<00:02:09.050> different<00:02:09.440> ways<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.979> tried<00:02:10.459> doing<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
several different ways I tried doing the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
several different ways I tried doing the
mascara<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.840> making<00:02:12.170> sure<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> get

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
mascara and making sure you know I get

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.120 
mascara and making sure you know I get
each<00:02:13.580> lash<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:14.930> did<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> illuminator

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
each lash and then I did the illuminator

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.370 
each lash and then I did the illuminator
and<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:17.060> find<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.570> if<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.870> wait<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and I really find that if you wait a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.900 
and I really find that if you wait a
couple

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
couple

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.710 
couple
it's<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:21.130> mascara<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.940> course<00:02:22.510> it's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
it's on the the mascara of course it's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.960 
it's on the the mascara of course it's
going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.110> dry<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.130> kind<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.430> hard<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.790> get

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
going to dry so it's kind of hard to get

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.450 
going to dry so it's kind of hard to get
the<00:02:25.120> illuminator<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.900> there<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.310> find

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
the illuminator on there I really find

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.060 
the illuminator on there I really find
that<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.850> mascara<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.630> really<00:02:29.410> quick<00:02:29.650> drying

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
that the mascara is really quick drying

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.440 
that the mascara is really quick drying
so<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:30.580> kind<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.060> work<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.420> little

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
so you kind of have to work a little

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.950 
so you kind of have to work a little
fast<00:02:31.870> with<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:33.220> try<00:02:33.700> doing<00:02:34.090> two<00:02:34.480> coats<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
fast with it I try doing two coats of

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.720 
fast with it I try doing two coats of
the<00:02:35.050> mascara<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.190> coat<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.490> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the mascara and one coat of the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090 
the mascara and one coat of the
illuminator<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.930> looks<00:02:38.200> horrendous<00:02:38.530> it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
illuminator and that looks horrendous it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.460 
illuminator and that looks horrendous it
did<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.370> look<00:02:39.700> good<00:02:39.760> at<00:02:39.940> all<00:02:40.300> make<00:02:41.050> my<00:02:41.200> lashes

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
did not look good at all make my lashes

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.730 
did not look good at all make my lashes
look<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.190> spider<00:02:42.580> legs<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.300> my<00:02:44.080> lashes<00:02:44.350> were

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
look like spider legs and my lashes were

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.530 
look like spider legs and my lashes were
like<00:02:44.920> stuck<00:02:45.340> together<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.090> bit<00:02:46.330> or

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
like stuck together a little bit or

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.510 
like stuck together a little bit or
getting<00:02:46.990> stuck<00:02:47.350> together<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.190> didn't<00:02:48.430> look

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
getting stuck together so it didn't look

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.900 
getting stuck together so it didn't look
good<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:50.140> also<00:02:50.440> tried<00:02:50.890> doing<00:02:51.190> one<00:02:51.670> coat<00:02:51.880> of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
good and I also tried doing one coat of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.240 
good and I also tried doing one coat of
mascara<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.840> two<00:02:53.170> coats<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> illuminator

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
mascara and two coats of the illuminator

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.080 
mascara and two coats of the illuminator
and<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:55.510> seemed<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.930> work<00:02:56.070> best<00:02:57.070> overall<00:02:57.730> for

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
and that seemed to work best overall for

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.810 
and that seemed to work best overall for
me<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:58.960> really<00:02:59.770> got<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.070> lot<00:03:00.490> of<00:03:00.520> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
me and that really got a lot of the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.400 
me and that really got a lot of the
illuminator<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.830> as<00:03:03.610> far<00:03:03.910> as

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
illuminator on there so as far as

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.960 
illuminator on there so as far as
brightening<00:03:05.410> your<00:03:05.440> eyes<00:03:05.790> illuminating<00:03:06.790> your

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
brightening your eyes illuminating your

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.210 
brightening your eyes illuminating your
eyes<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.660> definitely<00:03:08.080> did<00:03:08.380> not<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.950> for

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
eyes it definitely did not do that for

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.400 
eyes it definitely did not do that for
me<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.790> did<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.030> make<00:03:10.360> my<00:03:10.510> eyes<00:03:10.780> look<00:03:10.810> brighter

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
me it did not make my eyes look brighter

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.130 
me it did not make my eyes look brighter
at<00:03:11.770> all<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.420> disappointed<00:03:14.020> about

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
at all and kind of disappointed about

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
at all and kind of disappointed about
that<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:16.000> far<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.780> being<00:03:17.080> able<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.590> see<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:17.980> on

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
that as far as being able to see this on

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.010 
that as far as being able to see this on
your<00:03:18.280> lashes<00:03:18.430> if<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.030> get<00:03:19.210> right<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.720> into<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
your lashes if you get right up into the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.020 
your lashes if you get right up into the
mirror<00:03:20.410> or<00:03:20.710> you're<00:03:20.740> in<00:03:21.160> somewhere<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.850> has

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
mirror or you're in somewhere that has

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.030 
mirror or you're in somewhere that has
tons<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.600> lights<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.650> see<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.010> pretty

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
tons of lights you can see it pretty

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.449 
tons of lights you can see it pretty
well<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.810> know<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.170> if<00:03:26.440> you're<00:03:26.740> just<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.250> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
well but you know if if you're just in a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.640 
well but you know if if you're just in a
room<00:03:28.150> or<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.780> don't<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.110> lot<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.350> light<00:03:29.620> on

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
room or you don't have a lot of light on

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.360 
room or you don't have a lot of light on
you<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.730> kind<00:03:31.000> of<00:03:31.090> hard<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.420> see<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.890> really

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
you it's kind of hard to see so I really

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.370 
you it's kind of hard to see so I really
don't<00:03:33.580> think<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.240> mascara<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:34.900> really

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
don't think that this mascara is really

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.970 
don't think that this mascara is really
worth<00:03:35.590> ten<00:03:35.980> dollars<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> think<00:03:36.760> ten<00:03:37.000> dollars<00:03:37.450> is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
worth ten dollars I think ten dollars is

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.400 
worth ten dollars I think ten dollars is
really<00:03:38.980> overpriced<00:03:39.490> for<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.180> product<00:03:40.480> being

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
really overpriced for this product being

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.320 
really overpriced for this product being
that<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.830> didn't<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:42.280> think<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.730> works<00:03:43.030> I

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
that I didn't really think it works I

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.560 
that I didn't really think it works I
mean<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.020> all<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.590> on<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> skel<00:03:45.700> 125<00:03:46.540> i

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
mean it's all right on a skel 125 i

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.620 
mean it's all right on a skel 125 i
would<00:03:47.110> probably<00:03:47.500> rate<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.700> one<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
would probably rate this like a one and

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.260 
would probably rate this like a one and
a<00:03:49.720> half<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:51.190> because<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.640> didn't<00:03:51.940> make<00:03:52.150> my

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
a half just because it didn't make my

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.880 
a half just because it didn't make my
eyes<00:03:52.480> look<00:03:52.510> brighter<00:03:53.020> it<00:03:53.380> wasn't<00:03:53.739> very

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
eyes look brighter it wasn't very

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.540 
eyes look brighter it wasn't very
