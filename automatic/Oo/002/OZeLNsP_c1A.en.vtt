actually do up the bag open up the bag
like<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.610> then<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> pump<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:37.070> then<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> spin

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
like this then you pump it then you spin

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
like this then you pump it then you spin
it<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:40.579> get<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> couple<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.000> Leslie<00:00:42.360> pins<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it you get a couple of Leslie pins to it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
it you get a couple of Leslie pins to it
three<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.710> over<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.460> cross

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
three then you put that over and cross

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
three then you put that over and cross
it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.260 
it
and<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.310> double<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> over<00:00:51.740> and<00:00:52.740> you<00:00:52.920> loop<00:00:53.270> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and you double it over and you loop the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.590 
and you double it over and you loop the
elastic<00:00:54.810> bands<00:00:55.280> over<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.580> top<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.240> then

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
elastic bands over the top and then

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160 
elastic bands over the top and then
you've<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.900> perfectly<00:00:58.500> packed<00:00:58.770> spit<00:00:59.600> now<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you've got perfectly packed spit now the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.530 
you've got perfectly packed spit now the
way<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.740> packed<00:01:02.040> is<00:01:02.610> very<00:01:02.910> convenient

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
way this is packed is very convenient

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.329 
way this is packed is very convenient
because<00:01:03.630> when<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> home<00:01:04.440> instead<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
because when you get home instead of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.490 
because when you get home instead of
wrestling<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> elastic<00:01:06.630> band<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
wrestling with that elastic band and you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.680 
wrestling with that elastic band and you
can<00:01:07.740> put<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.160> fish<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.550> tank<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.540> just

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
can put your fish in the tank you just

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.460 
can put your fish in the tank you just
go<00:01:09.780> cool<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.190> comes<00:01:11.430> straight<00:01:11.790> off

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
go cool and then it comes straight off

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.300 
go cool and then it comes straight off
now<00:01:13.470> once<00:01:13.680> again<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:16.310> open

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
now once again the way you do it open

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.230 
now once again the way you do it open
the<00:01:17.400> bag<00:01:17.550> up<00:01:18.050> cuff<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:21.229> twist<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:23.119> cross<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
the bag up cuff it twist it cross it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.440 
the bag up cuff it twist it cross it
mm<00:01:26.700> movement<00:01:28.110> sub<00:01:29.110> sent<00:01:29.350> an<00:01:29.470> advance<00:01:29.560> move<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
mm movement sub sent an advance move and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.480 
mm movement sub sent an advance move and
become<00:01:31.780> yeah<00:01:32.649> this<00:01:32.950> piece<00:01:33.100> are<00:01:33.220> going<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.399> be

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
become yeah this piece are going to be

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.889 
become yeah this piece are going to be
traveling<00:01:33.729> for<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.180> longer<00:01:34.450> period<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.840> time

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
traveling for a longer period of time

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.679 
traveling for a longer period of time
like<00:01:35.290> 24<00:01:35.740> hours<00:01:36.100> or<00:01:36.250> something<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.479> want<00:01:37.570> to

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
like 24 hours or something you want to

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.380 
like 24 hours or something you want to
add<00:01:37.810> some<00:01:38.020> oxygen<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.549> then<00:01:39.700> what<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.939> do<00:01:40.090> is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
add some oxygen so then what you do is

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.890 
add some oxygen so then what you do is
pop<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:44.140> your<00:01:44.259> oxygen

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
pop it get your oxygen

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.810 
pop it get your oxygen
and<00:01:46.410> that's<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.010> oxygen<00:01:49.280> twisting

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.160 

across<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
across it

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.890 
across it
double<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.299> lose<00:01:58.299> it

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
double it lose it

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.230 
double it lose it
yeah<00:02:00.470> we've<00:02:00.680> got<00:02:00.890> plenty<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.340> oxygen<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.120> a

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
yeah we've got plenty of oxygen and a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.360 
yeah we've got plenty of oxygen and a
little<00:02:02.480> bit<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.660> water<00:02:02.840> because<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.860> oxygen

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
little bit of water because the oxygen

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.550 
little bit of water because the oxygen
was<00:02:04.490> put<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.820> under<00:02:05.030> pressure<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.930> oxygen

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
was put it under pressure the oxygen

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.290 
was put it under pressure the oxygen
will<00:02:06.710> force<00:02:07.010> its<00:02:07.220> way<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.850> water<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
will force its way to the water and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.270 
will force its way to the water and
saturate<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.960> oil<00:02:09.200> which<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.470> what<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:09.800> want

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
saturate the oil which is what we want

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.460 
saturate the oil which is what we want
now<00:02:11.210> if<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> fishes<00:02:11.780> are<00:02:11.870> going<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> go<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.410> a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
now if the fishes are going to go for a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.890 
now if the fishes are going to go for a
very<00:02:12.620> long<00:02:12.950> time

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
very long time

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.950 
very long time
that's<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.050> several<00:02:15.500> days<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:17.690> we're<00:02:17.840> going

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
that's in several days what we're going

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.060 
that's in several days what we're going
to<00:02:17.990> do<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.320> released<00:02:19.010> most<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.550> air<00:02:19.670> out

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
to do is released most of the air out

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.380 
to do is released most of the air out
one<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.190> oxygen

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.320 

this<00:02:25.390> piece<00:02:25.690> could<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:28.120> two<00:02:28.300> weeks

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
this piece could go for one to two weeks

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.860 
this piece could go for one to two weeks
and<00:02:29.080> I've<00:02:29.200> actually<00:02:29.379> tested<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:30.720> pin<00:02:31.720> there

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and I've actually tested that pin there

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.100 
and I've actually tested that pin there
how<00:02:31.989> many<00:02:32.050> fish<00:02:32.349> you've<00:02:32.530> got<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:34.110> once

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
how many fish you've got in it once

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.550 
how many fish you've got in it once
again<00:02:35.819> cross<00:02:36.819> it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.380 

and<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.190> how<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.370> go<00:02:43.550> over<00:02:43.730> back

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.680 

I<00:02:50.480> even<00:02:51.050> even<00:02:51.319> turn<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.560> off
