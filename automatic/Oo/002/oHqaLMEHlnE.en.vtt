00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thousandth of an inch so it goes and it

thousandth of an inch so it goes and it
lines<00:01:04.410> up<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.980> zero<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.030> barrel<00:01:06.450> so

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
lines up with the zero on the barrel so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.090

all<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.700> you'll<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.299> number<00:01:36.840> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
all the way out you'll see a number on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580 
all the way out you'll see a number on
that<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> says<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.270> indicates<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that it says one and that indicates that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.999 
that it says one and that indicates that
this<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.180> point<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.380> inch<00:01:43.680> for

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this right there a point one inch for

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.130 
this right there a point one inch for
that<00:01:44.159> gap<00:01:44.490> between<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.329> point<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.930> inch

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
that gap between there's point one inch

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.429 
that gap between there's point one inch
now<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> other<00:01:49.590> scale<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.509> barrel<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
now the other scale up up the barrel is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.240 
now the other scale up up the barrel is
for<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> ten<00:01:53.790> thousands<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.479> an<00:01:54.630> inch<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.250> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
for the ten thousands of an inch and the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
for the ten thousands of an inch and the
way<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.790> works<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
way that works is what you have a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.730 
way that works is what you have a
setting<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.119> read<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:01.200> number

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
setting you read which which number

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340 
setting you read which which number
across<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> zero<00:02:04.049> point

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
across here and it is at the zero point

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.359 
across here and it is at the zero point
so<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.119> 20<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.350> read<00:02:07.530> point<00:02:07.979> four

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
so this is 20 this would read point four

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.880 
so this is 20 this would read point four
nine

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.750 

eight<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:14.320> more<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.220> zero<00:02:15.730> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
eight and some more because this zero is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.580 
eight and some more because this zero is
past<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.620> pass<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.450> 0.49<00:02:19.450> eight<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
past the pass that so is 0.49 eight and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.100 
past the pass that so is 0.49 eight and
then<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.190> move<00:02:21.670> them<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.060> find<00:02:22.330> which<00:02:22.750> one<00:02:23.080> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
then I move them and find which one of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.230 
then I move them and find which one of
these<00:02:23.440> lines<00:02:23.800> line<00:02:24.310> up<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> best<00:02:24.910> which

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
these lines line up the best which

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.290 
these lines line up the best which
appears<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:27.000> four<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> read<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.470> as

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
appears to be a four so I read that as

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.510 
appears to be a four so I read that as
point<00:02:31.300> four<00:02:32.080> nine<00:02:33.210> eight<00:02:34.210> four<00:02:35.080> ten<00:02:35.980> thousands

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.449 
of an inch
most<00:02:37.720> people<00:02:38.140> go<00:02:38.260> maybe<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.830> ten<00:02:39.010> thousands

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
most people go maybe with ten thousands

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.510 
most people go maybe with ten thousands
of<00:02:39.550> an<00:02:39.670> inch<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:40.630> scale<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.800> there<00:02:42.160> so
