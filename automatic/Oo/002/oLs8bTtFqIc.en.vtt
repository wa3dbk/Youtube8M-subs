but starting off with the spot fading
toner<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.369> looks<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
but something about this that's really

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.569 
but something about this that's really
interesting<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.229> has<00:02:01.530> hydroquinone<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
interesting is it has hydroquinone and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
interesting is it has hydroquinone and
this<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> key<00:02:03.390> ingredient<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> find<00:02:04.469> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this is a key ingredient that I find in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 
this is a key ingredient that I find in
the<00:02:04.860> pharmacy<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> does<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the pharmacy and what it does is it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.469 
the pharmacy and what it does is it
lightens<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.890> skin<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.489> doesn't<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
lightens your skin it doesn't like in

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
lightens your skin it doesn't like in
and<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.840> bleach<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.470> skin<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> brings

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and like bleach your skin but it brings

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.730 
and like bleach your skin but it brings
it<00:02:11.580> back<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> its<00:02:12.120> natural<00:02:12.330> base<00:02:13.050> tone<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it back to its natural base tone to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.950 
it back to its natural base tone to
it's<00:02:13.890> naturalistic<00:02:14.670> ground<00:02:14.940> state<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's naturalistic ground state if that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.090 
it's naturalistic ground state if that
makes<00:02:16.320> sense<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> after<00:02:22.080> using<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.410> spot

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
makes sense so after using my spot

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.660 
makes sense so after using my spot

treatment<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.240> looks<00:02:30.420> like

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
treatment and this is what it looks like

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
treatment and this is what it looks like
it<00:02:31.800> does<00:02:31.980> have<00:02:32.220> benzoyl<00:02:32.610> peroxide<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.420> but

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it does have benzoyl peroxide in it but

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750 
it does have benzoyl peroxide in it but
it's<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> very<00:02:34.050> low<00:02:34.620> dose<00:02:35.010> compared<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it's a very low dose compared to what I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's a very low dose compared to what I
was<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:36.060> before<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.750> do<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:37.260> oily<00:02:37.620> skin<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
was using before I do have oily skin so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.090 
was using before I do have oily skin so
using<00:02:39.030> all<00:02:39.240> these<00:02:39.450> together<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:40.650> don't<00:02:40.800> tend

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
using all these together they don't tend

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.160 
using all these together they don't tend
to<00:02:41.220> dry<00:02:41.400> my<00:02:41.610> face<00:02:41.940> out<00:02:42.210> but<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.900> would

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
to dry my face out but if I do I would

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.830 
to dry my face out but if I do I would
just<00:02:43.320> use<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.710> an<00:02:43.830> SPF<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.580> lotion<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.780> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
just use like an SPF a lotion this is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.660 
just use like an SPF a lotion this is
what<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.170> looks<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.800> has<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.310> pump

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
what it looks like it has a little pump

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.970 
what it looks like it has a little pump
so<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.300> easy<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.720> dispense<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.770> nice

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so it's easy to dispense it's nice

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.180 
so it's easy to dispense it's nice
because<00:02:50.430> once<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.810> usually<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.710> one<00:02:52.950> pump

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
because once I usually just do one pump

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.400 
because once I usually just do one pump
but<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.910> or<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.090> pump<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.840> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
but you can do one or two pump and it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.010 
but you can do one or two pump and it
dispenses<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.610> an<00:02:56.730> even<00:02:57.090> amount<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.720> you're

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
dispenses it in an even amount so you're

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.570 
dispenses it in an even amount so you're
not<00:02:58.110> wasting<00:02:58.380> too<00:02:58.860> much<00:02:58.890> not<00:02:59.280> putting<00:02:59.550> too

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
not wasting too much not putting too

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.190 
not wasting too much not putting too
much<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.910> your<00:03:00.030> hand<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.600> too<00:03:00.750> little<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.110> your

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.530 
much on your hand or too little on your
hand<00:03:01.410> one<00:03:02.100> thing<00:03:02.310> about<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.820> line<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.360> that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
hand one thing about this line is that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.410 
hand one thing about this line is that
it<00:03:03.780> doesn't<00:03:04.110> come<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.010> lotion<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:06.240> have

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it doesn't come with a lotion you have

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.360 
it doesn't come with a lotion you have
your<00:03:06.660> sulfur<00:03:07.170> wash<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.710> your<00:03:07.860> toner<00:03:08.100> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
your sulfur wash you have your toner and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.430 
your sulfur wash you have your toner and
then<00:03:08.490> have<00:03:08.640> your<00:03:08.760> treatment<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.230> do

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
then have your treatment so if you do

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.170 
then have your treatment so if you do
have<00:03:10.740> dry<00:03:11.640> skin

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
have dry skin

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.770 
have dry skin
I<00:03:12.210> suggest<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.960> getting<00:03:13.350> an<00:03:13.470> SPF<00:03:14.090> lotion<00:03:15.090> that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
I suggest you getting an SPF lotion that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.470 
I suggest you getting an SPF lotion that
will<00:03:16.110> help<00:03:16.440> moisturize<00:03:17.100> your<00:03:17.340> face<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:18.390> a

very<00:03:18.720> basic<00:03:19.250> SPF<00:03:20.270> lotion<00:03:21.270> would<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.630> fine<00:03:21.930> I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
very basic SPF lotion would do fine I

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.460 
very basic SPF lotion would do fine I
actually<00:03:22.880> received<00:03:23.880> one<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:24.540> line<00:03:25.110> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
actually received one in this line and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.130 
actually received one in this line and
this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.680> what<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.310> looks<00:03:26.490> like<00:03:26.760> very<00:03:27.660> standard

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
this is what it looks like very standard

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.590 
this is what it looks like very standard
SPF<00:03:28.710> 20<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:29.640> my<00:03:29.790> skin<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.210> dried<00:03:30.420> out<00:03:30.570> a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
SPF 20 so if my skin is dried out a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.630 
SPF 20 so if my skin is dried out a
little<00:03:30.690> bit<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.080> will<00:03:31.260> apply<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.310> skin
