00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.819
 to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.600
 hello, only the client comes with the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.020
 partnership with net face the balance point 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.570
 com and show a umf a speaker 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.050
 designated for severe medium 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.619
 this is our 420 ms model 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.559
 using a magnet and 169 by 20 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.949
 mm upper washer in 5 black 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:40.180
 which ensures greater heat dissipation 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:43.300
 double in costume in cornwall system 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.870
 within the central patent 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.550
 also from the digital design housing 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.320
 1,5 thousand clean sheet which is double the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.350
 thickness used by the competitor 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.830
 closer, which guarantees less 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.220
 vibration greater one hour playback 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.510
 sonora the whole series of digital grape 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 420 design uses vacuum colors 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.570
 which guarantees an audio quality 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.910
 higher than the companies that are 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 using pressed cone 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.560
 besides that our lufer internally 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.290
 is using the chorin system that is 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.980
 an aluminum ring that goes over the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.790
 central pole of the motor system ensuring 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.250
 better timbre plus heat dissipation and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 guaranteeing the product a final audio 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.370
 best 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.230
 another detail that should that is very 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.550
 important to highlight in our line of 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.650
 grape is we do not work with 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.040
 impedance on coils for 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.470
 pass a false illusion of performance 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.409
 if the product is four men it will be 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.180
 4 years to get the efficiency of the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.490
 digital design agenda product no 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.170
 agrees with this type of application in 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.810
 to lower the speaker impedance 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.720
 then we guarantee the performance in 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 high quality components 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.209
 What are we putting the speaker in? 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.040
 using a coil with the impedance 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.630
 nominal in four men are obviously 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.110
 amplified will consume less 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.740
 battery and the speaker will consequently 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.800
 gain a lot of durability and its sound 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.670
 will play for many more hours later 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.310
 because the impedance is being respected 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.410
 nominal 4 coil men 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.860
 it's very easy to make a speaker 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.010
 low competence and pass it on to you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.040
 customers a false illusion of performance 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.130
 but the wearer 's wear will suffer 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.460
 the entire electrical system of your 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.500
 car will suffer because of the company 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.580
 in this low then great highlight and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.150
 efficiency 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.010
 I keep the nominal impedance high at 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.490
 420 model 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 We have three sizes 10 12 and 15 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.560
 inches all available 420 watts 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.850
 rms is worth testing and if it is 420 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.290
 for medium to severe medium-high very 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.290
 dashboard of your car 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.520
