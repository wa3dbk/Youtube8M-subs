00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 then sink a little today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 video that will be how queens 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.960
 with a lanyard 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.190
 so you need agricultural or here it is 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.779
 so here we have to imagine that this is the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 head of the head the head of your horse 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 with the halter and we will take care of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 the valley and you will need 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 well obviously a sleeve I 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 strongly advise the lanyards 3 m because 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 the languages ​​of two meters are a lot 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 far too small 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.329
 so that's it then we take bajeux thing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 carabiner and have the task at the ring 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:51.149
 Then we'll take me over there the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.360
 end of the loin by the end of the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.359
 long fight m in there we shoot 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.500
 do not pull too much either 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 that you have to leave some length to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 the reins but enough because after the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 knot is quite complex 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 so that's enough 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.799
 arrived at these levels there when you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 have passed the hand or in the ring you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:24.420
 go make a loop with wana then 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 you're going to hop a loop that you have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.079
 passed behind this rope there and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 behind the carabiner that gives that and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:45.470
 you're going a rolled carabiner with 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.470
 the sleeve so we roll up 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.550
 we see there 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.030
 arrived at this level there we put the pulse 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.680
 of the loin 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:10.350
 in the loop and pulls down one 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.290
 will give you something like that happen 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.130
 at this level we will take this end of 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:28.320
 is going there and we will make the most of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 so here it is, sure shot is too much 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:41.730
 it's too low to draw on that 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 and that at the same time here and so here 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:55.200
 it's you that makes you the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:59.730
 queens downstairs hop and after you're gonna 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.570
 fly past behind the neckline which 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.570
 give something like that 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.530
 here I hope I explained well and 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.940
 we will find ourselves in the next 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.940
 tuto videos see you soon
