00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
countertop did you do anything with the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
countertop did you do anything with the
edging<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.649> particular<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.220> had<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> little

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
edging this particular one had a little

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
edging this particular one had a little
bit<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> ledge<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.119> left<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.479> edge<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
bit of a ledge we left that edge but you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780 
bit of a ledge we left that edge but you
can<00:01:52.229> chain<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.710> too<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.670> either

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
can chain it too and you can either

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
can chain it too and you can either
router<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> edge<00:01:54.509> or<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.079> add<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
router that edge or we can add a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.679 
router that edge or we can add a
bullnose<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> adding<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> bullnose<00:01:57.090> really

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
bullnose and adding a bullnose really

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.910 
bullnose and adding a bullnose really
creates<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> different<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
creates a different look and it really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
creates a different look and it really
makes<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.250> look<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.549> another<00:01:59.759> solid<00:02:00.210> surface

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
makes it look like another solid surface

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969

unit<00:04:40.750> like<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:41.020> how<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.380> kind<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.890> matches<00:04:42.100> up

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
unit like this how it kind of matches up

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.190 
unit like this how it kind of matches up
with<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.760> upper<00:04:43.300> portion<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.840> bathroom

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
with the upper portion of the bathroom

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.660 
with the upper portion of the bathroom
and<00:04:44.320> if<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.500> were<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.740> tear<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.220> out

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
and if you were to tear this out

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.880 
and if you were to tear this out
I<00:04:45.700> couldn't<00:04:46.510> imagine<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:47.169> damage<00:04:47.650> all<00:04:47.860> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
I couldn't imagine you damage all the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.770 
I couldn't imagine you damage all the
tile<00:04:48.280> you'd<00:04:48.610> have<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.880> replace<00:04:49.210> everything<00:04:49.690> it

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
tile you'd have to replace everything it

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.960 
tile you'd have to replace everything it
would<00:04:49.840> probably<00:04:50.020> be<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> lot<00:04:50.410> more<00:04:50.470> expensive

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
would probably be a lot more expensive

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.800 
would probably be a lot more expensive
exactly<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.030> think<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.300> would<00:04:52.419> have<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.630> tear

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
exactly I think you would have to tear

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.780 
exactly I think you would have to tear
out<00:04:52.930> all<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.140> tile<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.680> this<00:04:53.800> out<00:04:53.980> okay<00:04:54.520> so

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
out all the tile to get this out okay so

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.970 
out all the tile to get this out okay so
did<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.090> also<00:04:55.270> do<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.630> vanity<00:04:56.020> top<00:04:56.200> here<00:04:56.470> yes

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
did you also do the vanity top here yes

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.860 
did you also do the vanity top here yes
spraying<00:04:57.430> at<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.669> same<00:04:57.820> time<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.300> spray<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
spraying at the same time I spray the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.540 
spraying at the same time I spray the
tub<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.440> vanity<00:04:59.740> top<00:04:59.919> in<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.130> same<00:05:00.310> color

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
same color this looks quite a bit

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.560 
same color this looks quite a bit
lighter<00:05:03.040> than<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.669> grey<00:05:03.910> they<00:05:04.090> selected<00:05:04.480> down

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
lighter than the grey they selected down

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.150 
lighter than the grey they selected down
here<00:05:04.840> that's<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.560> beauty<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.040> natural

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
here that's the beauty of the natural

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.000 
here that's the beauty of the natural
accent<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:07.140> tends<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.230> look<00:05:08.470> different

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
accent it tends to look different

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.640 
accent it tends to look different
depending<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:09.910> light<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:11.110> color<00:05:11.350> of

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
depending on the light and the color of

the paint or wall surrounding it it

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.270 
the paint or wall surrounding it it
always<00:05:13.960> looks<00:05:14.169> different<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.860> makes<00:05:15.070> sense

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
always looks different it makes sense

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.950 
always looks different it makes sense
why<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.460> called<00:05:15.700> natural<00:05:16.060> absent<00:05:16.480> those<00:05:16.810> are

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
why I called natural absent those are

why I called natural absent those are
the<00:05:17.050> same<00:05:17.230> characteristics<00:05:17.950> of<00:05:18.070> natural

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
the same characteristics of natural

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.190 
the same characteristics of natural

stone depending on what it's up against

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.930 
stone depending on what it's up against
in<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.350> lighting<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.340> look<00:05:21.490> different<00:05:21.669> at

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
in the lighting it can look different at

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.610 
in the lighting it can look different at
different<00:05:21.970> times<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.600> day<00:05:22.630> what<00:05:23.380> about<00:05:23.590> a
