 young gamoniac to coach gamoniac style 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 not x classic then it's my 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 favorite because I know since 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.600
 that he is very little nani well led to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.870
 who has neither the race he gamoniac of vix 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 vanoise aubert of vix capitalist to six 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 currency to the flu stays at fifteen 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:51.390
 no no no fifteen years he rectify 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.940
 the season and the last the most shy 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 and the funniest of udc 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 gamoniac deluxe 17 so already ben it can 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 to say that you have been clearly this 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.129
 revelation what revelations we can not 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 say that because you still have 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.340
 makes an excellent excellent 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.780
 season forgiveness on mw3 but you have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210
 does a huge performance so at the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 fair wind arena 2 for now the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.939
 filming is going pretty well 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.950
 nani for now we had so we 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.049
 had three group matches one has win 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.990
 from and with package so we beat 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.360
 the rangers nitrates yolo boys so some 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.670
 German and lighthouses and corinne for 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320
 enel it's a win by forfeit then 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 had a first so the eighth of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.750
 final at windham racket we played 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.799
 against the bobs so that's a second 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 well who french what are we playing at the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.680
 night so the bobs whose heroines 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.060
 zero and here we will play against the far 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.060
 starz schools after the match and ignoble 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 it's true that in fact your performance 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.220
 both at wynn arena 2 did you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.980
 know a little bit more about the big 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.160
 public if we can say that this is 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.200
 that there is more pressure on you 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.540
 to this lan or how was the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.440
 preparation 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.820
 the pressure I 'm not doing because the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.050
 pressure really has never had at each 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.080
 times we attack the matches as 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.190
 what to actually do is there for windows 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.869
 well it was a great performance 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.460
 but that's the same thing we do not know 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.750
 conquered stables we play costa on 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.800
 never played French teams 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.959
 we knew how he had 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.090
 played so we knew how to adapt 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.590
 but there the European line c2 first 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.150
 together we do not know how 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.170
 manufacturers play it we know they are 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.760
 composed of four players anyway 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.400
 known the scene that did everything 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.410
 result his peers it's beautiful when the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.580
 of Europeans and we did not do big 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.950
 thing we have a European in the memory 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.260
 in fact finally by dylan and greek who have 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.360
 done knock 9 12 aisle i have so on after 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.430
 we still apprehend this match on 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.600
 hope to be able to play to the maximum 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.130
 can and not have difficulties 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.740
 so we have a relatively wool 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.600
 homogeneous visa and what is the team 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.630
 that you dread the most and what is your 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.620
 prognosis on this lan me I see well 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.900
 the millennium win with the dragons 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 102nd 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.349
 lower them in a third luxury 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 do you have a little bit of 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.520
 looked millenium and what do you think 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.920
 finally 2 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.210
 of this team sure of this study on 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.920
 this game start is really 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.300
 portois the team that makes you the most 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.190
 afraid it's the team that everyone 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.450
 wait it's I think it's the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 best in europe for now and then 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.180
 I think they will win the lane 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.730
 easily I think is still luxury 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 you that she was the ambition of this 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.110
 roster there that we came to our 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:49.310
 top prognosis your top top top 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.710
 5 6 either it was good we were gone for 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.110
 to be in the top 8 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.100
 top 5 if it's good but beyond 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.020
 even better and last question so 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.630
 for the manager jaunards we all ask ourselves 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.860
 the question now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.940
 gamania who has gone so we structure 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.400
 professional with sci is mayor so 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.960
 now what are we doing here? 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.020

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.650
 that we understand a little better here it is 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.750
