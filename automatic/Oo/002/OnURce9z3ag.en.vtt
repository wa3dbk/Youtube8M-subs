00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
pretty crappy but it's just kind of

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.559 
pretty crappy but it's just kind of

setting that the genre has died off and
I<00:03:15.600> really<00:03:15.810> hope<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.170> launch<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.530> new

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
I really hope with the launch of a new

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
I really hope with the launch of a new
system<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.459> know<00:03:17.579> companies<00:03:17.820> typically<00:03:18.269> take

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
system you know companies typically take

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.810 
system you know companies typically take
chances<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.079> first<00:03:19.230> launch<00:03:20.070> here<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:20.790> a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
chances in the first launch here for a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.759 
chances in the first launch here for a
couple<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.060> reasons<00:03:21.180> one<00:03:21.480> they<00:03:21.750> need<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.590> just

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
couple of reasons one they need to just

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.979 
couple of reasons one they need to just
sort<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.040> test<00:03:23.250> things<00:03:23.519> out<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.000> test<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.570> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
do some fun stuff and the install base

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.160 
do some fun stuff and the install base
isn't<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.209> big<00:03:42.390> already<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.049> game

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
isn't that big already so if a game

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690 
isn't that big already so if a game
doesn't<00:03:43.410> sell<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.859> well<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.220> okay<00:03:44.519> they<00:03:44.670> just

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
doesn't sell as well it's okay they just

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.610 
doesn't sell as well it's okay they just
got<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> put<00:03:45.180> software<00:03:45.540> out<00:03:45.630> there<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.230> more

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
got to put software out there so more

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.930 
got to put software out there so more
risks<00:03:46.920> are<00:03:47.010> taking<00:03:47.280> I'm<00:03:47.370> kind<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.670> really

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
risks are taking I'm kind of really

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.330 
risks are taking I'm kind of really
really<00:03:48.420> hoping<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.989> someone<00:03:49.620> does<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.859> sweet

the closest example of something that

the closest example of something that

traversal and

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
quite a bit of climbing but it's kind of

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.810 
quite a bit of climbing but it's kind of
been<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.410> stand-in<00:04:30.410> for<00:04:30.440> all<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.580> lego
