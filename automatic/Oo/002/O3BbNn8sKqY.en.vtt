00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
for a more urban writers we have a new

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
wheel called the Solar Probe this is a

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.160 
wheel called the Solar Probe this is a
38<00:01:36.370> millimeter<00:01:36.790> deep<00:01:37.030> room<00:01:37.300> gives<00:01:37.930> us<00:01:38.050> a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
38 millimeter deep room gives us a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.930 
38 millimeter deep room gives us a
chance<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.500> put<00:01:38.800> a<00:01:38.830> lot<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.190> fashion<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.730> color

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
chance to put a lot of fashion and color

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.250 
chance to put a lot of fashion and color
into<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.330> wheel<00:01:40.510> uses<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.410> cartridge<00:01:41.860> bearing

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
into the wheel uses a cartridge bearing

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.170 
into the wheel uses a cartridge bearing
and<00:01:44.260> then<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.440> double<00:01:44.680> threaded<00:01:45.160> freewheel<00:01:45.580> so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
and then a double threaded freewheel so

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.720 
and then a double threaded freewheel so
one<00:01:46.360> side<00:01:46.570> for<00:01:46.780> track<00:01:47.020> fixed<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.490> then<00:01:48.580> one

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
one side for track fixed and then one

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.040 
one side for track fixed and then one
side<00:01:48.970> for<00:01:49.150> freewheel<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:49.840> an<00:01:49.930> easy

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
side for freewheel so it's an easy

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.620 
side for freewheel so it's an easy
flip-flop<00:01:50.560> hub<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.030> nice<00:01:52.180> wheel<00:01:52.420> set
