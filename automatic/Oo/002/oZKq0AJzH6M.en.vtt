00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
nice it's full modular like I said

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
nice it's full modular like I said
before<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.390> comes<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.290> dual<00:01:34.829> imaging<00:01:35.430> cpu<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
before I comes with dual imaging cpu a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
before I comes with dual imaging cpu a
pen<00:01:36.829> but<00:01:37.829> we'll<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.490> get

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to the cables so it is full modular

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.410 
to the cables so it is full modular
looks<00:01:41.009> fantastic<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.150> sit<00:01:42.390> in

already back at EVGA and if you take a
look<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> wattage<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> specifications

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
look at the wattage of specifications

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.550 
look at the wattage of specifications
ratings<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> top<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.200> take<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> look

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
ratings on the top you can take a look

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.949 
ratings on the top you can take a look
at<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.370> has<00:02:11.640> 62<00:02:12.209> amps<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
at that there it has 62 amps on the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.440 
at that there it has 62 amps on the
single<00:02:13.319> Dogen<00:02:13.709> rail<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:15.030> single<00:02:15.300> tool

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
thought too and then it just has a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.000 
thought too and then it just has a
little<00:02:47.220> manual<00:02:47.790> guide<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.360> shows<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.010> where

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

all the amps and things go specifically

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.930 
all the amps and things go specifically
probably<00:02:53.879> good<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.030> people<00:02:54.269> who<00:02:54.480> sleep<00:02:54.690> I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940

could<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:41.020> well<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.380> then<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:41.830> get<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.010> 24-pin

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
could as well and then you get a 24-pin

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.200 
could as well and then you get a 24-pin
which<00:05:43.930> is<00:05:44.139> which<00:05:45.010> is<00:05:45.039> look<00:05:45.520> at<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.849> heat

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
which is which is look at that heat

which is which is look at that heat
shrink<00:05:46.539> on<00:05:46.660> which<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.020> uglier<00:05:47.560> than<00:05:48.190> all<00:05:48.430> sin

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
shrink on which is uglier than all sin

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.700 
shrink on which is uglier than all sin
that<00:05:49.360> as<00:05:49.479> matt<00:05:49.810> has<00:05:49.960> ever<00:05:50.169> done<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.590> its

history of existing and it's not very

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.370 
history of existing and it's not very
long<00:05:53.889> ooh<00:05:54.479> could<00:05:55.479> be<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.810> could<00:05:55.960> be<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.229> little

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
long ooh could be it could be a little

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.110 
long ooh could be it could be a little
bit<00:05:56.530> longer<00:05:56.680> but<00:05:56.889> they<00:05:57.130> did<00:05:57.340> manage<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.940> not

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
put 24 plus so it's just a 24-pin not a

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.040 
put 24 plus so it's just a 24-pin not a
20-plus<00:06:02.110> workman<00:06:02.970> yeah<00:06:03.970> I<00:06:04.000> guess<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.660> can't<00:06:04.870> set
