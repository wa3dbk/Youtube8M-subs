00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.920
 welcome to west brabant leg welcome to both works my name is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.800
 andrÃ© jansen I have a dairy farm here of around 110 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 dairy cows with a large surface of more than 6 60 hectares 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.800
 she pointed his arrows easily accessible 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.779
 we have free but is 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 the curator causing them to sprout onions near the potatoes and so on 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.649
 heavy rainfall 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.050
 at one of the two Belgians 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 the world fell to 6 9 last week 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 before 65 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 from 19 6 and 9 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.450
 in May 2005 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.730
 veenendaal recalled 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.630
 to have more social freedom 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.680
 and to work carried out 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.670
 it is a good service series as the first person nowadays always a bit pathetic 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.350
 Rebellious years of success if you see how many site recent numbers will make them 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.720
 in the U.S 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.549
 the management program where the milking robot becomes 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 also sends an amount for going into the box house 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.569
 I can provide four different types of food for this box 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.380
 one of these types is also the drugs now minerals 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 was automatically installed for system in 2008 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 the automatic for system consists of two components 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.190
 the hd year 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.160
 Produced by overtime is the mining that is located in the lies on 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 barn mixes perform and that sets it for the cows 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.830
 in the vehicles where we are now 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.430
 this creates the temptation 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.700
 the incident is needed to get the right mixture 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.490
 First, the highest point in the party is determined by means of this 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.000
 from a reader 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 the scans the party 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.370
 at the highest point is then 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.010
 the ship sailed 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.630
 both components 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.410
 communicate with each other 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.560
 if the perpetrator has enough kilos of a certain product 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.499
 send it through the perdana the following products 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.109
 to then also create the correct number of kilos thereof 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.879
 by this time it then brings to a conveyor belt 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.739
 which causes it to feed 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.099
 ends up in the mixing bowl 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.430
 because the footpath 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.100
 which in the traditional setup was five meters 50 wide 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.430
 halved more than halved first I had the opportunity all over the line 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.779
 boxing is to make 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.739
 this means that 120 berths for dairy cows can now be discussed 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.339
 the combination with two Belgians is stupid or is this one 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.889
 but my ideas efficient implementation of the building from 20 to 50 meters 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.829
 from 2005 onwards I have been quite involved in automation 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.209
 we have always liked it next 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.259
 the company he puts under the hold 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.989
 110 walk 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.909
 every time the opportunity at ten to fifteen hours a week 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
 to update elsewhere 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.559
 to my company 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.989
 has grown considerably for twelve years 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.509
 an extensive in every production 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.689
 the 300,000 liters in nineteen 96 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.839
 then we are very soggy 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.929
 reduction continues sofie now goes 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.929
 come across from or come to the 2 million this year 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.299
 for me the company is actually quite reasonable in the degree of automation 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.829
 optimal 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.479
 we are not at the end 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.999
 the feed partly 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.189
 I have no ambition at the moment 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.909
 to continue further is scaling up 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.729
 but who knows in the future 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.889
 is that going to happen anyway and the company will expand to four or more too 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.279
 this end may and may be the beginning 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:54.359
 better for the it's for me 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.989
 put the animal at the center 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.379
 concentrate therefore not in the base at least in the base when mixed 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.249
 but mainly on which you do not provide much 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.699
 also from an economic point of view this is in my opinion 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.159
 most interesting option
