00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.969 
now this doesn't happen all the time you
know<00:01:50.840> sometimes<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.410> might<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.620> really

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
know sometimes you might get really

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:52.480 
know sometimes you might get really
lucky

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
lucky

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
lucky
most<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.060> these<00:01:53.180> lenders<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:54.050> low

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
most of these lenders have a really low

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
most of these lenders have a really low
catch<00:01:54.410> rate<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.010> it's<00:01:55.400> all<00:01:55.700> just<00:01:55.760> luck

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
catch rate so it's all just luck

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.120 
catch rate so it's all just luck
sometimes<00:01:56.990> you'll<00:01:57.380> get<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.650> sometimes<00:01:58.010> you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
sometimes you'll get it sometimes you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.499 
sometimes you'll get it sometimes you
won't<00:01:58.780> and<00:02:00.400> surprisingly<00:02:01.400> I'm<00:02:01.850> surprisingly

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
won't and surprisingly I'm surprisingly

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.969 
won't and surprisingly I'm surprisingly
enough<00:02:02.840> since<00:02:03.200> we<00:02:03.350> caught<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.650> with<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.770> quick

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
enough since we caught it with a quick

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.240 
enough since we caught it with a quick
ball<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.400> think<00:02:04.670> we'll<00:02:05.150> be<00:02:05.390> doing<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.500> latias

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
ball I think we'll be doing the latias

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.300 
ball I think we'll be doing the latias
event<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.850> well<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:11.470> all<00:02:12.470> right<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.100> what

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
event as well so all right so is what

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.130 
event as well so all right so is what
you<00:02:13.370> gonna<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.640> since<00:02:14.570> pretty<00:02:14.870> much<00:02:15.020> you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
you gonna do since pretty much you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.490 
you gonna do since pretty much you
cannot<00:02:15.470> get<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> Enigma<00:02:16.430> stoned<00:02:16.700> anymore

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
cannot get the Enigma stoned anymore

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.330 
cannot get the Enigma stoned anymore
you<00:02:18.500> probably<00:02:18.620> have<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> use<00:02:19.040> an<00:02:19.100> action

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you probably have to use an action

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.650 
you probably have to use an action
replay<00:02:19.520> code<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.090> I'll<00:02:20.180> leave<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.600> the

in the description for you guys to use
you<00:02:26.840> guys<00:02:26.959> can<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.680> ma<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.090> sure<00:02:29.330> how

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you guys can do this ma I'm not sure how

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.810 
you guys can do this ma I'm not sure how
it<00:02:29.510> works<00:02:29.630> no<00:02:29.989> cache<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:31.160> you'll<00:02:31.400> find<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.700> way

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
it works no cache but you'll find a way

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.250 
it works no cache but you'll find a way
or<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.480> want<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.750> input<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.230> your

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
or if you just want to input in your

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.780 
or if you just want to input in your
action<00:02:33.620> replay<00:02:33.950> well<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.430> all<00:02:34.610> works<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:36.790> when

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
action replay well it all works so when

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.280 
action replay well it all works so when
you<00:02:37.850> do<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.120> makes<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.420> save<00:02:38.630> your<00:02:38.780> game<00:02:38.959> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you do it makes you save your game I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.190 
you do it makes you save your game I
think<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.670> press<00:02:40.880> L<00:02:41.090> when<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:41.989> walk

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
think you have to press L when you walk

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.650 
think you have to press L when you walk
into<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.560> Pokemon<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.190> he<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.550> appear<00:02:44.000> then

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
into the Pokemon and he will appear then

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.090 
into the Pokemon and he will appear then
again<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.959> capture<00:02:45.290> do<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.560> many<00:02:45.709> times<00:02:45.950> as

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
again you capture do it as many times as

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.280 
again you capture do it as many times as
you<00:02:46.220> want<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.970> doesn't<00:02:47.269> even<00:02:47.330> matter<00:02:47.600> so

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
you want so it doesn't even matter so

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.050 
you want so it doesn't even matter so
now<00:02:49.130> we<00:02:49.190> got<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.489> go<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.640> Pewter<00:02:50.120> City<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:53.000> is

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
now we got to go to Pewter City this is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.759 
now we got to go to Pewter City this is
the<00:02:53.209> city<00:02:53.480> where<00:02:53.570> actually<00:02:53.870> Museum<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.500> and

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
the city where actually Museum is and

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.350 
the city where actually Museum is and
were<00:02:55.670> Brock's<00:02:56.630> gym<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.230> since<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.519> guess<00:02:59.150> it

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
were Brock's gym is since I guess it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.259 
were Brock's gym is since I guess it
seems<00:02:59.630> right<00:02:59.900> because<00:03:00.200> he's<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> rock-type<00:03:00.680> and

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
seems right because he's a rock-type and

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.990 
seems right because he's a rock-type and
most<00:03:02.269> falsi<00:03:02.959> pokemon<00:03:03.380> all<00:03:03.530> rock<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.160> bug

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
most falsi pokemon all rock and bug

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.590 
most falsi pokemon all rock and bug
which<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.540> weird<00:03:06.489> all<00:03:07.489> right<00:03:07.549> so<00:03:07.850> let's<00:03:08.269> get<00:03:08.480> in

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
which is weird all right so let's get in

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.539 
which is weird all right so let's get in
here<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:10.570> well<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> museum<00:03:12.350> now<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.370> actually

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
here and well a museum now it's actually

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.509 
here and well a museum now it's actually
smaller<00:03:13.880> than<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.239> thought<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.370> who<00:03:16.370> do<00:03:16.459> we

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
smaller than I thought and who do we

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.539 
smaller than I thought and who do we
have<00:03:16.700> here<00:03:17.000> Steven<00:03:17.780> holy<00:03:18.140> crap<00:03:18.769> what's<00:03:19.040> Steven

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
have here Steven holy crap what's Steven

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.990 
have here Steven holy crap what's Steven
doing<00:03:19.790> here<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.650> he<00:03:22.280> notices<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:22.880> have

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
doing here so he notices that we have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.670 
doing here so he notices that we have
that<00:03:23.090> nygma<00:03:23.390> stone<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.870> he<00:03:23.989> won't<00:03:24.200> be<00:03:24.380> here

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
that nygma stone and he won't be here

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.580 
that nygma stone and he won't be here
unless<00:03:24.829> you<00:03:25.459> actually<00:03:25.760> did<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.810> event<00:03:27.110> so

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
unless you actually did the event so

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.009 
unless you actually did the event so
it's<00:03:28.130> gonna<00:03:28.220> be<00:03:28.430> Spanish<00:03:29.030> did<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.510> give<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it's gonna be Spanish did you give it to

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.710 
it's gonna be Spanish did you give it to
this<00:03:30.160> nerd<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.549> he's<00:03:31.670> gonna

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
this nerd and he's gonna

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.289 
this nerd and he's gonna
all<00:03:34.720> right<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.200> apparently<00:03:35.920> he<00:03:36.400> finds<00:03:36.790> solty

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
all right so apparently he finds solty

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.820 
all right so apparently he finds solty
which<00:03:37.510> sold<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.959> one<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> most<00:03:38.500> powerful

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
which sold is one of the most powerful

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.210 
which sold is one of the most powerful
items<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.760> lattice<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.420> Latios<00:03:40.959> only<00:03:41.530> it

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
items for lattice and Latios only it

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.320 
items for lattice and Latios only it
does<00:03:42.489> increase<00:03:42.879> their<00:03:43.209> attacks<00:03:43.510> by<00:03:43.780> 1.5<00:03:44.769> or

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
does increase their attacks by 1.5 or

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.080 
does increase their attacks by 1.5 or
times<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.569> by<00:03:46.659> 1.5<00:03:47.290> which<00:03:47.500> does<00:03:48.010> pretty<00:03:48.459> good

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
times it by 1.5 which does pretty good

can<00:06:51.770> learn<00:06:52.100> yawn<00:06:52.610> or<00:06:53.000> sleep<00:06:53.360> powder<00:06:53.600> I<00:06:54.050> think

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620
