oh<00:02:19.410> no<00:02:20.410> camera<00:02:20.830> shy<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.250> she<00:02:21.570> anyway<00:02:22.570> yes<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.650> do

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
oh no camera shy is she anyway yes I do

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.370 
oh no camera shy is she anyway yes I do
think<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.250> more<00:02:24.459> expensive<00:02:24.840> especially<00:02:25.840> if

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
think it's more expensive especially if

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.910 
think it's more expensive especially if
you<00:02:26.620> have<00:02:26.650> people<00:02:27.100> who<00:02:27.519> are<00:02:27.970> not<00:02:28.239> also

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you have people who are not also

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.430 
you have people who are not also
on<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.099> raw<00:02:30.520> food<00:02:30.760> diet<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.810> think<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.230> if

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
on a raw food diet but I think that if

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.380 
on a raw food diet but I think that if
you<00:02:32.560> could<00:02:32.680> get<00:02:32.860> everyone<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.580> your<00:02:33.610> family<00:02:33.880> to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you could get everyone in your family to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.589 
you could get everyone in your family to
convert<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:34.989> raw<00:02:35.230> food<00:02:35.500> diet<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:37.090> guess<00:02:37.390> is

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
convert to a raw food diet my guess is

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.559 
convert to a raw food diet my guess is
it<00:02:37.750> would<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.989> just<00:02:38.230> about<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> same<00:02:39.569> with

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
it would be just about the same with

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.940 
it would be just about the same with
nuts<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.500> seeds<00:02:41.970> included<00:02:42.970> organic<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.080> then

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
nuts and seeds included organic and then

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.830 
nuts and seeds included organic and then
you<00:02:45.099> can<00:02:45.250> probably<00:02:45.430> splurge<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.510> organic

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
you can probably splurge for the organic

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.510 
you can probably splurge for the organic
all<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.890> time<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:50.560> my<00:02:50.830> opinion<00:02:51.100> I'm

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
all the time so that's my opinion I'm

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.000 
all the time so that's my opinion I'm
sticking<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.120> I'm<00:02:52.480> buddy<00:02:52.780> Barry<00:02:53.140> eat<00:02:53.739> your

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
