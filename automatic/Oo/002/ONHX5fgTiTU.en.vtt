00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.840
 he will ride with no crossings now 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.630
 Transitions in general are very important in 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.760
 the solution phase to continue 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.310
 sure that the horse is permeable 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.840
 is that means that it is ready for 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.020
 all the help of the rider 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.239
 react 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.960
 at the transition from the step to despite 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.390
 my two legs a burst of this 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.879
 be evenly impulsive to drive 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.000
 this help does not misunderstand you and one 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.739
 gallop help from that interprets the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.979
 Both buttocks bones need to be forward 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.799
 work and my fingers are too 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:03.860
 very easy to open so you drive 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:06.470
 really do going forward when 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.210
 by parrying from the trot to the step around 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.820
 both bake something propos 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.130
 clamp together thereby tensioning 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 automatically turns my cross on and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.300
 prevents my horse in the end 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.190
 continues to go forward 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.290
 the knees are also light 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.900
 closed and these two help 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.580
 together with small ones 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.730
 half parades you drive through lose 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.730
 can 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.840
 since no one is infallible and also 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.740
 the concentration ever lost 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.900
 can come 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.600
 Even the teacher here happens that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 they wrong in the transition makes the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 means she twists in the upper body 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.660
 These are irregular and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 uneven help at only 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.750
 so he arrived immediately 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.000
 reacted and went awry 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 But who has it immediately with one 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.600
 straightened seat corrected again 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.940
 so get to gallop need 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.009
 i bones my inner law and 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.009
 my inner thigh gives a pulse 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.620
 to drive through to met in the reason 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.080
 taken the same help as from the trot 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.980
 to step I pinch my buttocks 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.750
 something together 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.660
 exciting stays by automatically mine 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.460
 cross and close my knee over 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.070
 So put some pressure on mine 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.540
 because he is so beautiful again 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.880
 see that they are not with your hand 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.740
 withdraws but your hands are in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.340
 each transition completely independent of 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.070
 upper body 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.990
 ie the hands holding it drives 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.540
 actually only loose and by neck 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.080
 and the rest of her body rides the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.300
 transitions 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 that's very important to them 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.200
 transitions not return by hand 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.520
 pulls the horse and the chance 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
 has to kick well 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 in occurred while exposing of defense can 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.770
 Also, they look really nice 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.460
 which springs through that goes down in 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.410
 the paragraph pure all the spit of 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.530
 In the end, horses will spring through their 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.530
 body 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.320
 Often one sees the endangered too thin 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.320
 are placed 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.640
 he does not parry now either and 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.240
 does not start to work properly anymore 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.040
 galloping empty has corrected it by 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.960
 given parades with the outer trains 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.700
 just learns to do so 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.530
 balance is restored and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.760
 then you can drive nice and clean 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.760
 from the gallop to the trap parry 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.439
 Now it's too much inside again 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.930
 I block the inner hind leg with 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.909
 the inner hand now comes the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.689
 Correction and you can drive clean 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.689
 by touching
