here<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> ground<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
here on the ground like I think this is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
here on the ground like I think this is
a<00:00:46.200> great<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> maximize<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.399> vertical

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a great way to maximize your vertical

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
a great way to maximize your vertical
space<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.780> bugs<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.829> when

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
space so it really bugs me here is when

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.819 
space so it really bugs me here is when
you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.180> tall<00:00:51.899> bottles<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you have really tall bottles that just

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
you have really tall bottles that just
like<00:00:52.949> interfere<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> faucet<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
like interfere with the faucet up here

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.470 
like interfere with the faucet up here
and<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> water<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.309> coming<00:00:56.430> down<00:00:56.730> when

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and when the water is coming down when

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
and when the water is coming down when
you<00:00:57.570> grab<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.590> bring<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you grab this you bring it down like the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.119 
you grab this you bring it down like the
water<00:00:59.969> splashes<00:01:00.660> night<00:01:00.960> splashes<00:01:01.559> again<00:01:01.859> when

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
water splashes night splashes again when

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.039 
water splashes night splashes again when
you<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> take

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you put it back up and when you take

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.960 
you put it back up and when you take
something<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.339> weights<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.610> evenly

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
something down the weights not evenly

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
something down the weights not evenly
distributed<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> swing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
distributed then this is going to swing

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
distributed then this is going to swing
back<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> forth<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
back and forth just like that and it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
back and forth just like that and it
makes<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> super<00:01:10.530> annoying<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.400> although<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
makes it super annoying so although this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
makes it super annoying so although this
maximizes<00:01:13.439> space<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.880> fan<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
maximizes space I'm not really a fan of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.350 
maximizes space I'm not really a fan of
this<00:01:15.869> setup<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:17.159> I've<00:01:17.340> done<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.030> avoid
