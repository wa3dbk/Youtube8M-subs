00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
now we come to the actual dough mixing

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.830 
now we come to the actual dough mixing
stage<00:01:13.310> I'm<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.490> start<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.030> adding<00:01:15.450> the

stage I'm gonna start by adding the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.160 
stage I'm gonna start by adding the
water<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> VGO<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> our

water to the VGO and so this is our

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
water to the VGO and so this is our
flavor<00:01:19.470> profile<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.310> dough<00:01:20.490> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
flavor profile for this dough it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
flavor profile for this dough it's
really<00:01:20.970> gonna<00:01:21.060> add<00:01:22.189> make<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> difference<00:01:23.610> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
flip this over the top side first and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
flip this over the top side first and
then<00:02:01.050> back<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> that's<00:02:02.010> gonna<00:02:02.160> again

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
then back over and that's gonna again

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.420 
then back over and that's gonna again
prevent<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.720> dough<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.170> drying<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
prevent this dough from drying out so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.270 
prevent this dough from drying out so
I'll<00:02:05.550> cover<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.260> very<00:02:07.260> tightly<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.920> saran

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I'll cover this very tightly with saran

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
I'll cover this very tightly with saran
wrap<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.180> go<00:02:09.300> into<00:02:09.600> your<00:02:09.690> refrigerator

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
wrap that will go into your refrigerator

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.980 
wrap that will go into your refrigerator
