that I thought I would so basically just

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.050 
that I thought I would so basically just
put<00:01:24.040> together<00:01:24.340> all<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> goals<00:01:24.880> he<00:01:25.000> scored

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
whether it's a penalty because one

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.060 
whether it's a penalty because one

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.950 
header in there and finger a few rainbow
flicks<00:01:30.370> but<00:01:30.610> I'll<00:01:31.000> happen<00:01:31.270> occasionally<00:01:31.510> I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
flicks but I'll happen occasionally I

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.170

didn't<00:01:32.470> mind<00:01:32.590> using<00:01:32.950> him<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:33.280> he<00:01:33.400> did<00:01:33.850> seem

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
didn't mind using him but he did seem

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.560 
didn't mind using him but he did seem
fairly<00:01:34.570> sluggish<00:01:35.370> he<00:01:36.370> also<00:01:36.640> didn't<00:01:37.180> feel<00:01:37.540> like

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
fairly sluggish he also didn't feel like

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.450 
fairly sluggish he also didn't feel like
a<00:01:37.750> winger<00:01:38.140> he<00:01:38.500> played<00:01:38.740> much<00:01:38.950> better<00:01:39.160> as<00:01:39.430> a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
a winger he played much better as a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.220 
a winger he played much better as a
striker<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.270> if<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.450> think<00:01:40.480> him<00:01:40.750> getting<00:01:41.080> him

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
striker so if you think him getting him

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.620 
striker so if you think him getting him
I<00:01:41.410> try<00:01:41.680> shoving<00:01:41.890> him<00:01:42.100> on<00:01:42.220> 49<00:01:43.030> chemistry<00:01:43.480> as<00:01:43.600> a

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
I try shoving him on 49 chemistry as a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.810 
I try shoving him on 49 chemistry as a
striker<00:01:43.990> his<00:01:44.650> shooting<00:01:44.980> wasn't<00:01:45.130> bad<00:01:45.370> but<00:01:45.640> he

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
striker his shooting wasn't bad but he

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.130 
striker his shooting wasn't bad but he
isn't<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.180> type<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.360> player<00:01:46.660> you<00:01:46.690> can<00:01:46.900> score

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
isn't the type of player you can score

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.110 
isn't the type of player you can score

as I said scored a few volleys straight

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.160 
as I said scored a few volleys straight
from<00:01:54.370> rainbow<00:01:54.700> flicks<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.750> quite<00:01:55.960> good

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
from rainbow flicks so it's quite good

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.710 
from rainbow flicks so it's quite good
at<00:01:56.260> that<00:01:56.410> for<00:01:56.590> some<00:01:56.740> reason<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.330> don't<00:01:58.330> really

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
at that for some reason I don't really

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.660 
at that for some reason I don't really
know<00:01:58.900> else<00:01:59.110> was<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.410> say<00:01:59.590> about<00:01:59.650> him<00:01:59.860> really<00:01:59.980> he

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
know else was to say about him really he

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.990 
know else was to say about him really he
was<00:02:00.850> good<00:02:01.180> but<00:02:01.570> he<00:02:02.280> wasn't<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.640> good<00:02:03.820> as<00:02:03.940> I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
was good but he wasn't as good as I

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.840 
was good but he wasn't as good as I
expected<00:02:04.030> him<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.900> be<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.250> think<00:02:06.370> he's<00:02:06.670> going

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
expected him to be so I think he's going

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.389 
expected him to be so I think he's going
for<00:02:07.270> about<00:02:07.420> 30<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.110> 40<00:02:08.530> k<00:02:08.679> now<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.310> be

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
for about 30 to 40 k now and to be

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.280 
for about 30 to 40 k now and to be
honest<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.789> may<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.090> well<00:02:10.209> try<00:02:10.539> yourself<00:02:10.869> as

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
honest you may as well try yourself as

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
honest you may as well try yourself as
that<00:02:11.349> isn't<00:02:12.249> too<00:02:12.549> much<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> silver<00:02:13.420> form<00:02:13.719> I
