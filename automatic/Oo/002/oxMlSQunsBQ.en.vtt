 Hello, this is Haha Kizu Toy. 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.200
 The toys that we will introduce to you today are the robot trains newly introduced at CJ E &amp; M 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 It's an animation that turns a train robot into a protagonist. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.660
 First, let's take a look at the robot train k. 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.740
 For a brief description of the character, K is the fastest train in the world 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.300
 It's the only thing that can penetrate a tunnel in Train World. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.180
 The motif is a roller coaster with trains all over the world 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.180
 It seems to be characterized by train. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.280
 Transforms from normal train mode to robot mode 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 Includes unit mode to mount upgradable units 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.900
 I can reproduce three modes. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.680
 Let's start with the appearance of the box. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.400
 The age of use is over 3 years old and the product name and warning text are on the front. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 Eugene Robot, the manufacturer, logo of the World Company 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.780
 The activation hologram sticker is attached. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.540
 If you look at the side, Robot mode and Traffic mode 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.260
 Unit mode Three modes of transformation are illustrated 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 In the back, there are three detailed descriptions of the Unic as well as a photograph. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.440
 Appearance characters are also marked 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.160
 Each unit in the play is kept in a carriage. 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.640
 It is included in deluxe k. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 At the bottom is a note and I see the manufacturer and the manufacturer's logo. 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.760
 CJ E &amp; M, POS Creative Party, Eugene Robot logo. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 Then I will be opening it. Be careful when using knives. 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.380
 So far you've looked at the robot train kits together. 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.540
 Difficulty and detailed painting are noticeable. 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.020
 It seems to be a great toy for preschoolers. 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.640
 Animated robot train made with pure domestic technology 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.820
 On February 26, the first broadcast on SBS 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.120
 It will be airing on Tooniverse from March 18th. 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.860

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.240
