00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.000
 Listen, Charly. 

00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.000
 Listen, Charly. 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 What a great idea to come to the Japanese tv program. 

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.933
 It is very important to pass our message on the Japanese market. 

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.233
 And how. 

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.600
 Oh, damn, you're in this ad! 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.100
 And because I will be training Yokohama Flugels. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.433
 I am well known here. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.833
 That we are going in a few minutes. 

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.242
 Do you know Japanese? 

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.800
 Sandro, I've always said Japanese is a very intuitive language. 

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.600
 Get ready, go in. 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:44.333
 Míster, I do not know what Puyi figured out, but he hypnotized not only Neymar. 

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.733
 He hypnotized them all. 

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.567
 My God, my God, where is the ball? 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.300
 Someone has to shoot. My! 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.867
 Phew, but effort. A little water, please. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.667
 Niiiieeeeeeeee! We can not take unnecessary risks! 

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.067
 Who knows if this water is not irradiated. 

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.533
 It is not like the spring from my city, but it is not contaminated. 

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:31.833
 Charly, where did you bring me? 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.800
 This is the most watched program, you will see a lot of viewers just like you wanted. 

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.100
 This guy is the same as he was outside? 

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:52.100
 At the beginning, all Japanese look the same, but then you get used to it and start to see the differences. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.510
 Charlu Rexachu 

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.400
 Rosel 

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.100
 She sends kisses. 

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.330
 (in Japanese) Kana Kuni ... 

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.300
 He says that what Cuní? 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.870
 No, he does not say any Cuní. 

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.700
 He says he wants you to say something. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.200
 I will say something that can be politically incorrect ... 

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.900
 Politically incorrect? 

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:45.070
 Politically incorrect! 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.430
 What's happening? What did he say? 

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.670
 That you want to try "double or not at all". 

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.200
 And that you will do it here in the middle. 

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:54.670
 Well, nothing happens. 

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:03.630
 You must drink this wasabi soup while dancing macarena. 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.100
 Dance, dance, dance! 

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.070
 Are you saying we're selling shirts here? 

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:27.330
 I do not know, but they have a lot of laughter from us.
