guitar<00:00:19.080> plays<00:00:19.550> thinks<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> action<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
guitar plays thinks the action is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.320 
guitar plays thinks the action is
perfect<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> however<00:00:22.670> his<00:00:23.670> trim<00:00:24.060> is

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
perfect on it however his trim is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.349 
perfect on it however his trim is
flushed<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.019> body<00:00:25.609> he<00:00:26.609> wants<00:00:26.910> me<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> set

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
flushed to the body he wants me to set

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.300 
flushed to the body he wants me to set
it<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.050> floats<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.710> he<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it up so that it floats so he can get a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.849 
it up so that it floats so he can get a
half<00:00:29.519> note<00:00:29.730> draw<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.289> before<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.650> make

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
half note draw on it so before I make

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.490 
half note draw on it so before I make
any<00:00:32.160> adjustments<00:00:32.910> first<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.110> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> do

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.670 
any adjustments first thing I want to do
is<00:00:34.680> take<00:00:35.340> measurements<00:00:36.050> because<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.290> client

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
is take measurements because my client

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200 
is take measurements because my client
loves<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> action<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.059> this

guitar<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:40.399> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.579> sure<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.120> put

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
guitar I want to make sure that we put

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
guitar I want to make sure that we put
it<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.780> exactly<00:00:43.290> where<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:44.030> however

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it back to exactly where it was however

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.299 
it back to exactly where it was however
in<00:00:45.960> order<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> float<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> bridge<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.160> going

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
in order to float this bridge I'm going

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
in order to float this bridge I'm going
to<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> raise<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> bridge<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.930> then

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to need to raise the bridge and then

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.150 
to need to raise the bridge and then
lower<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> saddles<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> first<00:00:52.770> step<00:00:53.010> in

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
lower the saddles the first step in

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
lower the saddles the first step in
measuring<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.520> action<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.500> always<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
measuring the action I always take a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.119 
measuring the action I always take a
capo<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> put<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> top<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.559> fret

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
capo and put it on top of the first fret

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099 
capo and put it on top of the first fret
reason<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> take<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> string

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
reason for that is to take the string

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.429 
reason for that is to take the string
nut<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> equation<00:01:02.840> next<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.320> going

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
nut out of the equation next I'm going

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.490 
nut out of the equation next I'm going
to<00:01:04.559> grab<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.890> action<00:01:05.309> gauge<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> 12th

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to grab my action gauge and at the 12th

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
to grab my action gauge and at the 12th
fret<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> measure<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.970> height<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
fret I'm going to measure the height of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.719 
fret I'm going to measure the height of
the<00:01:09.540> string<00:01:09.900> from<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> top<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> fret<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the string from the top of the fret to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.050 
the string from the top of the fret to
the<00:01:11.760> bottom<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> string<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.850> looks

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the bottom of the string and it looks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
the bottom of the string and it looks
like<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.390> high<00:01:15.600> e<00:01:15.630> we've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.409> about<00:01:16.619> 360

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
like the high e we've got about 360

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.440 
like the high e we've got about 360
fours<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> rest<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> strings<00:01:21.119> tend

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
fours and the rest of the strings tend

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.830 
fours and the rest of the strings tend
to<00:01:21.540> graduate<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.619> 460<00:01:23.580> fourths<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.659> low

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to graduate up to 460 fourths on the low

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.130 
to graduate up to 460 fourths on the low
E<00:01:24.869> string<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.610> perfect<00:01:26.850> action<00:01:27.540> for

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
E string so that's a perfect action for

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
E string so that's a perfect action for
this<00:01:28.229> particular<00:01:28.530> player<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:30.060> our

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
this particular player and that's our

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
this particular player and that's our
target<00:01:31.159> okay<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.820> our

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
target okay now that we have our

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
target okay now that we have our
measurements<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.380> next<00:01:34.680> two<00:01:34.799> things<00:01:34.920> I'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
measurements the next two things I'm

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
measurements the next two things I'm
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> remove<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> bar<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:37.110> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
going to do is remove the bar I'm going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
going to do is remove the bar I'm going
to<00:01:37.350> flip<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> guitar<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
to flip the guitar over and take the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:50.840 
to flip the guitar over and take the
back<00:01:39.030> plate<00:01:39.299> off

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.149 

now<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.030> I've<00:01:52.149> removed<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.630> backplate<00:01:53.159> we

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
now that I've removed the backplate we

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.969 
now that I've removed the backplate we
can<00:01:54.340> see<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.670> there<00:01:54.970> are<00:01:55.060> five<00:01:55.329> Springs

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
can see that there are five Springs

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.279 
can see that there are five Springs
holding<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.130> inertia<00:01:57.430> block<00:01:57.789> of<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.000> trim<00:01:58.299> to

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
holding the inertia block of the trim to

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.300 
holding the inertia block of the trim to
the<00:01:59.380> claw<00:01:59.649> this<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.700> way<00:02:01.090> too<00:02:01.149> many<00:02:01.810> Springs<00:02:02.380> in

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the claw this is way too many Springs in

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.039 
the claw this is way too many Springs in
order<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.640> float<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.000> tremolo<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.869> what

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
order to float that tremolo so what

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.660 
order to float that tremolo so what
we're<00:02:05.170> going<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:06.189> I'm<00:02:06.340> going<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> remove

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
we're going to do is I'm going to remove

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.999 
we're going to do is I'm going to remove
a<00:02:06.909> couple<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.270> these<00:02:07.360> Springs<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.800> going

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
a couple of these Springs and I'm going

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.930 
a couple of these Springs and I'm going
to<00:02:09.069> rearrange<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:10.179> angle<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.440> springs

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to rearrange the angle of the springs

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.610 
to rearrange the angle of the springs
that<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.450> maintain<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.200> very

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that way we can maintain a very

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.479 
that way we can maintain a very
consistent<00:02:15.069> tension<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.720> trim<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> of

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
consistent tension on the trim so of

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.580 
consistent tension on the trim so of
these<00:02:18.640> five<00:02:18.850> Springs<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:20.080> looks<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.470> me<00:02:20.500> like

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
these five Springs it looks to me like

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.610 
these five Springs it looks to me like
these<00:02:20.950> three<00:02:21.220> black<00:02:21.489> ones<00:02:21.790> are<00:02:22.030> stock<00:02:22.900> these

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
these three black ones are stock these

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.320 
these three black ones are stock these
other<00:02:23.890> two<00:02:24.130> look<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.459> they're<00:02:24.640> aftermarket

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
other two look like they're aftermarket

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.300 
other two look like they're aftermarket
so<00:02:26.019> what<00:02:26.110> I'm<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.350> do<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.769> remove<00:02:27.069> those

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
so what I'm going to do to remove those

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.890 
so what I'm going to do to remove those
is<00:02:27.640> first<00:02:27.910> I'm<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> put<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> bar<00:02:28.630> back

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
is first I'm going to put the bar back

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.009 
is first I'm going to put the bar back
into<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> tremolo<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:31.150> way<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.299> can<00:02:31.450> keep

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
into the tremolo and that way I can keep

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.839 
into the tremolo and that way I can keep
some<00:02:32.260> tension<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.799> while<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.099> pop<00:02:33.400> these<00:02:33.610> two

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
some tension on it while I pop these two

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:47.130 
some tension on it while I pop these two
out

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.059 

now<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.319> I've<00:02:48.440> removed<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.920> two

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
now that I've removed the two

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.009 
now that I've removed the two
aftermarket<00:02:49.790> Springs<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.959> to

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
aftermarket Springs I'm going to

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.910 
aftermarket Springs I'm going to
reconfigure<00:02:51.709> these<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.560> I'm<00:02:57.620> going<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.830> put

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
reconfigure these so I'm going to put

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.699 
reconfigure these so I'm going to put
this<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.099> in<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.400> center<00:02:59.260> this<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.560> I'm<00:03:00.680> just

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
this one in the center this one I'm just

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:11.309 
this one in the center this one I'm just
going<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.069> move<00:03:01.250> over<00:03:02.890> one<00:03:03.890> notch<00:03:04.099> on<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> claw

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.900 

and<00:03:12.319> here<00:03:12.590> I'm<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.920> moving<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.310> ground<00:03:13.580> wire

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and here I'm just moving the ground wire

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.880 
and here I'm just moving the ground wire
over<00:03:14.630> that's<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.019> ground<00:03:15.290> for<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.650> bridge

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
over that's the ground for the bridge

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.830 
over that's the ground for the bridge
just<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.730> keep<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:17.000> out<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.269> way<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.510> does

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
just to keep it out of the way so does

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:29.250 
just to keep it out of the way so does
it<00:03:17.959> catch<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.380> spring

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.470 

now<00:03:30.099> that<00:03:30.280> I've<00:03:30.370> reconfigured<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.000> springs

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
now that I've reconfigured the springs

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.630 
now that I've reconfigured the springs
I'm<00:03:32.319> going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> tune<00:03:32.769> this<00:03:32.890> guitar<00:03:33.220> back<00:03:33.459> up

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
I'm going to tune this guitar back up

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.940 
I'm going to tune this guitar back up
the<00:03:33.760> pitch<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.299> see<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> bridge<00:03:35.319> moves<00:03:35.709> it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
the pitch and see if the bridge moves it

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.130 
the pitch and see if the bridge moves it
all<00:03:36.099> see<00:03:36.640> if<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.819> rolls<00:03:36.970> forward<00:03:37.390> or<00:03:37.690> if<00:03:37.989> it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
all see if it rolls forward or if it

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.520 
all see if it rolls forward or if it
remains<00:03:38.470> flush<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.069> body<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:44.170> appears

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
remains flush to the body it appears

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.699 
remains flush to the body it appears
it's<00:03:44.709> staying<00:03:44.980> relatively<00:03:45.610> flush<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:47.440> next

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
it's staying relatively flush the next

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.500 
it's staying relatively flush the next
step<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.160> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.519> be<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.760> raise<00:03:49.000> these<00:03:49.239> two

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
step is going to be to raise these two

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.170 
step is going to be to raise these two
posts<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.739> see<00:03:50.920> if<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.160> bridge<00:03:51.400> floats<00:03:51.849> at<00:03:52.030> all

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
posts to see if the bridge floats at all

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.440 
posts to see if the bridge floats at all
or<00:03:52.420> if<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.620> stays<00:03:53.830> flush<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> body<00:03:54.610> if<00:03:55.329> it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
or if it stays flush to the body if it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
or if it stays flush to the body if it
stays<00:03:55.660> flush<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.110> body<00:03:56.349> then<00:03:56.680> we<00:03:56.799> know<00:03:57.069> we

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
stays flush to the body then we know we

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.780 
stays flush to the body then we know we
need<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.030> readjust<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.690> claw<00:03:59.310> in<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> back<00:04:00.610> of

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
of turns to raise the overall bridge now

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.430 
of turns to raise the overall bridge now
as<00:04:18.459> with<00:04:18.669> any<00:04:19.060> adjustment<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.079> make<00:04:20.289> on

as with any adjustment that you make on

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.500 
as with any adjustment that you make on
a<00:04:20.470> guitar<00:04:20.970> every<00:04:21.970> time<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.210> make<00:04:22.389> an

adjustment

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.750 
adjustment
you<00:04:23.199> should<00:04:23.410> always<00:04:23.889> tune<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.280> back<00:04:24.400> up<00:04:24.610> to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
you should always tune it back up to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.659 
you should always tune it back up to
pitch<00:04:25.000> okay<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.229> now<00:04:26.560> we've<00:04:26.800> raised<00:04:27.340> these

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
pitch okay so now we've raised these

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.120 
pitch okay so now we've raised these
posts<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.150> little<00:04:28.360> bit<00:04:28.530> tune<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.650> back<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:30.010> to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
posts a little bit tune to back up to

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.490 
posts a little bit tune to back up to
pitch<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:31.360> yet<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.720> bridge<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.199> still

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
pitch but yet the bridge is still

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250 
pitch but yet the bridge is still
flushed<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> body<00:04:33.849> on<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.360> back<00:04:34.599> side<00:04:34.900> so

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
flushed to the body on the back side so

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.010 
flushed to the body on the back side so
that<00:04:36.070> tells<00:04:36.340> me<00:04:36.639> I<00:04:36.849> need<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.389> go<00:04:37.570> through<00:04:37.870> and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
that tells me I need to go through and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.600 
that tells me I need to go through and
readjust<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.740> claw<00:04:39.630> right<00:04:40.630> here<00:04:41.370> back<00:04:42.370> those

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
readjust the claw right here back those

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.430 
readjust the claw right here back those
screws<00:04:42.910> off<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> little<00:04:43.360> bit<00:04:43.570> take<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> little

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
screws off a little bit take a little

00:04:44.440 --> 00:05:04.709 
screws off a little bit take a little
bit<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.710> attention<00:04:45.160> off<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.310> springs

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.529 

now<00:05:05.649> that<00:05:05.889> I've<00:05:06.009> adjusted<00:05:06.159> the<00:05:06.580> claw<00:05:06.819> guess

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
now that I've adjusted the claw guess

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.449 
now that I've adjusted the claw guess
what<00:05:07.749> it's<00:05:08.379> time<00:05:08.619> to<00:05:08.739> tune<00:05:08.919> it<00:05:09.039> back<00:05:09.159> up<00:05:09.339> to

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:09.459 
what it's time to tune it back up to

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.969 
what it's time to tune it back up to
pitch<00:05:09.669> I'm<00:05:10.569> looking<00:05:11.019> to<00:05:11.110> see<00:05:11.289> just<00:05:11.679> how<00:05:11.769> much

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
pitch I'm looking to see just how much

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.639 
pitch I'm looking to see just how much
float<00:05:12.369> we<00:05:12.519> have<00:05:12.549> on<00:05:12.849> this<00:05:12.969> tremolo<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:13.869> quite

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:14.649 
float we have on this tremolo and quite

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.499 
float we have on this tremolo and quite
honestly<00:05:15.039> it<00:05:15.249> could<00:05:15.489> roll<00:05:15.759> forward<00:05:16.179> just<00:05:16.360> a

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
honestly it could roll forward just a

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.409 
honestly it could roll forward just a
little<00:05:17.019> bit<00:05:17.169> more<00:05:17.379> to<00:05:17.649> to<00:05:18.309> get<00:05:18.459> it<00:05:18.579> level<00:05:19.179> with

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
little bit more to to get it level with

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.719 
little bit more to to get it level with
the<00:05:19.539> body<00:05:21.389> plus<00:05:22.389> I<00:05:22.539> doubt<00:05:22.839> that<00:05:23.079> we<00:05:23.199> have<00:05:23.229> a

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
the body plus I doubt that we have a

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.059 
the body plus I doubt that we have a
half<00:05:24.729> step<00:05:25.029> draw<00:05:25.360> here<00:05:25.689> so<00:05:26.529> I'm<00:05:26.709> going<00:05:26.829> to<00:05:26.919> make

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
half step draw here so I'm going to make

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.699 
half step draw here so I'm going to make
a<00:05:27.099> few<00:05:27.279> more<00:05:27.459> adjustments<00:05:27.549> to<00:05:28.059> the<00:05:28.179> claw<00:05:28.709> see

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:29.709 
a few more adjustments to the claw see

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:31.139 
a few more adjustments to the claw see
if<00:05:29.829> I<00:05:29.919> can<00:05:30.039> get<00:05:30.189> this<00:05:30.339> to<00:05:30.519> roll<00:05:30.669> forward<00:05:30.969> a

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:31.149 
if I can get this to roll forward a

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:33.869 
if I can get this to roll forward a
little<00:05:31.269> bit<00:05:31.409> tune<00:05:32.409> it<00:05:32.529> to<00:05:32.559> pitch<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.519> see<00:05:33.729> what

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
little bit tune it to pitch and see what

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.850 
little bit tune it to pitch and see what
we're<00:05:34.029> at<00:05:36.569> so<00:05:37.569> here<00:05:37.869> I'm<00:05:37.989> just<00:05:38.259> backing<00:05:38.529> the

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
we're at so here I'm just backing the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.989 
we're at so here I'm just backing the
screws<00:05:39.189> off<00:05:39.429> a<00:05:39.699> little<00:05:40.449> bit<00:05:41.579> maybe<00:05:42.579> a<00:05:42.699> quarter

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:42.999 
screws off a little bit maybe a quarter

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.619 
screws off a little bit maybe a quarter
of<00:05:43.209> a<00:05:43.269> turn<00:05:43.479> or<00:05:43.689> so<00:05:45.119> then<00:05:46.119> I'm<00:05:46.239> going<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.479> turn

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
of a turn or so then I'm going to turn

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.719 
of a turn or so then I'm going to turn
it<00:05:46.779> back<00:05:46.809> up<00:05:46.929> to<00:05:47.229> pitch<00:05:47.439> and<00:05:47.800> see<00:05:48.429> if<00:05:48.550> that

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
it back up to pitch and see if that

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.269 
it back up to pitch and see if that
tremolo<00:05:49.659> is<00:05:49.779> floated<00:05:50.259> enough<00:05:50.829> to<00:05:51.039> get<00:05:51.159> that

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
tremolo is floated enough to get that

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.589 
tremolo is floated enough to get that
half<00:05:51.579> step<00:05:51.969> draw<00:05:52.949> so<00:05:53.949> at<00:05:54.099> this<00:05:54.249> point<00:05:54.599> we've

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
half step draw so at this point we've

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.899 
half step draw so at this point we've
readjusted<00:05:55.929> the<00:05:56.289> claw<00:05:56.529> several<00:05:57.219> times<00:05:57.519> and

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
readjusted the claw several times and

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.509 
readjusted the claw several times and
sometimes<00:05:58.689> it<00:05:58.899> takes<00:05:59.110> several<00:05:59.349> times<00:05:59.739> we've

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:00.519 
sometimes it takes several times we've

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:04.019 
sometimes it takes several times we've
retuned<00:06:01.059> the<00:06:01.119> guitar<00:06:01.559> right<00:06:02.559> now<00:06:02.769> the<00:06:03.759> trim

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
retuned the guitar right now the trim

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.509 
retuned the guitar right now the trim
looks<00:06:04.269> very<00:06:04.719> very<00:06:04.899> good<00:06:05.019> we've<00:06:05.829> got<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:06.189> just

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:06.519 
looks very very good we've got it just

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.129 
looks very very good we've got it just
to<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.699> right<00:06:06.819> position<00:06:07.029> I'm<00:06:07.659> going<00:06:07.839> to<00:06:07.929> check

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
to the right position I'm going to check

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.739 
to the right position I'm going to check
it<00:06:08.289> out<00:06:08.379> and<00:06:08.649> see<00:06:08.949> if<00:06:09.219> we<00:06:09.969> still<00:06:10.419> have<00:06:10.569> that

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749 
it out and see if we still have that

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:17.479 
it out and see if we still have that
half<00:06:11.319> step<00:06:11.649> draw<00:06:15.539> and<00:06:16.539> it<00:06:16.779> looks<00:06:16.989> pretty<00:06:17.199> good

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:17.489 
half step draw and it looks pretty good

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:20.069 
half step draw and it looks pretty good
the<00:06:18.489> next<00:06:18.789> step<00:06:18.999> is<00:06:19.239> going<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.599> be<00:06:19.659> to<00:06:19.839> lower

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:20.079 
the next step is going to be to lower

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.350 
the next step is going to be to lower
the<00:06:20.259> saddles<00:06:20.739> to<00:06:21.099> get<00:06:21.249> the<00:06:21.369> action<00:06:21.699> back<00:06:22.179> to

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
the saddles to get the action back to

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.299 
the saddles to get the action back to
where<00:06:22.479> it<00:06:22.539> was<00:06:22.689> before<00:06:22.899> since<00:06:23.739> we<00:06:23.889> did<00:06:24.099> raise

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:24.309 
where it was before since we did raise

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.179 
where it was before since we did raise
the<00:06:24.369> bridge<00:06:25.019> the<00:06:26.019> design<00:06:26.379> of<00:06:26.559> this<00:06:26.649> tremolo

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
the bridge the design of this tremolo

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:29.339 
the bridge the design of this tremolo
doesn't<00:06:27.699> allow<00:06:28.089> you<00:06:28.149> to<00:06:28.389> have<00:06:28.539> an<00:06:28.779> exactly

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
doesn't allow you to have an exactly

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.850 
doesn't allow you to have an exactly
uniform<00:06:30.149> half<00:06:31.149> step<00:06:31.539> draw<00:06:31.899> not<00:06:32.409> on<00:06:32.589> every

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
uniform half step draw not on every

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.159 
uniform half step draw not on every
string<00:06:33.189> but<00:06:33.849> you<00:06:33.969> can<00:06:34.089> get<00:06:34.209> awfully<00:06:34.539> close<00:06:34.839> and

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
string but you can get awfully close and

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.929 
string but you can get awfully close and
really<00:06:35.800> that's<00:06:36.069> about<00:06:36.219> the<00:06:36.459> best<00:06:36.639> you<00:06:36.789> can

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
really that's about the best you can

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.779 
really that's about the best you can
hope<00:06:37.089> for<00:06:37.149> on<00:06:37.539> this<00:06:37.809> type<00:06:38.199> of<00:06:38.229> tremolo<00:06:38.789> so

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
hope for on this type of tremolo so

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.329 
hope for on this type of tremolo so
using<00:06:40.179> a<00:06:40.269> hex<00:06:40.509> key<00:06:40.839> I'm<00:06:41.769> going<00:06:41.829> to<00:06:42.009> lower<00:06:42.159> the

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:42.339 
using a hex key I'm going to lower the

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.959 
using a hex key I'm going to lower the
action<00:06:42.759> here<00:06:43.239> at<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.629> bridge<00:06:43.839> saddles<00:06:44.909> try<00:06:45.909> to

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
action here at the bridge saddles try to

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.049 
action here at the bridge saddles try to
get<00:06:46.149> this<00:06:46.269> guitar<00:06:46.449> back<00:06:46.929> to<00:06:47.259> the<00:06:48.059> comfortable

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:49.059 
get this guitar back to the comfortable

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:53.579 
get this guitar back to the comfortable
action<00:06:49.389> it<00:06:49.479> was<00:06:49.629> before<00:06:51.119> keep<00:06:52.119> in<00:06:52.300> mind<00:06:52.589> that

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:53.589 
action it was before keep in mind that

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:55.889 
action it was before keep in mind that
not<00:06:53.860> all<00:06:54.129> strats<00:06:54.999> are<00:06:55.179> going<00:06:55.329> to<00:06:55.389> use<00:06:55.509> the<00:06:55.689> same

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:55.899 
not all strats are going to use the same

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.899 
not all strats are going to use the same
kind<00:06:56.229> of<00:06:56.349> tool<00:06:56.559> sometimes<00:06:57.129> it's<00:06:57.339> a<00:06:57.399> hex<00:06:57.610> key

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.809 
kind of tool sometimes it's a hex key
which<00:06:58.209> can<00:06:58.239> vary<00:06:58.689> in<00:06:58.839> size<00:06:59.079> or<00:06:59.679> they<00:07:00.519> could<00:07:00.789> be

which can vary in size or they could be

which can vary in size or they could be
a<00:07:00.969> flathead<00:07:01.419> screwdriver<00:07:03.779> next<00:07:04.779> we<00:07:05.019> had<00:07:05.139> to

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
a flathead screwdriver next we had to
