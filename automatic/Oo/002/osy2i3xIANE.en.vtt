I'm<00:00:50.460> excited<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.899> seems

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I'm excited for it is that it just seems

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
I'm excited for it is that it just seems
like<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> most<00:00:53.010> up-to-date<00:00:53.250> MMOs

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like when the most up-to-date MMOs

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
like when the most up-to-date MMOs
coming<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.559> offering<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
coming out and it's offering a lot of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
coming out and it's offering a lot of
new<00:00:57.109> aspects<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:59.270> hot<00:01:00.270> ball<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.750> instance

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
new aspects like hot ball for instance

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
new aspects like hot ball for instance
so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> haven't<00:01:01.649> even<00:01:01.859> played<00:01:02.219> any<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> these

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so I haven't even played any of these

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
so I haven't even played any of these
yet<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.439> really

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
yet but I think it's going to be really

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
yet but I think it's going to be really
interesting<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.640> teams<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.960> people

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
interesting to see just teams of people

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.570 
interesting to see just teams of people

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
can somewhat like pvp almost except in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
can somewhat like pvp almost except in
the<00:01:11.670> game<00:01:11.909> format<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.350> reason<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.979> like

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the game format and the reason I like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
the game format and the reason I like
that<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:16.320> something<00:01:16.590> that's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that is because I want something that's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.160 
that is because I want something that's
kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> game<00:01:18.330> inside<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> game

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
kind of like a game inside of the game

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
kind of like a game inside of the game
and<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:19.770> where<00:01:19.860> people<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and when where people can have a lot of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.969 
and when where people can have a lot of
fun<00:01:21.090> playing<00:01:21.360> together<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
fun playing together but can also be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
fun playing together but can also be

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
hoping that it gets to that level of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.710 
hoping that it gets to that level of
gameplay<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.770> people<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.280> enjoy<00:01:32.720> more

keeps me going about this game is the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
keeps me going about this game is the
fact<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.290> star<00:01:46.619> wars<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> an

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
fact that it is star wars and it is an

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
fact that it is star wars and it is an
MMO<00:01:48.090> both<00:01:48.450> things<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.079> really

interested in can't wait to see the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
interested in can't wait to see the
result<00:01:51.479> when<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> hopefully<00:01:52.710> i<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.280> into

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
result when I hopefully i make it into

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.530 
result when I hopefully i make it into
beta<00:01:53.700> testing<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> game<00:01:55.439> comes<00:01:55.680> out

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
to be a really big difference or how the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.230 
to be a really big difference or how the
personalities<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.040> guess<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> voices<00:02:19.210> are

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
personalities I guess of the voices are

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.870 
personalities I guess of the voices are
how<00:02:19.600> they<00:02:19.930> say<00:02:20.200> things<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.830> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.100> be<00:02:21.310> one

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
how they say things is going to be one

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.310 
how they say things is going to be one
of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.060> main<00:02:22.270> things<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.290> things

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
of the main things but one of the things

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.770 
of the main things but one of the things
that<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.070> makes<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:25.300> up<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.750> date

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
that I think makes it really up to date

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.200 
that I think makes it really up to date
is<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.230> fact<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.590> they're<00:02:27.030> including<00:02:28.030> like

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
is the fact that they're including like

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.270 
is the fact that they're including like
a<00:02:28.450> companion<00:02:29.320> system<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.160> guess

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
a companion system or so I guess

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.650 
a companion system or so I guess
something<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.820> will<00:02:30.910> keep<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.240> someone

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
something that will keep you someone

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.900 
something that will keep you someone

like friend if you want to call it that
another<00:02:45.970> way<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.180> think<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.630> up<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.960> date<00:02:47.470> is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
another way I think it's up to date is

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.700 
another way I think it's up to date is
the<00:02:47.770> fact<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.160> its<00:02:48.520> cinematic<00:02:49.360> combat<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.080> is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
the fact that its cinematic combat is is

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.520 
the fact that its cinematic combat is is
going<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.130> awesome<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.820> like<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.900> semi

cinematic<00:03:04.120> stuff<00:03:04.390> just<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.230> little

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
cinematic stuff just so it's a little

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.350 
cinematic stuff just so it's a little
bit<00:03:05.860> different<00:03:06.370> than<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.640> actual<00:03:06.850> gameplay

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
bit different than the actual gameplay

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.990 
bit different than the actual gameplay
like<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> same<00:03:08.890> thing<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.640> kind<00:03:09.940> of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
like it's the same thing but it kind of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.260 
like it's the same thing but it kind of
has<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.420> like<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> movie<00:03:10.990> format<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:12.790> can

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
has it in like a movie format and it can

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.790 
has it in like a movie format and it can
take<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.510> different<00:03:13.720> approach<00:03:13.990> than<00:03:14.260> just

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
take a different approach than just

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.190 
take a different approach than just
someone<00:03:15.280> behind<00:03:15.670> their<00:03:16.060> character<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.959> thing

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
someone behind their character the thing

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.930 
someone behind their character the thing
that's<00:03:17.410> that's<00:03:17.890> keeping<00:03:18.490> me<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.730> most

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
that's that's keeping me the most

plays out really well from what I've

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.480 
plays out really well from what I've
seen<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:28.450> lot<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.959> videos<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.800> when<00:03:30.370> it

classes like the Inquisitor and the Jedi

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.949 
classes like the Inquisitor and the Jedi
Knight<00:03:35.260> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.100> gives<00:03:36.340> an<00:03:36.640> even<00:03:37.300> edge<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
Knight kind of gives an even edge to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.220 
Knight kind of gives an even edge to
both<00:03:38.260> both<00:03:39.010> classes<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.910> that's<00:03:40.060> what<00:03:40.330> I've

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
both both classes and that's what I've

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.620 
both both classes and that's what I've
read<00:03:41.470> in<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.739> lot<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> bioware<00:03:42.820> updates<00:03:43.239> is<00:03:43.480> that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
read in a lot of bioware updates is that

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.540 
read in a lot of bioware updates is that
they're<00:03:43.780> trying<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.230> keep<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.739> force<00:03:45.070> users

they're trying to keep the force users

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290

Galaxies I know that at some points in
that<00:04:01.510> game<00:04:01.780> if<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.140> are<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.290> Jedi<00:04:02.650> then<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.100> can

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
that game if you are a Jedi then you can

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.790 
that game if you are a Jedi then you can
destroy<00:04:03.850> almost<00:04:04.209> anything<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.350> hopefully

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
destroy almost anything so hopefully

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.400 
destroy almost anything so hopefully
they<00:04:05.920> make<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.160> more<00:04:06.820> balanced<00:04:07.480> I'm<00:04:08.170> looking

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
they make a more balanced I'm looking

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.160 
they make a more balanced I'm looking
for<00:04:08.860> some<00:04:09.670> competition<00:04:10.630> rather<00:04:10.810> than<00:04:11.110> a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
for some competition rather than a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.979 
for some competition rather than a
full-on<00:04:11.920> beatdown<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.150> hopefully<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.660> turns

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
full-on beatdown so hopefully that turns

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.260 
full-on beatdown so hopefully that turns
out<00:04:14.230> really<00:04:14.590> well<00:04:14.850> definitely<00:04:15.850> for<00:04:16.000> sure<00:04:16.030> I'm

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
out really well definitely for sure I'm

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.599

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
think so far even though the game hasn't

rank<00:04:50.990> or<00:04:51.170> blue<00:04:51.410> rancor<00:04:51.890> feel<00:04:52.730> like<00:04:53.620> someone<00:04:54.620> of

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
rank or blue rancor feel like someone of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.210 
rank or blue rancor feel like someone of
like<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:55.480> secondary<00:04:56.770> friendship<00:04:57.770> or<00:04:58.040> something

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
like a secondary friendship or something

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.030 
like a secondary friendship or something
that'll<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.570> could<00:04:59.750> possibly<00:05:00.320> be<00:05:00.680> always

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040
