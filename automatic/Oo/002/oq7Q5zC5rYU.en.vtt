am going to show you about the two

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.709 
am going to show you about the two
octave<00:00:50.489> scales<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> am<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> show<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
octave scales and I am going to show you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.910 
octave scales and I am going to show you
how<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> play<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.590> basically

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
how to play them and basically

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369 
how to play them and basically
demonstrate<00:00:53.579> them<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> two<00:00:54.780> octave<00:00:54.960> scale

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
demonstrate them so a two octave scale

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
demonstrate them so a two octave scale
one<00:00:55.620> octave<00:00:55.949> scaler<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> eight<00:00:56.670> notes<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.270> two

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
one octave scaler is eight notes or two

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869 
one octave scaler is eight notes or two
octave<00:00:57.809> notes<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.559> octave<00:00:58.859> scale<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.340> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
octave notes a two octave scale is just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
octave notes a two octave scale is just
double<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.300> amount<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> nodes<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.199> two<00:01:01.559> octave

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
double the amount of nodes a two octave

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
double the amount of nodes a two octave
scale<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.789> double<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.840> one

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
scale is just double that over one

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
scale is just double that over one
octave<00:01:04.470> scale<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.790> some

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
octave scale but we have to do some

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
octave scale but we have to do some
slightly<00:01:06.270> different<00:01:06.390> fingering<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
slightly different fingering in the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
slightly different fingering in the
middle<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> work<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
middle just to make it work so as you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
middle just to make it work so as you
can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> blocked<00:01:11.040> off<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.729> first

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
can see here I blocked off the first

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
can see here I blocked off the first
scale<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.930> what<00:01:13.140> we've<00:01:13.290> been<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.590> been

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
scale or that what we've been just been

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
scale or that what we've been just been
doing<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> page<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> right

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
doing over the page but with the right

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
doing over the page but with the right
hand<00:01:16.110> instead<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> finishing<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> finger

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
hand instead of finishing with a finger

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.179 
hand instead of finishing with a finger
five<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> four

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
five we have to when we get to four

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
five we have to when we get to four
instead<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> putting<00:01:21.270> five<00:01:21.570> dome<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.140> then

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
instead of putting five dome we then

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
instead of putting five dome we then
tuck<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:23.040> thumb<00:01:23.340> under<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.570> us<00:01:24.720> ready<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tuck our thumb under to get us ready to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.090 
tuck our thumb under to get us ready to
start<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.740> new<00:01:25.770> octave<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> carry<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
start a new octave and then we carry on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
start a new octave and then we carry on
the<00:01:29.189> second<00:01:29.579> octave<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.119> normal<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.560> going

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the second octave as normal so I'm going

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
the second octave as normal so I'm going
to<00:01:31.770> start<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.159> playing<00:01:32.579> all<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.570> scales

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to start off by playing all the scales

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
to start off by playing all the scales
through<00:01:34.259> separate<00:01:35.040> hands<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.670> I'll

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
through separate hands and then I'll

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
through separate hands and then I'll
play<00:01:35.970> them<00:01:36.119> together<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.930> C<00:01:37.229> major

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
play them together so this is C major

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.980 
play them together so this is C major
scale

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.219 

tucking<00:01:41.990> under<00:01:43.509> tuck<00:01:44.509> under<00:01:44.810> again<00:01:45.049> it's

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
tucking under tuck under again it's

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.830 
tucking under tuck under again it's
normal<00:01:49.119> three<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.270> normal<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:53.420> take<00:01:53.630> us

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
normal three as normal for to take us

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.969 
normal three as normal for to take us
back<00:01:54.020> down<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.619> first<00:01:54.829> octave<00:01:56.830> three<00:01:57.830> as

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
back down to the first octave three as

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.870 
back down to the first octave three as
normal<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.649> when<00:02:00.830> you're<00:02:00.979> doing<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.429> normal

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
normal so when you're doing a normal

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.149 
normal so when you're doing a normal
scale<00:02:02.240> which<00:02:02.869> would<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.140> here<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.009> your

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
scale which would be here and then your

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.950 
scale which would be here and then your
second<00:02:04.490> octave<00:02:04.759> scale<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.179> here<00:02:05.450> you're

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
second octave scale is here you're

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.690 
second octave scale is here you're
tucking<00:02:06.200> under<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.979> crossing<00:02:07.369> over<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
tucking under the and crossing over the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.790 
tucking under the and crossing over the
three<00:02:08.000> as<00:02:08.119> usual<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.500> fall<00:02:09.769> comes

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
three as usual but when the fall comes

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.009 
three as usual but when the fall comes
in<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.429> when<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.700> want<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> take<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.510> from<00:02:11.690> one

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
in is when you want to take it from one

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.890 
in is when you want to take it from one
octave<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.100> next<00:02:13.519> octave<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.540> area

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
octave to the next octave so this area

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.330 
octave to the next octave so this area
here<00:02:15.200> which<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:15.650> I'm<00:02:15.709> trying<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.010> explain

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
here which is what I'm trying to explain

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880 
here which is what I'm trying to explain
in<00:02:16.489> here<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.630> kind<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.930> crossover<00:02:18.350> section

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
in here is the kind of crossover section

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.620 
in here is the kind of crossover section
between<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.310> end<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> first<00:02:20.030> octave<00:02:20.480> and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
between the end of the first octave and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
between the end of the first octave and
the<00:02:20.840> beginning<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> second<00:02:21.980> octave

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the beginning of the second octave

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.820 
the beginning of the second octave
that's<00:02:22.910> where<00:02:23.209> fall<00:02:23.569> comes<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.680> when

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's where fall comes in so when

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.949 
that's where fall comes in so when
you're<00:02:24.950> doing<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.160> normal<00:02:25.370> scale<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.630> always

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
you're doing a normal scale it's always

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.210 
you're doing a normal scale it's always
tucking<00:02:27.440> under<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:29.230> crossing<00:02:30.230> over<00:02:30.380> three<00:02:30.980> if

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
tucking under and crossing over three if

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.280 
tucking under and crossing over three if
you<00:02:31.640> want<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.000> make<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.480> from<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.750> one<00:02:33.140> octave

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
you want to make it from a one octave

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.500 
you want to make it from a one octave
scale<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> two<00:02:34.310> octave<00:02:34.670> scale<00:02:34.940> then<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
scale to a two octave scale then you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.780 
scale to a two octave scale then you
have<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> tuck<00:02:36.170> under<00:02:36.380> four<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.190> obviously<00:02:37.670> on

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
have to tuck under four and obviously on

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.120 
have to tuck under four and obviously on
the<00:02:37.880> way<00:02:38.000> back<00:02:38.180> down<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.930> cross<00:02:39.290> over<00:02:39.560> four

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
the way back down you cross over four

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.970 
the way back down you cross over four
I'm<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.180> left<00:02:41.330> hand

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.490 

so<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.760> make<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.150> into<00:02:47.420> another<00:02:47.720> octave<00:02:48.200> that's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
so to make it into another octave that's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.280 
so to make it into another octave that's
where<00:02:48.710> four<00:02:49.040> comes<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:52.540> top<00:02:53.540> under<00:02:53.840> three<00:02:54.140> as

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
where four comes in top under three as

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.730 
where four comes in top under three as
usual<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.390> need<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.690> go<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.900> another<00:02:57.290> octave

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
usual so I need to go to another octave

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.210 
usual so I need to go to another octave
so<00:02:58.040> I'm<00:02:58.220> going<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.370> type<00:02:58.550> my<00:02:58.580> thumb<00:02:58.940> under
