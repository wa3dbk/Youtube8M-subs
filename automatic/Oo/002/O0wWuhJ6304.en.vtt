hello guys and welcome back to teen team

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
hello guys and welcome back to teen team
madness<00:00:10.260> today<00:00:10.620> I'm<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.370> showing

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
madness today I'm going to be showing

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
madness today I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:11.969> something<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:12.960> really<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> tnt

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
you something that is not really a tnt

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.250 
you something that is not really a tnt
cannon<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.849> something<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> call<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
cannon but something I like to call the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920 
cannon but something I like to call the
compact<00:00:16.770> invisible<00:00:17.430> bomb<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.660> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
compact invisible bomb so what this is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
compact invisible bomb so what this is
if<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.439> get<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> mean<00:00:19.949> by<00:00:20.310> an

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
if you don't get what I mean by an

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
if you don't get what I mean by an
invisible<00:00:20.580> bomb<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> blows<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.260> lots

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
invisible bomb is that it blows up lots

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130 
invisible bomb is that it blows up lots
of<00:00:23.039> TNT<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:23.910> doesn't<00:00:24.210> destroy<00:00:24.539> anything<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of TNT but doesn't destroy anything and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.540 
of TNT but doesn't destroy anything and
when<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.680> from<00:00:25.830> look<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
when you go from look at it from a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.580 
when you go from look at it from a
distance<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> can't<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.630> anything<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
distance you can't see anything and the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
distance you can't see anything and the
reason<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:29.220> has<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.730> compact<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
reason it has to be compact is so that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.650 
reason it has to be compact is so that
the<00:00:31.529> cloud<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.040> surround<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.420> we

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the cloud can surround it all so if we

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
the cloud can surround it all so if we
select<00:00:34.050> us<00:00:34.290> leave<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:35.100> away<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
select us leave that and go away a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
select us leave that and go away a
little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> TNT<00:00:36.719> gets

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
little bit we can see the TNT gets

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.360 
little bit we can see the TNT gets
dispensed<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> they'll<00:00:37.890> create<00:00:38.070> an

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
dispensed and they'll create an

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.930 
dispensed and they'll create an
explosion<00:00:38.969> where<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.239> can't<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.570> anything<00:00:40.940> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
explosion where we can't see anything as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
explosion where we can't see anything as
you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.320> around<00:00:43.440> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you can see even if you go around you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
you can see even if you go around you
can't<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> single<00:00:44.670> block<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:46.020> just

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can't see a single block and it's just

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.040 
can't see a single block and it's just
tons<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> tons<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.980> TNT

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.660 

so<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.440> can<00:00:54.530> see<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:55.010> creates<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.399> lot<00:00:55.640> of

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
so as you can see that creates a lot of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.850 
so as you can see that creates a lot of
noise<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:56.180> news<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.510> quite<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.720> bit<00:00:56.930> 10<00:00:57.110> D<00:00:57.290> this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
noise the news is quite a bit 10 D this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.400 
noise the news is quite a bit 10 D this
can<00:00:58.190> last<00:00:58.370> for<00:00:59.239> quite<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.690> whiie<00:00:59.870> well<00:01:00.079> as<00:01:00.320> you

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
can last for quite a whiie well as you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.080 
can last for quite a whiie well as you
can<00:01:00.530> see<00:01:00.710> used<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.280> weave<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.610> tea<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:01.910> tea<00:01:02.059> I

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
can see used to weave in a tea and tea I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.540 
can see used to weave in a tea and tea I
alone<00:01:02.600> shall<00:01:02.870> weave<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.199> before<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.190> this

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
alone shall weave it before so this

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.710 
alone shall weave it before so this
could<00:01:04.729> last<00:01:04.909> for<00:01:05.210> about<00:01:05.300> two<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.690> three

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
could last for about two to three

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.050 
could last for about two to three
minutes<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:06.800> walk<00:01:07.159> away<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.760> tricky

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
minutes so you just walk away in tricky

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030 
minutes so you just walk away in tricky
friends<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.869> peace<00:01:09.080> part<00:01:09.350> about<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.770> is

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
friends and the peace part about this is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.400 
friends and the peace part about this is
if<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.490> are<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:11.000> v<00:01:11.330> mode<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.020> on<00:01:12.110> traits<00:01:12.320> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
if you are in v mode and so on traits to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.499 
if you are in v mode and so on traits to
walk<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.860> them<00:01:13.040> walk<00:01:13.610> up<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.000> if<00:01:14.180> they<00:01:14.330> go

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
walk up to them walk up to it if they go

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.810 
walk up to them walk up to it if they go
anywhere<00:01:15.350> near<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.830> they<00:01:16.040> will<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.369> die<00:01:16.520> it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
anywhere near it they will just die it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.850 
anywhere near it they will just die it
works<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.300> same<00:01:17.330> as<00:01:17.630> normal<00:01:17.840> TNT<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.470> just

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
works the same as normal TNT it just

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.950 
works the same as normal TNT it just
doesn't<00:01:19.040> blow<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:19.460> anything<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.940> also<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
doesn't blow up anything and also the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.570 
doesn't blow up anything and also the
reason<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> slab<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:21.890> up<00:01:22.009> here<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.430> not

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
reason the slab is up here and not

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.100 
reason the slab is up here and not
directly<00:01:22.759> over<00:01:23.060> top<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.509> is<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:23.960> makes

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
directly over top of it is so it makes

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.620 
directly over top of it is so it makes
it<00:01:24.259> easier<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.619> refill<00:01:25.130> all<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.759> TNT<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.420> you

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
it easier to refill all the TNT and you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.910 
it easier to refill all the TNT and you
and<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.080> can<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:27.410> what's<00:01:27.619> happening

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and you can see what's happening

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.950 
and you can see what's happening
underneath<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.880> another<00:01:29.240> thing<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.690> if

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
underneath so another thing is if

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.389 
underneath so another thing is if
someone<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.440> looking<00:01:30.649> at<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.009> from<00:01:31.039> underneath

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
someone is looking at it from underneath

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.969 
someone is looking at it from underneath
it's<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.060> slab<00:01:32.330> here<00:01:32.680> just<00:01:33.680> leave<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
it's just a slab here just leave the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.680 
it's just a slab here just leave the
little<00:01:34.190> things<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.670> save<00:01:34.910> space<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.660> only

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
little things to save space the only

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.270 
little things to save space the only
really<00:01:36.170> thing<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.530> sticks<00:01:36.830> out<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.250> just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
really thing that sticks out is just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.389 
really thing that sticks out is just
leave<00:01:37.880> earlier<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.140> anyway<00:01:39.560> now<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.310> the
