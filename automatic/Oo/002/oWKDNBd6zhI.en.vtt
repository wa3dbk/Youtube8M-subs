00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.140
 this year 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 quit afp 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.250
 and all the actions he undertakes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.730
 no and in putting 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.489
 this comes the manuals the auditors come 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.199
 the thing was common that tivo flowing that series in that era of change 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.449
 I'm very interested in technology 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.580
 the action of change because it is the moment in which many companies 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.020
 that a total success with total failure not at that time the change had 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.580
 competitors positioned in your same area 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.030
 there were always incipient competitors 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.120
 but 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.729
 as in the market in that power players want 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.129
 nea I do not have it very present I was always graves is doing the 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.980
 transit in commercial form 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.560
 that for me it was always a system 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.220
 obsolete I love you foxhole everything to do 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.940
 40 in brazil apes was remarkable donated by as much as possible you are seeing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.300
 connect both 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.640
 notices consolidated 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.160
 ban has allowed me to dissent but good keep flowing since I had in the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.520
 topic let's see this I have a lot of respect because the information 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.660
 information incorporates training in front of everyone 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.280
 the circ to ask the interested party how is he does not seem not to me 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 it looks more than 60 mm from oslo and more exactly and the information in 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.840
 reality what you help to transparent markets 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 to which markets are more transparent more maskin more competitive more 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 transparent more competitive of the tec 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 that's why you say love for information 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.320
 what he did was transform 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.560
 something that worked well 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.730
 computerized faster I do not know if you have garbage 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.250
 riders computing what you have a lot more trash faster 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.980
 if you have a moderately settled system and working correctly, 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.920
 incorporates technology and what is faster we look at computing what 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.770
 what does he do 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.690
 accelerate and facilitate 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.360
 if you have something that works bad probably the rap and the mind you give 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.310
 account and do in the process 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.470
 d really stressed that it does not work 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.800
 close to if you have something moderately accepted this technological change was 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.100
 a wonder the most fat 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.569
 we stand in front of the printer 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.200
 as a cow looking at passing a small train one in the first report waits 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.810
 strengthen an unusual thing yoma as the first drive that was a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.149
 unit of 25 media let's locate 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.419
 and this I could not believe how they can have such information a 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.089
 disco I think the largest size a refrigerator that had 25 half gabriel 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.469
 strap with the 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.559
 This history is already lived if it were to return to the moment of 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.939
 decision of your incorporation of the company 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.539
 arias that 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 oto mary a different path daily a venture 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.809
 that was not continuation 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.779
 of an existing 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.279
 iranzo the work that costs me that question essentially because i think that 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:52.339
 when someone 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.079
 reach a certain age 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.790
 says that would do exactly the same thing they were called or mature as the last ones 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.829
 30 years old you saw the divine button this one does that should answer that 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.179
 there are different things but clearly not only because 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:10.429
 this shot that the processes that were given were the processes according to the 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.509
 moments of were distance housing family 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.550
 let's see us for example driving we can do 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.270
 this is an advertising development because the information had no way 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.719
 to advertise 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.859
 then we generate a foundation 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.839
 that allowed us to spread and that we were doing through 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:33.329
 congresses etc. then we even found a way to spread without 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.399
 need 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.689
 d invest in advertising 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.980
 but we are advertising we advertise our has communicated to 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.439
 Greece exactly 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.069
 Well this is very difficult to say what equipment 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.589
 I did not want any different 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.169
 probably there would not be any no camps against the first center 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.609
 of that brand's computation 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.040
 but a much more advanced brand 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.100
 likely that the second center computations 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 my life has gone to an open systems that at that time only the incipient 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.689
 and then he did not give us the courage to do it 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.930
 it is very easy with the rear view mirror of pere that what happened 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.489
 patras 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.680
 6 but anyway it seems that sometimes the exercise 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.159
 not so much for you yes no 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.810
 for others not for example in the year 94 I think the important event 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.509
 What is it 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.739
 the link with banelco 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.370
 ee that decision because you take 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.300
 I had to produce a cultural change at that time 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.469
 let's see you had to start exchanging information 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.559
 and masters later they had to exchange information with a with visa 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.630
 the city has to change and information with the boston 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.629
 the river with the galicia is 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:44.169
 staunch competitor is well that will deliver its client portfolio i this 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.699
 that live in the same place 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.259
 to do that I could take 50 years twenty years 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.099
 crushing crushing crushing today incorporates salaries directly 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.300
 but in addition to that 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.680
 he called as everything that was America was not good 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.630
 this is 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.039
 at that time we are talking about the 80's first eighties prince the 90's 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.650
 then I went out to find which ones were the most important in states 

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:11.259
 United 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.339
 there are three 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.599
 and obviously 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.680
 I chose 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.259
 to direct me 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.370
 this the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.630
 the number one that ended up being kofax 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.120
 that is currently the owner of that sack as being how you choose to 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.259
 they choose you 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.789
 when I went to address this framework said that the first meeting we had 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.180
 full and expertise a hyperinflation Belize Juan and how much does it cost 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.199
 query in your base gives truce what time 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.379
 then he looks at me hard for how you explain to a gringo 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:42.589
 in atlanta 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.439
 what is inter inflation but that always took new notes of a 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.210
 weight 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.979
 and he explained that this in year 57 and more than a million dollars 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.379
 and that they have not succeeded and it can be left on top of gifts 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.050
 carpio differentiation not so that they understand a little what nor france 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.379
 it is very difficult for that reason also as great business failures 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.960
 when companies in america not only peas disembarked in argentina with a 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.210
 assistance 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.610
 villa 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.630
 quit afp
