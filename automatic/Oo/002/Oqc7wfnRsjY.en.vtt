and we won the whole thing and you know

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.830 
and we won the whole thing and you know
I<00:00:49.649> came<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> being<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> top

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
