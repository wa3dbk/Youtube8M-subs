00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
eyes counteracting any darkness and then

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
yellowy and which I can imagine is just

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.850 
yellowy and which I can imagine is just
going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.120> even<00:02:59.570> out<00:02:59.630> any<00:02:59.840> redness<00:03:00.170> really

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to even out any redness really

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.229 
going to even out any redness really
nicely<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> skin<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:01.820> I'm<00:03:01.910> really<00:03:02.120> excited

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.370 
to give that a go I think because it is
in<00:03:05.000> such<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> cute<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.660> compact<00:03:06.080> it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
in such a cute little compact it's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.900 
in such a cute little compact it's
probably<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.830> be<00:03:06.890> one<00:03:07.100> though<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.670> just

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
probably going to be one though I just

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.550 
probably going to be one though I just
slip<00:03:08.060> into<00:03:08.239> my<00:03:08.360> handbag<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> used<00:03:09.410> for

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
slip into my handbag and used for

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.140 
slip into my handbag and used for
touch-ups<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> go<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.520> can<00:03:10.820> imagine<00:03:10.970> that

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
touch-ups on the go I can imagine that

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
touch-ups on the go I can imagine that
being<00:03:11.780> perfect<00:03:12.380> moving<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.220> fragrance

being perfect moving on to fragrance

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.100 
being perfect moving on to fragrance
which<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.239> guess<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.600> probably<00:03:14.690> goes<00:03:14.959> without

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
which I guess it probably goes without

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.740

amplified<00:05:38.289> lipsticks<00:05:38.770> before<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.759> I<00:05:39.789> just

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
amplified lipsticks before so I just

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.339 
amplified lipsticks before so I just
feel<00:05:40.180> as<00:05:40.360> though<00:05:40.449> it's<00:05:40.690> going<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.900> be<00:05:40.990> similar

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
feel as though it's going to be similar

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.689 
feel as though it's going to be similar
to<00:05:41.380> twig<00:05:41.710> but<00:05:41.979> hopefully<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.400> little<00:05:42.520> bit

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
to twig but hopefully a little bit

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.459 
to twig but hopefully a little bit
bolder<00:05:43.150> hopefully<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.870> will<00:05:43.930> last<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.320> little

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
bolder hopefully it will last a little

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.689 
bolder hopefully it will last a little
bit<00:05:44.560> longer<00:05:44.800> on<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.099> lips<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.550> would

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
bit longer on the lips I would

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.399 
bit longer on the lips I would
definitely<00:05:45.820> give<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.570> go<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.110> I<00:05:47.320> will

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
definitely give this a go and I will

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.439 
definitely give this a go and I will
insert<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.740> clip<00:05:48.009> of<00:05:48.219> swell<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:48.820> me<00:05:49.000> trying<00:05:49.240> it

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
insert a clip of swell of me trying it

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.730 
insert a clip of swell of me trying it
here<00:05:49.659> so<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.139> see<00:05:50.259> what<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.440> looks<00:05:50.469> like

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
here so you can see what it looks like

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.439 
here so you can see what it looks like
on<00:05:50.889> the<00:05:50.949> lips<00:05:51.219> I<00:05:51.430> just<00:05:51.909> think<00:05:52.030> that's<00:05:52.210> really

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
on the lips I just think that's really

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.379 
on the lips I just think that's really
pretty<00:05:52.599> and<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.500> think<00:05:53.770> that<00:05:54.009> cost<00:05:54.250> 13<00:05:55.090> pound

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
pretty and I think that cost 13 pound

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.320 
pretty and I think that cost 13 pound
fifty<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:56.080> mac<00:05:56.949> lipsticks<00:05:57.400> now<00:05:57.639> I<00:05:57.669> think<00:05:57.940> I'm

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
fifty and mac lipsticks now I think I'm

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.830 
fifty and mac lipsticks now I think I'm
up<00:05:58.449> to<00:05:58.479> 1550<00:05:59.610> in<00:06:00.610> that<00:06:00.909> counters<00:06:01.389> and<00:06:01.570> whatever

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
up to 1550 in that counters and whatever

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.659 
up to 1550 in that counters and whatever
so<00:06:02.169> it's<00:06:02.710> definitely<00:06:03.039> a<00:06:03.130> little<00:06:03.310> bit<00:06:03.550> of<00:06:03.610> a

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
so it's definitely a little bit of a

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.089 
so it's definitely a little bit of a
bargain<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.360> if<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:04.780> are<00:06:04.960> interested<00:06:05.440> in<00:06:05.710> the

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
bargain and if you are interested in the
