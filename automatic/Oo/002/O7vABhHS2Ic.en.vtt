00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
I just wanted to clear up a little bit

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.090 
I just wanted to clear up a little bit
of<00:00:03.889> confusion<00:00:04.400> on<00:00:04.819> my<00:00:05.030> toilet<00:00:05.870> paper<00:00:06.170> holder

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
of confusion on my toilet paper holder

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.369 
of confusion on my toilet paper holder
that<00:00:07.550> I<00:00:07.700> left<00:00:07.910> out<00:00:08.090> of<00:00:08.120> my<00:00:08.330> videos<00:00:08.690> I<00:00:09.080> only

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
that I left out of my videos I only

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.230 
that I left out of my videos I only
needed<00:00:09.589> a<00:00:09.799> half<00:00:10.009> second<00:00:10.490> shot<00:00:10.759> and<00:00:10.999> it<00:00:11.120> would

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
needed a half second shot and it would

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.569 
needed a half second shot and it would
have<00:00:11.329> made<00:00:11.480> it<00:00:11.599> all<00:00:11.780> clear<00:00:12.349> as<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:12.889> this<00:00:13.429> is

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:13.579 
have made it all clear as to this is

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.150 
have made it all clear as to this is
what<00:00:13.730> I<00:00:13.759> use<00:00:13.999> it's<00:00:14.240> just<00:00:14.450> one<00:00:14.599> of<00:00:14.690> those<00:00:14.780> little

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
what I use it's just one of those little

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.180 
what I use it's just one of those little
store-bought<00:00:16.660> spring-loaded<00:00:17.660> jobs<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:18.950> so

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
store-bought spring-loaded jobs and so

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.180 
store-bought spring-loaded jobs and so
well<00:00:20.000> it'll<00:00:20.630> set<00:00:21.020> in<00:00:21.170> like<00:00:21.350> that<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.770> the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
well it'll set in like that and the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.520 
well it'll set in like that and the
holes<00:00:22.430> that<00:00:22.610> I<00:00:22.700> made<00:00:22.940> obviously<00:00:23.450> are<00:00:23.690> for<00:00:24.200> this

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
holes that I made obviously are for this

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.930 
holes that I made obviously are for this
size<00:00:24.800> they're<00:00:25.010> kind<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.190> different<00:00:25.370> sizes<00:00:25.640> so

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
size they're kind of different sizes so

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.130 
size they're kind of different sizes so
you<00:00:25.970> have<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.270> make<00:00:26.390> your<00:00:26.480> holes<00:00:26.720> differently

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
you have to make your holes differently

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.220 
you have to make your holes differently
and<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:27.830> then<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.610> just<00:00:28.790> squeezes<00:00:29.240> in<00:00:29.450> like

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
and so then it just squeezes in like

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.720 
and so then it just squeezes in like
that<00:00:30.820> that's<00:00:31.820> all<00:00:32.000> it<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:36.310> well<00:00:37.310> I'm<00:00:37.370> trying<00:00:37.550> to

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
that that's all it is well I'm trying to

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.100 
that that's all it is well I'm trying to
dip<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.940> whole<00:00:38.300> bunch<00:00:38.510> of<00:00:38.630> different<00:00:38.900> ways<00:00:39.079> to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
dip a whole bunch of different ways to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.620 
dip a whole bunch of different ways to
get<00:00:39.440> this<00:00:39.650> old<00:00:39.920> blazing<00:00:40.850> out<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.180> here<00:00:41.450> this

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
get this old blazing out of here this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.530 
get this old blazing out of here this
was<00:00:42.170> put<00:00:42.470> in<00:00:42.590> in<00:00:42.770> 1955<00:00:43.760> when<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.060> house<00:00:44.300> was

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
was put in in 1955 when the house was

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.750 
was put in in 1955 when the house was
built<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:45.739> like<00:00:45.920> concrete<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.670> it's

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
built so it's like concrete and it's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.830 
built so it's like concrete and it's
really<00:00:46.970> hard<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.270> get<00:00:47.450> out<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.690> there<00:00:47.780> I've

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
really hard to get out of there I've

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.810 
really hard to get out of there I've
tried<00:00:48.050> chisel<00:00:48.530> I've<00:00:48.710> tried<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.340> stiff

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
tried chisel I've tried you know a stiff

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.620 
tried chisel I've tried you know a stiff
putty<00:00:50.270> knife

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
putty knife

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.380 
putty knife
I<00:00:50.840> even<00:00:51.110> tried<00:00:51.320> my<00:00:51.560> dremel<00:00:52.010> tool<00:00:52.250> but<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.239> think

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
I even tried my dremel tool but I think

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.810 
I even tried my dremel tool but I think
it's<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> lot<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.690> hard<00:00:53.930> just<00:00:54.559> labor<00:00:55.250> getting<00:00:55.730> it

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
it's a lot of hard just labor getting it

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.450 
it's a lot of hard just labor getting it
out<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.329> problem<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.050> when<00:00:57.140> I'm<00:00:57.460> punching

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
out the problem is is when I'm punching

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.790 
out the problem is is when I'm punching
this<00:00:58.579> out<00:00:58.820> it's<00:00:59.120> actually<00:00:59.480> breaking<00:01:00.440> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
this out it's actually breaking this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.299 
this out it's actually breaking this
glass<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:01.489> kind<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.120> mangling<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:03.590> this

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
glass it's kind of mangling it so this

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.370 
glass it's kind of mangling it so this
is<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.579> hard<00:01:04.759> part<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:05.900> see<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.200> is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
is the hard part if you can see this is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440 
is the hard part if you can see this is
all<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.710> old<00:01:06.950> glazing<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:07.970> there<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:08.270> mean

all that old glazing in there I mean
it's<00:01:08.630> just<00:01:08.690> as<00:01:08.930> hard<00:01:09.229> as<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.560> rock<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:11.180> is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
it's just as hard as a rock and this is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.969 
it's just as hard as a rock and this is
where<00:01:11.479> I've<00:01:11.600> been<00:01:11.690> chipping<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.290> away<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.830> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979

know the glass is just falling up so
yeah<00:01:17.720> one<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.080> joys<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.440> having<00:01:18.590> an<00:01:18.799> old

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010

yeah one of the joys of having an old
house<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.240> think<00:01:20.479> when<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.630> replace<00:01:20.960> this

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
house but I think when I replace this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.340 
house but I think when I replace this
I'm<00:01:21.830> gonna<00:01:22.040> use<00:01:22.130> lead<00:01:22.820> paint<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.450> seal<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.229> off

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
I'm gonna use lead paint and seal it off

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.080 
I'm gonna use lead paint and seal it off
with<00:01:24.560> some<00:01:24.799> asbestos<00:01:24.979> too

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
