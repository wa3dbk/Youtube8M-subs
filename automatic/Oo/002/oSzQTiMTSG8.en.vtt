smoothly<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:14.009> seems<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.670> extremely

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
smoothly it all seems to be extremely

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.240 
smoothly it all seems to be extremely
painful<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.560> keep<00:00:16.740> saying<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
painful and they all keep saying it's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.849 
painful and they all keep saying it's
the<00:00:17.430> worst<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.940> they've<00:00:18.090> done<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.800> I'm<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the worst one they've done so I'm a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.450 
the worst one they've done so I'm a
little<00:00:20.699> nervous<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:22.710> well

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
little nervous and as you can see well

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.310 
little nervous and as you can see well
this<00:00:23.609> one's<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.000> pretty<00:00:24.570> much<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.720> 1<00:00:24.930> gage<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
this one's like pretty much a 1 gage I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.750 
this one's like pretty much a 1 gage I
made<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.890> myself<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.490> make<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
made this one myself just make it a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
made this one myself just make it a
little<00:00:26.880> bit<00:00:27.000> bigger<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
little bit bigger this one this is the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.130 
little bit bigger this one this is the
gage<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.480> only<00:00:30.630> get<00:00:30.779> halfway<00:00:30.960> through

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
gage that I can only get halfway through

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
gage that I can only get halfway through
right<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.859> I've<00:00:32.340> left<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
right now but I've left it like that so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.330 
right now but I've left it like that so
that<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.079> hopefully<00:00:34.440> it'll<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> little

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that way hopefully it'll be a little

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.930 
that way hopefully it'll be a little
easier<00:00:35.640> once<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.630> push<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> through

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
easier once I actually push it through

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
easier once I actually push it through
