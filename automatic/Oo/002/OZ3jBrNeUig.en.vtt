us<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.220> little<00:04:14.400> maybe<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.880> makes<00:04:15.060> long<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.620> make

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
us a little maybe it makes long so make

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.970 
us a little maybe it makes long so make
the<00:04:17.489> lower<00:04:17.670> back<00:04:17.850> at<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.799> fortunately<00:04:19.799> i'm

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
the lower back at and fortunately i'm

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.280 
the lower back at and fortunately i'm
just<00:04:20.420> looking<00:04:21.420> over<00:04:21.570> these<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.109> give<00:04:22.260> it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
just looking over these you can give it

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.560 
just looking over these you can give it
away<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.700> not<00:04:23.940> pass<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.420> ball<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:26.570> this
