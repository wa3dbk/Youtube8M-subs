00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.610
 welcome to the fifth video tutorial of the window but half budget 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.589
 in the let's show 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.709
 how to budget parallel windows 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.550
 they are included in the ten parallel folder 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.019
 and divided into three groups 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.029
 and three leaves 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.909
 it is very important to take into account the number of sheets e / f and always the 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:27.679
 number of sheets 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:28.810
 of paradela 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 for example this model 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.240
 a parallel eye and annoying practicable 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.690
 but they are stealing within the group of one 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.629
 let's use one of the most usual 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.629
 which is a sheet with fixed side 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 to modify the openings in the parallel 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 we have to use horizontal reflection 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.930
 we accept the default routes 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.130
 we change the color to noval like the rest of the budget 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.540
 we go active with blinds 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.480
 or modify laws 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.140
 and we do not go to the options tab 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.290
 Within the options we have to take into account a series of things 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.330
 for example that the couple has to carry 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.800
 oviedo that I do is inferior 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.610
 omar puenzo thousand 402 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.640
 simply that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.920
 because the interest lanes of the parallel 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310
 they protrude slightly over the frame 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.439
 and for a better performance and we practice that a little bit of band 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.430
 inside the leaves 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.780
 in the shovel we can use the asset types of 98 by the intermediate 15 97 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.830
 it is very important to take into account 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.610
 the size of the leaves 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 when selecting the type of stick to use 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 finally the panela are quite large size 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.980
 it is usually more common to use the 15 98 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.400
 inside the fittings 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.090
 handcuffs 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.490
 to select the mania we would go to the point if the parallel 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.750
 and we have two possibilities 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 in case the parallel that followed Maria inland 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.590
 or if you pay with lock 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.600
 let's use I own for the conservative 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.810
 that would be an interior handle a flat outer mary 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.469
 obligatorily 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.340
 and a bowler hat for blocking the movement of the cremona 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340
 colo colo that we will open the device 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.969
 depending on the type of handle 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.289
 known with the morning may but for we can have it 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.499
 handles white black greenish silver 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.699
 in case of asylum for the conservative 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.630
 it is reduced they speak with ebro to the serene val 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.630
 we select 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.499
 we have chosen a lock 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.150
 and therefore we have to put a kind of light bulb for this case would be a 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.059
 double-sided bulb 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.859
 in case of dengue forgetting not selectable when I accepted maternal 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:48.979
 Mary incompatible 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.159
 simply the error will be accepted ' 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.649
 came kind of light bulb and put it 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.559
 there are two kinds 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.949
 parallel leisure with heras and automatic opone manual rage 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.959
 by default usually the automatic is usually used 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.959
 easier to operate and more in large sizes 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.969
 although you could also leave the manual 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.509
 hoa and certain cases in which the hardware 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:13.879
 automatic 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.860
 percent exceeds the amerian minimum 15 years that mandatorily uses the 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:18.579
 manual 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.109
 in these cases 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.599
 the program will indicate the recommendation 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.689
 to place automatic hardware in those that in field respect with manual 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.889
 It will indicate that you must necessarily carry manual rage in those 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.889
 that are small 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.499
 since we have placed 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:38.549
 a monoblock 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.659
 with yellow on the outside 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.969
 we have to put a guide of mosquito nets to give us a section 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.319
 enough so that the suitcase does not get caught in the handle 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.659
 we accept 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.299
 nerva supply arise a message n that tells us that the series of 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.969
 people in front to be able to mount the drawer 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.109
 is a section of 58 usually this is not necessary but in the case of 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:02.809
 parallel 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.439
 by the upper lanes 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.839
 we do not have enough space to place the tape output 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.149
 that's why you have to take it into account when we put together parallels 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.539
 with other windows that the mosquito net for example practicable 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.120
 in the corner, it will have a front ribbon outlet and two the interior iaef 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 to match them to take into account 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.419
 we accept the messages 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.319
 height of the line 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.199
 and with that we have realized 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.319
 our budget of the pair
