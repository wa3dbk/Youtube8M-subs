shifting like the ground or whatever

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.719 
shifting like the ground or whatever
it's<00:01:05.610> annoying<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.150> hell<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's annoying as hell but you know you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
it's annoying as hell but you know you
have<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.390> pretty<00:01:09.600> easy<00:01:09.780> once

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
have to get over it's pretty easy once

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
have to get over it's pretty easy once
again<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.130> such<00:01:11.250> an<00:01:11.369> easy<00:01:11.610> game

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
again this is just such an easy game

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
again this is just such an easy game
except<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.380> makes<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.710> game

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
except that I think what makes this game

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.010 
except that I think what makes this game
hard<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> controls<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hard is the controls and all that and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
hard is the controls and all that and
all<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> problems<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> game<00:01:17.700> hard<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
all the problems make the game hard but

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.480 
all the problems make the game hard but
it's<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:19.439> bad<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.250> because

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's not because we're bad is because

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.140 
it's not because we're bad is because
the<00:01:20.610> games<00:01:20.880> bad<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.750> me

the<00:02:35.990> fact<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.470> matter<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.150> you

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
the fact of the matter is is that you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.060 
the fact of the matter is is that you
pretty<00:02:38.660> much<00:02:38.930> can't<00:02:39.290> press<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.830> triangle

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
pretty much can't press the triangle

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.100 
pretty much can't press the triangle
button<00:02:40.400> because<00:02:40.850> do<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> triangle<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:42.080> this

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
button because do the triangle like this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.230 
button because do the triangle like this
meant<00:02:42.560> made<00:02:42.740> your<00:02:42.950> attack<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.610> there's

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
meant made your attack because there's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240 
meant made your attack because there's
pretty<00:02:44.630> much<00:02:44.660> two<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:45.290> gaps<00:02:45.530> between<00:02:45.830> like

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
pretty much two little gaps between like

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.070 
pretty much two little gaps between like
water<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.790> land<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.210> pretty<00:02:47.390> much<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.660> travel

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
water and land so pretty much you travel

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.870 
water and land so pretty much you travel
for<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> meter<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.610> have<00:02:49.760> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
for like a meter and then you have to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.120 
for like a meter and then you have to
stop<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.080> that's<00:02:51.440> why<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.650> don't<00:02:51.800> like<00:02:51.920> using

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
stop so that's why I don't like using

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.800 
stop so that's why I don't like using
the<00:02:52.670> coffee<00:02:53.090> cups<00:02:53.390> or<00:02:53.480> whatever<00:02:54.670> okay<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.090> hate
