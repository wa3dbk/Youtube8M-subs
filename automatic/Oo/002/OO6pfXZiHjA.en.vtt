00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.180
 Thank you for the sound of the five chocolate from the choco. 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.180
 1 word 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.800
 This time, when you see the game slip that studio 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:23.759
 The broadcast title I tried to control the game wrote the original room COOPER 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.759
 I'll get an error and write it in Hangul in one room and enter the Flavor. 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.279
 The volume of the original voice is too small to say that the ability to raise the volume 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.279
 I added it. What would you do if I saw it? 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:48.380
 Well, even though the character has been to t 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:51.080
 The answer is not coming back, but it hurts like a habit. 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.790
 This room is no more than me 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:59.600
 However, since single life changes quite a bit, 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.960
 No, just one thing to worry about 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 There is something in this room. 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.280
 To 9 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.870
 It's not easy yet. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.470
 I was a little nervous from the beginning . 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.470
 Massage for reference 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:37.659
 I would have come out with a curtain before I left the house. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.659
 I feel like I feel like I'm just feeling 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.110
 Previously came in and out this feeling that something here 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.480
 I do not remember what I did. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.270

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.560
 Excellent 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 Although side journal bearing usually has two shelves filled with this and that 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.600
 Namsan and looks like something out away from Kiku jeonhap shade or twitching or somehow 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 I often feel that way. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.330
 Actually, there is no tree, but the heart is dead even if it sounds really trivial . 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 same 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:22.660
 Is there something that came Mana does not like 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.820
 Besides disproportionately yireondeseo very interested in literature it is not idly that grimace 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.500
 Think things 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.500
 I can not see what I'm seeing. 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.569

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.219

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.570
 Super biopsy 4

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.480
 Also that 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.840
 By the way 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.020
 Well what is coming 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.470
 My bed was rough and bumpy with me . 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.340
 It's not. 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.080
 That wen 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.530
 Something's in there. 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:33.110
 There are times when I can not quite get out of the delusion . 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:37.270
 For example, it used a dark place or in incredibly nervous edge in sight 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.270
 Dageona get the feeling this something moving 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.860
 If horror games such as stab or cut off or be jjotgi obviously things beyond just 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.890
 Not a chitchat 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:55.050
 But the fact is that I love your 10-year-old brother, 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.050
 Do not swear . One forgiveness will eat me. 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.330
 I saw why 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.270
 I feel like I have someone beyond the door. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.490

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.930
 Okay. Well Head South 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:04.490

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.460
 It's over. 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:13.060

 In the dark and nothing 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:56.419
 Come up with things that are useless even I want to think about how you 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.839
 For example, a horrible dream I once dreamed of 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.839
 Or 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.270
