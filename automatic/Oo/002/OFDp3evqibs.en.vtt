00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.689
 good lizbeth eros how are the day of 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.340
 today I bring a video of another filter 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.160
 home 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.090
 good materials 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.090
 a sponge 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.590
 and cotton can be wadding or pearl 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:24.130
 dora small stones hose pipe 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.530
 pvc and a container 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.520
 with cover 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.150
 well let's move on 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.670
 our container have to have a lid 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.190
 it has to be covered by the part of 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 down we have more holes here 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.399
 but it's total 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 in our cover we will have to do 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.329
 two large perforations and the rest 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 small one where to go to our tube 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.850
 pvc depending on its size and other flag 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.620
 our air hose worships 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.630
 to our pvc tube we will have to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.660
 make him a piercing 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.050
 in these parts that is not left is what 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.770
 go down that is not far below 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.670
 and I put a piece of unicel 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.230
 regulate the bubbling 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.410
 well the procedure is as follows 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.130
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.100
 our stones at the bottom of our 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 container 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.060
 well there they are 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 the second thing that we will have to do is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.409
 connect our pvc tube 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.789
 our hoses but 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.109
 we have to take into account that we have 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.440
 have to be any holes in the 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:45.140
 sponge to fit 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.140
 it can be something like that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.110
 Let it be this way 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.310
 can pass the hose 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.250
 also our everything 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.500
 then we will have to put our 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.500
 little hose in our tube that we made 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 we will have something like that 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.459
 then we will put our cotton wadding 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.180
 or sorry what they can get and what 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.770
 we will put here is going to stay stone 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.270
 cotton and sponge 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.310
 good is going to be more or less of this 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.670
 way now what follows is to enter 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.380
 here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.410
 our 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 everything we have done already and right now 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.470
 good teachers 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.250
 and so it would be the stones was with 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.730
 cotton and sponge 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 We proceed to put this stage by 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.970
 up for the masses good finally 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 it would be this way 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.220
 it's not complicated at all the truth is a 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 little more tedious and some materials 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.050
 what to get like the container 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.510
 and this one isr that regulates the bubbles 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.879
 I made some small holes and 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.790
 comes out 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:22.860
 this filter more than anything is like 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 fry is what you investigate this is 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.519
 you know how a box filter has the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.270
 same function as a box filter the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.580
 moment of being inside 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.270
 Well, you are going to enter water for these 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.010
 perforations and it will happen down 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.500
 when it's happening down then it's 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.650
 will fill and our here our tube 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.390
 like this bubbling inside 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 our hose will lift the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.100
 bubbles is going to form the vacuum that goes 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.350
 to absorb here our tube water return 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.510
 to start dating and the truth as 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.760
 works very well for me and now the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.390
 show in operation 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.380
 good as we see here is working 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.370
 there is a little bubbling and inside 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.370
 Well, it's leaking 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.040
 this would be all thank you very much for the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.859
 video any questions please leave the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.030
 comments that I will solve it good 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.030
 thank you very much and good luck
