so<00:00:02.370> here's<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.700> TI<00:00:02.909> launch<00:00:03.389> pad<00:00:03.750> with<00:00:04.560> the

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
so here's the TI launch pad with the

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.820 
so here's the TI launch pad with the
msp430<00:00:06.029> microcontroller<00:00:06.589> in<00:00:07.589> it

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
msp430 microcontroller in it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.490 
msp430 microcontroller in it
soon<00:00:08.370> after<00:00:08.700> playing<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.480> board<00:00:10.050> for

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
soon after playing with this board for

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.640 
soon after playing with this board for
the<00:00:10.590> first<00:00:10.620> time<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.309> wanted<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the first time I wanted to get off of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.170 
the first time I wanted to get off of
the<00:00:13.920> USB<00:00:14.429> power<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.000> instead<00:00:15.690> use<00:00:16.470> batteries

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
the USB power and instead use batteries

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.160 
the USB power and instead use batteries
this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> broken<00:00:19.100> piece<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> electronics<00:00:21.170> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
this is a broken piece of electronics it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.980 
this is a broken piece of electronics it
has<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> battery<00:00:22.800> pack<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.930> thought<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
has a battery pack in it I thought I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.820 
has a battery pack in it I thought I
would<00:00:26.060> use<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.570> battery<00:00:27.869> pack<00:00:28.170> with

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
would use just the battery pack with

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
would use just the battery pack with
some<00:00:28.980> alligator<00:00:29.369> cables<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.449> could

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
some alligator cables to see if I could

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
some alligator cables to see if I could
power<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.890> msp430<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.829> two

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
power up the msp430 so have two

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.350 
power up the msp430 so have two
batteries<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:36.380> which<00:00:37.489> gives<00:00:38.489> us<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.910> 3

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
batteries in here which gives us about 3

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
batteries in here which gives us about 3
volts<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> corner<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.250> board<00:00:44.430> we

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
volts so on the corner of the board we

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.830 
volts so on the corner of the board we
have<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.820> VCC<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.949> ground<00:00:53.840> we

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
have we have VCC and we have ground we

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.819 
have we have VCC and we have ground we
have<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.079> grounds

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.300 

as<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.580> can<00:01:04.759> see<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.239> launchpad<00:01:06.049> is<00:01:06.470> being

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
as you can see the launchpad is being

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.289 
as you can see the launchpad is being
powered<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:08.270> these<00:01:08.420> two<00:01:08.659> batteries<00:01:10.299> so

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
powered just with these two batteries so

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.859 
powered just with these two batteries so
now<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.720> know<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:12.110> can<00:01:12.350> work<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:13.780> want<00:01:14.780> to

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
now that I know this can work I want to

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.190 
now that I know this can work I want to
make<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.200> wiring<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.070> little<00:01:16.310> more<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.939> little

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
make this wiring a little more a little

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.779 
make this wiring a little more a little
safer<00:01:18.200> from<00:01:18.710> being<00:01:19.670> shorted<00:01:20.149> out<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.670> an

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
safer from being shorted out this is an

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.510 
safer from being shorted out this is an
old<00:01:25.939> TV<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.869> took<00:01:27.080> apart<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.680> save<00:01:28.100> for

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
old TV that I took apart and save for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.300 
old TV that I took apart and save for
scrap<00:01:28.939> parts<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.570> I'm<00:01:29.659> glad<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.869> did<00:01:30.170> because

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
scrap parts and I'm glad I did because

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.679 
scrap parts and I'm glad I did because
here<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.429> something<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:31.939> can<00:01:32.179> use<00:01:32.390> right

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
here is something that I can use right

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.450 
here is something that I can use right
now<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:35.030> connector<00:01:35.630> has<00:01:36.190> three<00:01:37.190> wires

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
now this connector has three wires

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.419 
now this connector has three wires
coming<00:01:38.149> out<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.649> that's<00:01:39.799> exactly<00:01:40.100> what

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
coming out of it and that's exactly what

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:52.090 
coming out of it and that's exactly what
I<00:01:40.460> need<00:01:40.929> so<00:01:41.929> see<00:01:42.140> if<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.319> can<00:01:42.500> take<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.709> off<00:01:51.100> so

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
I need so see if I can take that off so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.960 
I need so see if I can take that off so
this<00:01:52.250> connector<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.700> in<00:01:52.789> good<00:01:52.909> shape

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
this connector is in good shape

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.880 
this connector is in good shape
hopefully<00:01:53.959> I<00:01:54.020> can<00:01:54.080> connect<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
hopefully I can connect it to the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.070 
hopefully I can connect it to the
launchpad<00:01:57.490> there's<00:01:58.490> all<00:01:58.640> kinds<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.149> good

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
launchpad there's all kinds of good

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.699 
launchpad there's all kinds of good
parts<00:02:00.470> in<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> scrap<00:02:01.159> TV<00:02:02.500> hopefully<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.530> will

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
parts in the scrap TV hopefully I will

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.139 
parts in the scrap TV hopefully I will
get<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.950> use<00:02:04.130> more<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.429> these<00:02:04.610> parts<00:02:05.000> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
get to use more of these parts and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.249 
get to use more of these parts and
future<00:02:05.479> projects<00:02:06.970> okay<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.539> now<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.780> have<00:02:09.050> the

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
future projects okay so now we have the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.280 
future projects okay so now we have the
connector<00:02:09.739> from<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.550> broken<00:02:11.150> television<00:02:11.930> set

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
connector from the broken television set

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
connector from the broken television set
let's<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.379> can<00:02:15.500> get<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.769> permanently

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
let's see if we can get this permanently

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.570 
let's see if we can get this permanently
wired<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:16.970> battery<00:02:17.300> pack<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:19.250> right<00:02:19.370> so

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
wired to the battery pack all right so

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
wired to the battery pack all right so
I've<00:02:19.670> taken<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.000> batteries<00:02:20.660> out<00:02:20.870> because<00:02:21.470> I'm

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
I've taken the batteries out because I'm

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.680 
I've taken the batteries out because I'm
going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.250> do<00:02:22.459> some<00:02:22.670> soldering<00:02:22.879> now<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
going to do some soldering now this is a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.559 
going to do some soldering now this is a
toy<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.140> my<00:02:27.260> son<00:02:27.560> had<00:02:27.890> it's<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.910> voice<00:02:29.180> changer

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
toy that my son had it's a voice changer

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.610 
toy that my son had it's a voice changer
as<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:31.370> microphone<00:02:31.910> here<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.599> talk<00:02:32.930> into<00:02:33.379> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
as a microphone here you talk into and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.100 
as a microphone here you talk into and
it<00:02:33.739> changes<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:34.879> way<00:02:35.030> your<00:02:35.209> voice<00:02:35.629> sounds

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
it changes this way your voice sounds

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.350 
it changes this way your voice sounds
when<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.349> comes<00:02:36.500> out<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.800> speaker<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:38.120> it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
when it comes out of the speaker but it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.970 
when it comes out of the speaker but it
broke<00:02:38.659> and<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.080> doesn't<00:02:39.349> work<00:02:39.500> anymore

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
broke and it doesn't work anymore

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.180 
broke and it doesn't work anymore

clip<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> off<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.690> before<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.050> do<00:02:48.140> I'm<00:02:48.409> going<00:02:48.530> to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
clip it off but before I do I'm going to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:03:01.720 
clip it off but before I do I'm going to
take<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:48.800> peek<00:02:49.040> inside

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.690 

I<00:03:01.819> might<00:03:02.480> keep<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.440> switch<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.550> I'll<00:03:04.670> be

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I might keep this switch so that I'll be

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.940 
I might keep this switch so that I'll be
a<00:03:04.849> power<00:03:05.180> switch<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.519> microcontroller

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
a power switch for the microcontroller

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.420 
a power switch for the microcontroller
see<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:09.980> speaker<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.819> here<00:03:11.980> which<00:03:12.980> maybe<00:03:13.220> I'll

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
see a speaker in here which maybe I'll

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.070 
see a speaker in here which maybe I'll
plug<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:13.909> speaker<00:03:14.390> into<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.659> micro

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
plug the speaker into the micro

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.809 
plug the speaker into the micro
controller<00:03:15.470> for<00:03:15.769> something<00:03:16.159> too<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.760> I'll

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
controller for something too so I'll

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.940 
controller for something too so I'll
just<00:03:17.000> leave<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.360> in<00:03:17.540> there<00:03:17.769> there<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:18.799> a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
just leave that in there there is a

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.130 
just leave that in there there is a
little<00:03:20.379> chip<00:03:21.379> on<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.890> board

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140

HK<00:03:24.140> 386<00:03:25.129> Oh<00:03:25.340> 18<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:27.370> don't<00:03:28.370> know<00:03:28.459> what<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.970> I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
HK 386 Oh 18 I don't know what that is I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.309 
HK 386 Oh 18 I don't know what that is I
could<00:03:29.599> look<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.959> up

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
could look it up

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.770 
could look it up
I've<00:03:30.920> removed<00:03:31.099> most<00:03:31.549> of<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.849> components

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
I've removed most of the components

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.630 
I've removed most of the components
inside<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.260> box<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:34.370> what<00:03:34.489> I'm<00:03:34.610> really

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
inside this box but what I'm really

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.490 
inside this box but what I'm really
interested<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.569> battery<00:03:35.930> pack<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
interested in is the battery pack I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.460 
interested in is the battery pack I
soldered<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:38.079> connector<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:41.470> battery

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
soldered the connector to the battery

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:52.589 
soldered the connector to the battery
pack

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.140 

so<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> way<00:03:53.379> I've<00:03:53.499> soldered<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.340> connector

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so the way I've soldered just connector

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.039 
so the way I've soldered just connector
up<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:57.549> that<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.999> red<00:03:58.930> wire<00:03:59.230> is<00:04:00.040> PCC<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.049> the

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
up is that the red wire is PCC and the

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.729 
up is that the red wire is PCC and the
white<00:04:02.260> wire<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.769> ground<00:04:04.349> so<00:04:05.349> let's<00:04:05.499> see<00:04:05.650> if

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
white wire is ground so let's see if

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:17.849 
white wire is ground so let's see if
this<00:04:05.859> powers<00:04:06.370> up<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.730> board<00:04:06.969> and<00:04:09.689> it<00:04:10.689> does

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.980 

so<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> now<00:04:18.759> have<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:20.579> battery<00:04:21.579> pack<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:24.039> an

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
so I now have a battery pack and on an

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.159 
so I now have a battery pack and on an
easy<00:04:25.990> way<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:27.030> carry<00:04:28.030> this<00:04:29.009> launchpad<00:04:30.009> around

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
easy way to carry this launchpad around

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.179 
easy way to carry this launchpad around
without<00:04:32.169> having<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.650> plug<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.949> into<00:04:33.069> a

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.189 
without having to plug it into a

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.249 
without having to plug it into a
computer<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:34.449> without<00:04:34.689> having<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.990> plug<00:04:35.169> it

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
computer and without having to plug it

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:41.040 
computer and without having to plug it
into<00:04:35.379> USB<00:04:35.680> power<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:40.000> script<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.539> I<00:04:40.599> flashed

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
into USB power the script that I flashed

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.749 
into USB power the script that I flashed
to<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.469> microcontroller<00:04:44.039> makes<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.280> LED

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
to the microcontroller makes the LED

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.929 
to the microcontroller makes the LED
blink<00:04:46.150> faster<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.169> faster<00:04:47.520> each<00:04:48.520> time<00:04:48.789> it

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
blink faster and faster each time it

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.689 
blink faster and faster each time it
goes<00:04:49.060> through<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.509> loop<00:04:50.159> there's<00:04:51.159> less<00:04:51.430> time

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
goes through the loop there's less time

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.330 
goes through the loop there's less time
between<00:04:51.940> flashes<00:04:52.719> so<00:04:53.469> that<00:04:53.590> gets<00:04:53.740> faster<00:04:54.219> and

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
between flashes so that gets faster and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.110 
between flashes so that gets faster and
faster<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:56.190> think<00:04:57.190> it<00:04:57.490> makes<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.729> look<00:04:57.819> like<00:04:58.090> a

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
faster I think it makes it look like a

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.249 
faster I think it makes it look like a
bomb<00:04:58.509> is<00:04:58.750> about<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.990> blow<00:04:59.289> up

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
bomb is about to blow up

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.760 
bomb is about to blow up
to<00:05:02.259> summarize<00:05:02.740> yes<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.819> can<00:05:04.379> power<00:05:05.379> a

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
to summarize yes you can power a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.409 
to summarize yes you can power a
launchpad<00:05:06.280> using<00:05:07.740> batteries<00:05:09.029> in<00:05:10.029> this<00:05:10.150> case

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
launchpad using batteries in this case

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.730 
launchpad using batteries in this case
two<00:05:10.719> double-a<00:05:11.199> batteries<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.289> can<00:05:14.500> use

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
two double-a batteries and you can use

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.899 
two double-a batteries and you can use
salvaged<00:05:15.340> parts

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
salvaged parts

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.260 
salvaged parts
I<00:05:16.319> spent<00:05:17.319> nothing<00:05:17.740> I'll<00:05:18.400> probably<00:05:18.610> continue

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
I spent nothing I'll probably continue

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.580 
I spent nothing I'll probably continue
to<00:05:19.330> play<00:05:19.569> with<00:05:19.599> this<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:22.050> maybe<00:05:23.050> make<00:05:23.349> use<00:05:23.560> of

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
to play with this and maybe make use of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:32.579 
to play with this and maybe make use of
this<00:05:23.830> speaker<00:05:24.699> on<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:24.969> bottom

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:34.409 

well<00:05:33.129> this<00:05:33.249> little<00:05:33.519> guy's<00:05:33.669> been<00:05:33.699> running<00:05:34.239> all

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
well this little guy's been running all

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.979 
well this little guy's been running all
night<00:05:35.399> and<00:05:36.399> it's<00:05:36.639> still<00:05:36.879> running<00:05:37.059> no<00:05:37.509> problem

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:37.989 
night and it's still running no problem

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:42.359 
night and it's still running no problem
I<00:05:38.429> put<00:05:39.429> it<00:05:39.519> back<00:05:39.639> together<00:05:39.849> again<00:05:40.149> I<00:05:41.279> put<00:05:42.279> the

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
I put it back together again I put the

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.939 
I put it back together again I put the
keys<00:05:42.579> back<00:05:42.609> together<00:05:42.999> again<00:05:43.359> all<00:05:43.749> the<00:05:43.839> way<00:05:43.989> so

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
keys back together again all the way so

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:51.299 
keys back together again all the way so
now<00:05:45.129> we<00:05:45.189> have<00:05:45.639> a<00:05:48.899> battery<00:05:49.899> pack<00:05:50.079> for<00:05:50.379> the<00:05:50.619> Tiana

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.309 
now we have a battery pack for the Tiana

00:05:51.309 --> 00:06:03.559 
now we have a battery pack for the Tiana
Launchpad<00:05:51.929> made<00:05:52.929> out<00:05:53.079> of<00:05:53.169> recycled<00:05:53.319> parts

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.629 

I<00:06:03.659> think<00:06:04.259> it<00:06:04.349> would<00:06:04.529> be<00:06:04.619> cool<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:05.009> put<00:06:05.069> this<00:06:05.369> in

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
I think it would be cool to put this in

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.209 
I think it would be cool to put this in
my<00:06:05.699> truck<00:06:07.189> and<00:06:08.629> make<00:06:09.629> would-be<00:06:10.409> thieves<00:06:10.740> think

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
my truck and make would-be thieves think

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.040 
my truck and make would-be thieves think
that<00:06:11.429> it's<00:06:11.580> a<00:06:11.990> security<00:06:12.990> alarm<00:06:14.839> the<00:06:15.839> light

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
that it's a security alarm the light

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.079 
that it's a security alarm the light
blinks<00:06:16.289> faster<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:16.949> faster<00:06:17.129> as<00:06:17.429> time<00:06:17.669> goes<00:06:17.879> on

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
blinks faster and faster as time goes on
