of<00:01:47.189> faith<00:01:47.460> faith<00:01:47.670> don't<00:01:47.880> except<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> ace

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
of faith faith don't except for the ace

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
of faith faith don't except for the ace
so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> trick<00:01:50.549> no<00:01:50.790> other<00:01:51.030> card<00:01:51.299> is

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so that's the trick no other card is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.649 
so that's the trick no other card is
face<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.659> except<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> four<00:01:53.100> rays<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
face up except for the four rays and

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
face up except for the four rays and
that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.200> easy<00:01:55.350> trick<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:56.070> I'm

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that is a pretty easy trick to do I'm

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
that is a pretty easy trick to do I'm
going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> show<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> want

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
going to show it to actually do you want

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.219 
going to show it to actually do you want
to<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> secret<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.780> there<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> none

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to know what the secret is there is none

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170 
to know what the secret is there is none
there<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> no<00:02:01.799> secret<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.880> exactly

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
there is no secret if you do exactly

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.429 
there is no secret if you do exactly
like<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.540> did<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:04.860> work<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
like I did it will work for you

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.949 
like I did it will work for you
there<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.619> no<00:02:07.799> some<00:02:08.220> sort<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.090> hidden<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.690> what

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
there is no some sort of hidden see what

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.880 
there is no some sort of hidden see what
was<00:02:10.140> done

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.560 

apparently<00:02:14.890> someone<00:02:15.280> wants<00:02:15.640> me<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.880> pay<00:02:16.270> my

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
apparently someone wants me to pay my

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.430 
apparently someone wants me to pay my
debts<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.490> more<00:02:18.700> important<00:02:20.160> now

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
debts but but this is more important now

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.340 
debts but but this is more important now
here<00:02:23.440> on<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:25.030> take<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.300> four<00:02:25.630> aces<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
here on you take the four aces and you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.550 
here on you take the four aces and you
take<00:02:26.590> twelve<00:02:26.980> other<00:02:27.220> costs<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.780> four

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
take twelve other costs of this for four

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.870 
take twelve other costs of this for four
and<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.610> next<00:02:30.940> well<00:02:31.150> okay<00:02:32.490> now<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.550> ask

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and for that next well okay now you ask

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.030 
and for that next well okay now you ask
them<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.300> place<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.960> Asus<00:02:35.260> anywhere<00:02:35.500> they<00:02:35.980> can

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
them to place the Asus anywhere they can

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.620 
them to place the Asus anywhere they can
truly<00:02:36.340> take<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.850> place<00:02:37.030> them<00:02:37.209> anyway<00:02:37.540> it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
truly take and place them anyway it

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.460 
truly take and place them anyway it
doesn't<00:02:37.810> matter

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
doesn't matter

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.100 
doesn't matter
and<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:39.970> do<00:02:40.240> exactly<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:41.050> did

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and now you do exactly like I did

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
and now you do exactly like I did
earlier<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> take<00:02:41.920> every<00:02:42.220> other<00:02:42.250> card<00:02:42.640> and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
earlier you take every other card and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.470 
earlier you take every other card and
turn<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.120> over

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
turn it over

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.300 
turn it over
the<00:02:43.690> first<00:02:43.930> card<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.380> don't<00:02:44.650> turn<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.160> over

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the first card you don't turn it over

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.590 
the first card you don't turn it over
okay<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.320> way<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> do<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.420> way

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
okay so the way you do this is the way

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.630 
okay so the way you do this is the way
it's<00:02:49.959> easier<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.680> sort<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.010> mess<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.280> is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
it's easier to do sort of mess up is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.570 
it's easier to do sort of mess up is
count<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.239> cards<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.600> one<00:02:52.900> two<00:02:53.410> one<00:02:53.950> two<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
count the cards like one two one two and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.430 
count the cards like one two one two and
every<00:02:54.850> time<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.150> say<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.810> turn<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.230> card

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
every time you say to you turn the card

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.440 
every time you say to you turn the card
over<00:02:56.550> because<00:02:57.550> some<00:02:57.730> people<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.360> be<00:03:00.300> they<00:03:01.300> can

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
over because some people can be they can

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.300 
over because some people can be they can
screw<00:03:01.930> up<00:03:02.080> when<00:03:02.260> they<00:03:02.470> come<00:03:02.680> through<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> face

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
screw up when they come through a face

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.670 
screw up when they come through a face
of<00:03:03.550> ACE<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.150> kind<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.450> freeze<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:05.470> that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
of ACE and they kind of freeze like that

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.080 
of ACE and they kind of freeze like that
and<00:03:05.890> they<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:06.100> know<00:03:06.400> should<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.730> turn<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
and they don't know should I turn this

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.120 
and they don't know should I turn this
over<00:03:07.270> or<00:03:07.510> not<00:03:07.690> but<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:08.530> come<00:03:08.739> one<00:03:08.980> two

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
over or not but if you just come one two

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.430 
over or not but if you just come one two
one<00:03:09.340> two<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.610> always<00:03:09.970> turn<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.350> card<00:03:11.350> over

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
one two and always turn the card over

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560 
one two and always turn the card over
when<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.800> say<00:03:12.010> -<00:03:12.220> there<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.550> no<00:03:12.700> problem<00:03:13.180> okay

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
when you say - there is no problem okay

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.780 
when you say - there is no problem okay
now<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.320> this<00:03:14.980> time<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.310> don't<00:03:15.519> need<00:03:15.640> to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
now you this time you don't need to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.759 
now you this time you don't need to
memorize<00:03:15.910> anything<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.630> they<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:17.140> turn<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
memorize anything you they can turn the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.890 
memorize anything you they can turn the
cards<00:03:18.010> over<00:03:18.100> if<00:03:18.340> they<00:03:18.489> want<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.360> ask

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
cards over if they want so you just ask

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.330 
cards over if they want so you just ask
them<00:03:20.170> do<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.350> want<00:03:20.410> me<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.739> turn<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.100> over

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
them do you want me to turn this over

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.370 
them do you want me to turn this over
static<00:03:21.670> say<00:03:21.970> yes<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.330> don't<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.870> they<00:03:23.019> say<00:03:23.200> no

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
static say yes you don't if they say no

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.890 
static say yes you don't if they say no
you<00:03:23.440> don't<00:03:23.680> them<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.580> doesn't<00:03:24.820> matter<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
you don't them it doesn't matter it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.500 
you don't them it doesn't matter it
always<00:03:26.140> works<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.580> can<00:03:27.760> even<00:03:27.910> give<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.330> card

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
always works you can even give it a card

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.180 
always works you can even give it a card
to<00:03:28.690> them<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.080> they<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.769> same<00:03:29.950> thing

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to them and they can do the same thing

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.160 
to them and they can do the same thing
but<00:03:30.340> first<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.970> do<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.180> with<00:03:31.360> two<00:03:31.570> cards<00:03:31.959> like

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
but first you do it with two cards like

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.560 
but first you do it with two cards like
I<00:03:32.320> did<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.769> then<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.880> take<00:03:34.030> four

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
I did and then you go and take four

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
thing it might you must grow up if you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.480 
thing it might you must grow up if you
think<00:04:40.750> too<00:04:40.960> much<00:04:40.990> about<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.920> dealing<00:04:42.340> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
think too much about the dealing and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.390 
think too much about the dealing and
doing<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:45.700> might<00:04:45.940> make<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.180> mistake<00:04:46.330> but

it's easy so if you already haven't

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.820 
it's easy so if you already haven't
