 I remember the easy victory of Kazan and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 on football

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.810
 we were played by the wings of the councils 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:22.320
 last chance wanted dreamed 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.670
 because i remember that game our teams 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:32.040

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.590

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 medals in 2003 did not give the rest team 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.870

 stories of ruby ​​and took their places in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.840
 hearts of Kazan fans now me 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.290

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.940
 unyielding competent player 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.940

 you have scored goals and zenith and that is 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.780

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.870
 zenith one to one as a blueprint 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.190
 made out of lazy distance I know that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.190

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.969
 worrying and when wins constantly 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:40.159
 they are examined as if our goals as 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:42.020
 played as well plays it happens 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.949
 when some matches are very strong 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.080
 upset about a day it's all angry then 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.229
 that you understood again 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.110
 worried about this match for the team 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.629
 worried about the points that could be 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.330
 get but in the end they didn't work out 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.229
 my dad must be stronger too 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.529

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.979
 than me 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:08.709
 that's when you go out and when our team 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.019
 won this here is empty 

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:13.389
 some kind of inner joy from 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:19.149
 the fact that we won and went out all 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:21.699
 hoarse and contented while you can 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.249
 helped the team can not help I don't know 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.259
 Of course that actually there but was 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.259
 next to them and seeing it all live 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.940
 ruby is our team is a team 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.610
 our city and that was not with them 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.050
 which instead was not anyway was on 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.050
 the stadium will do 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.590
 after all
