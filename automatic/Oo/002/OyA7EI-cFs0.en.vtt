00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
more gift to it and at first I was a bit

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.399 
more gift to it and at first I was a bit
concerned<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.019> mean<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> was

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
concerned that that would mean it was

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
concerned that that would mean it was
more<00:01:04.589> fragile<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.430> isn't<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
more fragile but it really isn't and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.359 
more fragile but it really isn't and
I've<00:01:06.030> thrown<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> washing<00:01:06.900> machine

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I'm not sure if that's advised or not

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
I'm not sure if that's advised or not
but<00:01:10.680> I've<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:10.950> mine<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> washing<00:01:11.549> machine

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
