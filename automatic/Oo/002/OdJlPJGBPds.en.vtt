00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
because it is not 514 to 960 because the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.500 
because it is not 514 to 960 because the

the display they are not within the body

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.319 
the display they are not within the body
so<00:00:49.309> they<00:00:49.430> will<00:00:49.520> take<00:00:49.730> some<00:00:49.940> part<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
so they will take some part of the

you<00:00:57.079> will<00:00:57.230> notice<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.250> problem<00:00:58.579> because<00:00:58.820> of

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
you will notice the problem because of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.119 
you will notice the problem because of
these<00:00:59.410> capacitive<00:01:00.410> buttons<00:01:00.440> which<00:01:00.829> will<00:01:00.980> take

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
these capacitive buttons which will take

this device does not have a magnetic
field<00:01:16.490> sensor<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.119> still<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.170> will<00:01:18.710> be<00:01:18.860> able

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
field sensor so still you will be able

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.590 
field sensor so still you will be able
to<00:01:19.070> use<00:01:19.310> gps<00:01:19.729> navigation<00:01:20.090> on<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:20.420> device

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
to use gps navigation on this device

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.510 
to use gps navigation on this device
because<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:20.990> has<00:01:21.200> gps<00:01:21.740> navigation<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
because it has gps navigation and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.340 
because it has gps navigation and
GLONASS<00:01:22.909> both<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.330> them<00:01:23.479> are<00:01:23.600> there<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.260> you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
GLONASS both of them are there so you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.740 
GLONASS both of them are there so you
can<00:01:24.530> use<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.979> gps<00:01:25.790> navigation<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.510> device

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
can use a gps navigation on this device

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.420 
can use a gps navigation on this device
with<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.020> help<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.560> although<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.250> does

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
with the help of that although it does

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.490 
with the help of that although it does
not<00:01:28.610> have<00:01:28.820> magnetic<00:01:29.090> sensors<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.840> gps

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
not have magnetic sensors so gps

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.560 
not have magnetic sensors so gps
navigation<00:01:30.979> may<00:01:31.220> not<00:01:31.400> may<00:01:32.030> not<00:01:32.180> be<00:01:32.330> very

navigation may not may not be very

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.990 
navigation may not may not be very
precise<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.320> can<00:01:33.500> still<00:01:33.740> use<00:01:34.000> navigation

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
precise but you can still use navigation

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.420

day-to-day usage without any issues and
should<00:02:30.370> forget<00:02:30.730> about<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.180> scores<00:02:31.480> which<00:02:31.900> is

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
should forget about the scores which is

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.260 
should forget about the scores which is
there<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.410> into<00:02:33.370> Duke<00:02:33.520> again<00:02:33.849> i<00:02:33.940> would<00:02:34.000> say

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
there on into Duke again i would say

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.120 
there on into Duke again i would say
this<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.599> pretty<00:02:34.810> impressive<00:02:35.110> score<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:36.099> a

this is a pretty impressive score for a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.470 
this is a pretty impressive score for a
device<00:02:36.370> which<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:36.700> only<00:02:36.940> seven<00:02:37.180> thousand

volume is now full and i can just play

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.010 
volume is now full and i can just play
the<00:03:12.069> video<00:03:12.310> again

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
this the overall volume of Tom will get

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.670 
this the overall volume of Tom will get
into<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.600> connector<00:03:26.960> get<00:03:27.140> into<00:03:27.440> fights

not gets off and again it just device
only<00:03:50.810> has<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.350> loudspeaker<00:03:51.830> over<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.250> there

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
only has one loudspeaker over here there

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.940 
only has one loudspeaker over here there
is<00:03:52.880> no<00:03:53.150> one<00:03:53.360> over<00:03:53.450> here<00:03:53.750> so<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.500> sound<00:03:54.680> does

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
is no one over here so the sound does

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.000 
is no one over here so the sound does
not<00:03:55.130> sketch<00:03:55.340> rock<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.790> again<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:57.470> sound<00:03:57.710> does

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
not sketch rock and again the sound does

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
covered this but again it will not get

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.580 
covered this but again it will not get
blocked<00:04:01.610> because<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.180> so<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:03.470> how

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590
