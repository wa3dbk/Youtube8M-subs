so<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.420> run

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
so it's not just like you can just run

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
so it's not just like you can just run
in<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.049> fly<00:01:46.860> around<00:01:47.159> forever<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
in there and fly around forever and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.490 
in there and fly around forever and
destroy<00:01:47.880> things<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> actually<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.259> plan

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
destroy things you actually have to plan

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.870 
destroy things you actually have to plan
accordingly<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.460> something<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
accordingly and that's something that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
accordingly and that's something that
really<00:01:51.060> stuck<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> play<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
really stuck out to me when I play this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
really stuck out to me when I play this
as<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.850> younger<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> game<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
as I was younger it was a game where I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.450 
as I was younger it was a game where I
actually<00:01:55.770> had<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.640> head<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:58.460> being

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually had to use my head and being

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
actually had to use my head and being
such<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> huge<00:02:00.210> fan<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> arcade<00:02:00.990> type<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.439> games

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
such a huge fan of arcade type of games

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
such a huge fan of arcade type of games
this<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> nice<00:02:02.280> change<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.149> what

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
this was a nice change for me and what

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.910 
this was a nice change for me and what
really<00:02:03.719> stands<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> me<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.439> game<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
really stands out to me in this game is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
really stands out to me in this game is
the<00:02:05.219> camera<00:02:05.640> angle<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.630> lead<00:02:06.810> designer

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the camera angle and the lead designer

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.260 
the camera angle and the lead designer
of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.590> game<00:02:07.829> Mike<00:02:08.190> Posen<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.940> believe<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
of the game Mike Posen I believe is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
of the game Mike Posen I believe is
pronounced<00:02:09.690> had<00:02:10.259> no<00:02:10.410> video<00:02:10.649> game<00:02:10.770> experience

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pronounced had no video game experience

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.460

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
prior to developing desert strike

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.500 
prior to developing desert strike
he<00:02:14.280> went<00:02:14.400> into<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:14.790> wanted<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> create

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
he went into it just wanted to create

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.480 
he went into it just wanted to create
kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> nonlinear<00:02:16.620> game<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.160> smooth

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
kind of a nonlinear game with smooth

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.660 
kind of a nonlinear game with smooth
animations<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.470> make<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> game<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.800> was

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
animations and make a game that was

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.520 
animations and make a game that was
similar<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.360> choplifter<00:02:21.690> he<00:02:22.410> was

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
similar to kind of choplifter he was

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.440 
similar to kind of choplifter he was
inspired<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.940> he<00:02:24.060> wanted<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> come

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
inspired by that but he wanted to come

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.880 
inspired by that but he wanted to come
up<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.780> camera<00:02:25.140> angle<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.620> used

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
up with this camera angle that used

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.960 
up with this camera angle that used
momentum<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.120> he<00:02:27.600> also<00:02:27.810> had<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.110> create<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.530> new

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
momentum so he also had to create a new

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.490 
momentum so he also had to create a new
physics<00:02:29.970> engine<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.720> represent<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
physics engine to represent that in the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.320 
physics engine to represent that in the
game<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.280> think<00:02:32.370> he<00:02:32.520> did<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> fantastic<00:02:32.880> job

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
game and I think he did a fantastic job

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.360 
game and I think he did a fantastic job
with<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.860> honest<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.220> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
