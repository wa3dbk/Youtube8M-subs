gonna<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.730> long<00:03:05.730> match<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.790> yeah<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
gonna be a long match so yeah it's a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.460 
gonna be a long match so yeah it's a
still<00:03:10.980> no<00:03:11.190> bomb<00:03:11.430> hits<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.150> gonna<00:03:12.299> all<00:03:13.230> go

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
still no bomb hits but it's gonna all go

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.400 
still no bomb hits but it's gonna all go
very<00:03:13.739> quickly<00:03:13.980> once<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.880> start<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> think

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
very quickly once we start and I think

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.720 
very quickly once we start and I think
it's<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.890> saw<00:03:17.100> right<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.459> with<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's going to I saw right now with a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.490 
it's going to I saw right now with a
nice<00:03:18.000> world<00:03:18.329> by<00:03:18.450> me<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.870> single<00:03:19.170> next<00:03:19.350> one

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
nice world by me and a single next one

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.580 
nice world by me and a single next one
big<00:03:19.920> blocks<00:03:20.250> every<00:03:21.120> defender<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.049> main

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
big blocks every defender and the main

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.789 
big blocks every defender and the main
get<00:03:22.829> out<00:03:23.540> well<00:03:24.540> quite<00:03:24.900> easy<00:03:25.260> hit<00:03:25.590> actually

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
get out well quite easy hit actually

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.580 
get out well quite easy hit actually
because<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:27.060> think<00:03:27.720> our<00:03:27.840> timing<00:03:28.170> was<00:03:28.200> really

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
because I think our timing was really

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.229 
because I think our timing was really
good<00:03:28.799> before<00:03:29.450> they<00:03:30.450> respond<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
good before they respond and and the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.539 
good before they respond and and the
rest<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.690> defenders<00:03:34.079> were<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.560> world<00:03:34.769> like

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
rest of the defenders were a world like

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.720 
rest of the defenders were a world like
perfectly<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:37.859> couldn't<00:03:38.070> actually<00:03:38.340> do

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
perfectly so they couldn't actually do

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.970 
perfectly so they couldn't actually do
do<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> lot<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.079> world<00:03:40.230> about<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.680> rabbit

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
do a lot of the world about my rabbit

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.759 
do a lot of the world about my rabbit
and<00:03:42.440> well<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.650> hit<00:03:43.829> was<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> was<00:03:45.000> well<00:03:45.769> good

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
and well that hit was a was well good

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.979 
and well that hit was a was well good
team<00:03:46.950> or<00:03:47.130> hang<00:03:47.340> yeah<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:48.600> really<00:03:48.750> couldn't

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
team or hang yeah they really couldn't

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.720 
team or hang yeah they really couldn't
do<00:03:49.140> nothing<00:03:49.500> about<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.069> at<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.519> point

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
do nothing about it and at this point

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.050 
do nothing about it and at this point
and<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:51.630> comes<00:03:51.950> second<00:03:52.950> attack<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.819> it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and here comes second attack and it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180 
and here comes second attack and it
drops<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.660> very<00:03:55.350> nice<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.799> there<00:03:55.979> because

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
drops it and very nice in there because

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.670 
drops it and very nice in there because
he<00:03:56.459> was<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:56.760> 14<00:03:57.479> and<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:59.160> was

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
he was like 14 and it was

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.339 
he was like 14 and it was
but<00:03:59.980> end<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> ball<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> shooter<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.359> but

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
but end the ball is a shooter and but

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.179 
but end the ball is a shooter and but
yeah<00:04:02.859> they<00:04:03.069> didn't<00:04:03.459> manage<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.700> pocket<00:04:04.150> I

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
yeah they didn't manage to pocket I

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.410 
yeah they didn't manage to pocket I
think<00:04:06.189> they<00:04:06.280> were<00:04:06.370> quite<00:04:06.609> unlike<00:04:06.969> on<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.239> one

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
think they were quite unlike on this one

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.360 
think they were quite unlike on this one
because<00:04:07.540> really<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:09.760> were<00:04:09.819> like<00:04:10.090> four<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.750> a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
because really they were like four on a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.780 
because really they were like four on a
added<00:04:12.370> place<00:04:12.609> and<00:04:12.819> uh<00:04:13.379> yeah<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:15.159> throw<00:04:15.760> was

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
added place and uh yeah the throw was

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.479 
added place and uh yeah the throw was
really<00:04:16.209> good<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:16.949> they<00:04:17.949> could<00:04:18.100> have<00:04:18.130> plotted

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
really good but they could have plotted

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.270 
really good but they could have plotted
like<00:04:18.850> equities<00:04:19.269> laughing<00:04:23.639> fanuc<00:04:24.639> forward

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
like equities laughing fanuc forward

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.160 
like equities laughing fanuc forward
control<00:04:25.639> there<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.030> middle<00:04:26.240> looks<00:04:27.020> like

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
control there in the middle looks like

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.379 
control there in the middle looks like
we<00:04:27.590> did<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> better<00:04:28.250> job<00:04:28.370> than<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:28.970> will<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.270> on

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
we did a better job than that will be on

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:38.679 
we did a better job than that will be on
this<00:04:29.540> math<00:04:32.290> literature<00:04:33.290> right<00:04:33.620> actually<00:04:36.790> well

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
this math literature right actually well

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.439 
this math literature right actually well
I<00:04:38.719> know<00:04:38.809> because<00:04:39.110> kuja<00:04:39.649> is<00:04:39.799> bad<00:04:40.009> at<00:04:40.549> exploded

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
I know because kuja is bad at exploded

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.019 
I know because kuja is bad at exploded
and<00:04:41.599> neighbor<00:04:41.869> is<00:04:42.139> better<00:04:42.379> and<00:04:43.029> bored

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
and neighbor is better and bored

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.559 
and neighbor is better and bored
asteroid<00:04:44.419> base<00:04:44.629> see<00:04:45.499> this<00:04:45.649> was<00:04:45.830> really<00:04:46.009> a

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
asteroid base see this was really a

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.329 
asteroid base see this was really a
quick<00:04:47.569> match<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.949> next<00:04:49.369> one<00:04:51.039> we'll<00:04:52.039> see<00:04:52.219> in<00:04:52.279> a

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:52.339 
quick match the next one we'll see in a

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:55.029 
quick match the next one we'll see in a
few<00:04:52.369> seconds<00:04:52.849> will<00:04:53.269> be<00:04:53.419> a<00:04:53.659> lot<00:04:54.139> longer<00:04:54.319> so<00:04:54.529> see

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
few seconds will be a lot longer so see

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.659 
few seconds will be a lot longer so see
with<00:04:55.189> then<00:04:55.369> go<00:04:56.119> beyond<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.479> woods
