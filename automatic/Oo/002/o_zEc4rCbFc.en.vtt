00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.029
 hello how am i lis cruise welcome 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.029
 to the research center rolls things 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.000
 Hello such video on wheels 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.490
 I'm going to show you an object that is going 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 camouflage I walk like star 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.020
 I'm going to talk about how the matter was 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.560
 they realize here there are three stars 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 very curious 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 is the one above and the one that is moving 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.550
 in a very very slow way 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.200
 and here 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 it seems as if it does 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 disappearing or as if it is 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.720
 fade well you the way so 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.460
 slow that is moving but very very 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 slow very slow and here it is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.100
 fading away I have to make a greater 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 zoom to be able 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 bring it closer and not lose me but 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 this object is fading 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 from the beginning as I saw in the 3 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.500
 stars the three lights for example 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.890
 that formed a triangle was condition 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.470
 wow what is that then the logo 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.380
 Place the camera at this site 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 where were the two stars and the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 object that was shown upwards but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.320
 it looked like a triangle then I said 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.510
 any of those is not because again 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.640
 I have seen the sky and I usually see 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.290
 two in that area then when I see the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
 third I said no no no this is not normal 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.869
 so I put the focus on that point and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.970
 and I realize that one or 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.770
 which was supposed to be 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.619
 camouflage I walk as a star starts 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.200
 to move very slowly very slowly and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.420
 is the recording that you are watching 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.060
 right now it's an object that is moving 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.039
 in a very slow way but already as 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.830
 we are approaching a lot if they are given 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.269
 account is hardly noticeable apenitas 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:23.489
 but the object is captured on the 14th of 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.930
 April 2013 at 9 35 here the time 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.940
 it's wrong because here we are with the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.390
 previous schedule then here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.540
 normally they should be 9 935 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.890
 well I'm son I used to wheel and even the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 next see you
