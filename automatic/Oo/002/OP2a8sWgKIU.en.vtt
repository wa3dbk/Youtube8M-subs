00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
today we're going to talk about how to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.419 
today we're going to talk about how to
trim<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.540> end<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.019> golf<00:00:13.230> shaft<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:14.070> make<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.140 
trim the end of a golf shaft to make it
firmer<00:00:14.759> well<00:00:15.420> that's<00:00:15.599> exactly<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> does

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
firmer well that's exactly what it does

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.820 
firmer well that's exactly what it does
when<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> got<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> shaft<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.140> has<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
when you got a shaft it has when it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
when you got a shaft it has when it
comes<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> factory<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.359> X

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
comes out of the factory it has an X

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.189 
comes out of the factory it has an X
amount<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.289> flex<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.850> shaft<00:00:24.119> trimming<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
amount of flex in the shaft trimming it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.620 
amount of flex in the shaft trimming it
off<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> budding<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> handle<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.390> where

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
off the budding or the handle in where

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
off the budding or the handle in where
the<00:00:27.750> grip<00:00:27.960> goes<00:00:28.230> would<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.189> affect<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the grip goes would not affect the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
the grip goes would not affect the
flexing<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> shaft<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.340> tipping<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> off

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
flexing of the shaft but tipping it off

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
flexing of the shaft but tipping it off
the<00:00:33.329> bottom<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.620> part<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.190> goes<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.700> the

the bottom in what part that goes in the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.930 
the bottom in what part that goes in the
head<00:00:36.030> does<00:00:36.930> stiffen<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.760> are

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
head does stiffen it there's a there are

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
head does stiffen it there's a there are
actually<00:00:39.450> charts<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.710> online

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
actually charts that you can go online

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.360 
actually charts that you can go online
and<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.790> about<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.079> amount<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.649> how<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and get about the amount of how much you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.119 
and get about the amount of how much you
cut<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.020> stiffen<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.980> we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
cut is how much you stiffen but we

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
cut is how much you stiffen but we
usually<00:00:47.340> talk<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.090> quarter<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.719> an<00:00:48.840> inch<00:00:49.020> --is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
usually talk in quarter of an inch --is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
usually talk in quarter of an inch --is
so<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> quarter<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so if we is going to take a quarter of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.139 
so if we is going to take a quarter of
an<00:00:51.539> inch<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.559> would<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:52.829> say<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> senior

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
an inch off it would make say a senior

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.619 
an inch off it would make say a senior
shaft<00:00:54.500> close<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> regular<00:00:56.460> shaft<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.480> we

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
shaft close to a regular shaft and if we

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
shaft close to a regular shaft and if we
took<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> half<00:00:58.199> inch<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.579> bring<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
took a half inch off it would bring it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420 
took a half inch off it would bring it
up<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> high<00:01:00.719> end<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> regular<00:01:01.800> shaft<00:01:02.129> an

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
up to the high end of a regular shaft an

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.719 
up to the high end of a regular shaft an
inch<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.690> 3/4<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.920> inch<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.280> probably

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
inch or 3/4 of an inch would probably

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
inch or 3/4 of an inch would probably
move<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> shaft<00:01:06.390> clear<00:01:06.810> into<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> stiff<00:01:07.890> shaft

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
move the shaft clear into a stiff shaft

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
move the shaft clear into a stiff shaft
range<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
range so if when you're going to put a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
range so if when you're going to put a
set<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> clubs<00:01:11.610> together<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.900> shafts

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
set of clubs together and the shafts

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
set of clubs together and the shafts
haven't<00:01:13.740> already<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.400> pre<00:01:14.820> tipped<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
haven't already been pre tipped for you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
haven't already been pre tipped for you
from<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> factory<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.700> tip

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
from the factory then you have to tip

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320 
from the factory then you have to tip
them<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:20.330> relationship

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
them and you do that by a relationship

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.170 
them and you do that by a relationship
of<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> head<00:01:22.439> weighs<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.180> what

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of how much the head weighs and what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
of how much the head weighs and what
stiffness<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.080> need<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.680> how<00:01:26.189> long<00:01:26.490> the

just start the salt and chop it the next
and<00:02:44.220> final<00:02:44.250> step<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.630> burr<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.380> take

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and final step is to just a burr to take

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
off there so that the grip goes on

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.190 
off there so that the grip goes on
smoothly<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.299> don't<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.599> cut<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.140> I'm
