00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that fight didn't last more than about

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
that fight didn't last more than about
around<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.230> felt<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.070> every

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
around and I felt like I got every

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.420 
around and I felt like I got every
Penny's<00:00:42.059> worth<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.719> 50<00:00:43.200> bucks<00:00:43.230> exciting<00:00:44.070> so

Penny's worth of my 50 bucks exciting so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.840 
Penny's worth of my 50 bucks exciting so
I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.820> Mayweather<00:00:45.590> might<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.800> able<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.219> run

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I think Mayweather might be able to run

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
I think Mayweather might be able to run
and<00:00:48.059> duck<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.570> eight<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.750> ten<00:00:49.050> rounds<00:00:49.500> he

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and duck for eight or ten rounds he

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
and duck for eight or ten rounds he
might<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.160> able<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> play<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.789> prevent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
might be able to play some prevent

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.900 
might be able to play some prevent
defense<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> while<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
defense for a while but at some point I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.290 
defense for a while but at some point I
think<00:00:54.090> Mayweather<00:00:55.070> will<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.340> punished<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
think Mayweather will get punished and I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.319 
think Mayweather will get punished and I
think<00:00:57.570> he<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.850> he<00:01:00.000> has<00:01:00.120> got

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
think he will go down I think he has got

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
think he will go down I think he has got
no<00:01:00.809> shot<00:01:01.109> against<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.710> guy<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.399> now

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
no shot against this guy right now

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
no shot against this guy right now
coming<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:03.510> retirement<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
coming off the long retirement that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
coming off the long retirement that
might<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.040> strong<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> say<00:01:05.850> no<00:01:06.210> shot

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
might be a little strong to say no shot

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
might be a little strong to say no shot
considering<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> Mayweather's<00:01:08.010> never<00:01:08.280> lost

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
considering that Mayweather's never lost
