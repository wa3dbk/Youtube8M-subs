even though it's plastic the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.310 
even though it's plastic the
construction<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.120> thing<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.510> rock-solid

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
construction on this thing is rock-solid

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.010 
construction on this thing is rock-solid
I've<00:01:03.379> used<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:04.040> riding<00:01:04.610> in<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.940> car<00:01:05.180> I've<00:01:05.510> used

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
failed me and I've used it in a lot of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.220 
failed me and I've used it in a lot of
really<00:01:10.040> tough<00:01:10.250> situations<00:01:11.000> where<00:01:11.240> buoyancy

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
really tough situations where buoyancy

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.410 
really tough situations where buoyancy
from<00:01:12.320> water<00:01:12.620> is<00:01:12.710> pushing<00:01:13.040> back<00:01:13.190> on<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.580> or<00:01:13.820> air

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
first configuration as it is now this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.890 
first configuration as it is now this
thing<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:27.979> awesome<00:01:28.370> fully<00:01:28.850> extended<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.540> what

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can kind of use the metal detector

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.820 
you can kind of use the metal detector
mode<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.880> get<00:01:35.180> some<00:01:35.420> low-lying<00:01:35.780> shots<00:01:36.230> you

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
mode and get some low-lying shots you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.250 
mode and get some low-lying shots you
can<00:01:37.010> kind<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.430> get<00:01:37.670> panning<00:01:38.300> shots<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.810> way

can kind of get panning shots that way
a<00:01:39.290> couple<00:01:39.830> different<00:01:40.160> angles<00:01:40.280> with<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
a couple different angles with it and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.120 
a couple different angles with it and
you<00:01:41.450> can<00:01:41.630> get<00:01:41.840> nice<00:01:42.080> smooth<00:01:42.500> shots<00:01:42.890> and

with<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.910> tripod<00:02:48.390> because<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
with this tripod because it if you get a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.980 
with this tripod because it if you get a
lot<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.520> wind<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.120> may<00:02:51.270> not<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.540> able<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> use

it but if you carry around I have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.510 
it but if you carry around I have
thought<00:02:54.960> about<00:02:54.990> using<00:02:55.680> maybe<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> ice<00:02:56.190> packs

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520

that will work very well with these
little<00:03:00.120> legs<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.470> thing<00:03:01.770> will<00:03:01.980> stand<00:03:02.280> up

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
little legs but this thing will stand up
