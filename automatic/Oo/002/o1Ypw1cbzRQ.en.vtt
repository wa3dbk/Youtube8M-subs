playing your character I did have fun
but<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.920> think<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> reason<00:02:30.540> why

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
but I think that the that the reason why

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
but I think that the that the reason why
that<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.680> fact<00:02:34.920> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that is is because I think the fact that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
that is is because I think the fact that
he<00:02:35.400> pulls<00:02:36.390> out<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.750> video<00:02:37.140> camera<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:37.920> on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
he pulls out the video camera on on

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.920 
he pulls out the video camera on on
Blake<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.270> fact<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> dream

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
Blake the fact that in the dream

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.020 
Blake the fact that in the dream
sequence<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.100> are<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.370> talking

sequence you know what are you talking
about<00:02:45.360> what<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> script

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
about what I think that's in the script

00:02:48.209 --> 00:03:13.729 
about what I think that's in the script
it<00:02:48.390> wasn't<00:02:48.720> mean<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.580> know<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:13.320> most<00:03:13.530> scary
