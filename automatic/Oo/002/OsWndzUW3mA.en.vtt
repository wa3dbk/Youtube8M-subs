00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 everyone loves 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.280
 I'm finally back with one 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.460
 new video and a make-up look 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 Today I wear in the last 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 time weird like fake eyelashes 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.470
 because I think that's the eyes 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 just look really nice 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 really dry there is so as 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 The eyes would immediately fall in the eye 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.329
 look really nice and sexy 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.969
 and that's why I thought so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 make that a video like the wrong one 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.989
 can wear eyelashes without saying so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 To look impersonated so one 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 carry a reasonably natural look 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.809
 Can be worn during the day 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 and there you have your false eyelashes 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 it is a very natural one 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 eyes make up that has the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 False eyelashes have to be added 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.680
 I say he is especially important what 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.010
 for false eyelashes you used 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.480
 I have such chris swanky so 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.980
 those that cross and hour 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.629
 These are always very natural 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.920
 you can do that for example on ebay 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 order that is much cheaper 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 worth mind to dm run and you there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 Individual buys because so often 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 one after the other one can not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.479
 bear the cost when dm I think they 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 maybe 23 euros and you're gonna get 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.400
 on ebay for a whole pack of 20 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 Eight or something for which I believe eight 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 euro or something so worth it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.070
 times on ebay or amazon so what 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.439
 purely to see if there is anything 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.909
 I would really recommend you so much 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.909
 fun, terry said next 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.360
 i start with a base i am ourselves 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.560
 a myspace just about the white 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.180
 color I'll come on it later 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.070
 a little better to pick up 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.070
 but you know every band you take 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.290
 home, it's from my to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 Face palette another color too 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.130
 here freedom should be left 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 just looks so similar takes that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.950
 what you have at home i wear the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.560
 color on the whole goes up and also 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.580
 under the brown bow just around there 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.780
 to marry, so to speak 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.000
 immediately with experienced ones next 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.160
 I mean the page cosmetic palette 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.310
 natural palette which is super great 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.190
 and take a bishop there 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.250
 have the relatively close my skin tone is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.990
 and just define my mine 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.290
 eye bit and target it this way 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.970
 sentiment continues through one of course 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.340
 then they think the same again 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.560
 getting easier are not that hard 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.600
 next is not such a color 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.260
 a slightly darker tone 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.260
 darker build and take and define 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.850
 so the outer v is a bit simple 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.800
 so that the eyes as I said a bit 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.200
 look defined and that will too 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.450
 again blinded next was valid 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 For a long time I participated with a black kohl 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.680
 small means sometimes the upper one 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.690
 waterline to allow the eye to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.000
 again is defined in more detail and the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.300
 eyelashes look fuller though 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.310
 you do not draw a line, I take that 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.800
 easy and also invite a little between 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.140
 eyelashes with a kohl and then pull 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.110
 also very very thin 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.050
 He strokes over the eyelashes too 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.459
 possible to be totally casual so must 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.010
 not perfect as it was then 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.180
 chosen because the bandages again 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.180
 blur it a bit 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.770
 we have to mix for the blinded 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.319
 a slightly wider brush next to it 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.050
 one with really hard bristles best 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.280
 so too short or what you too 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.349
 she just has to look home 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.410
 which offers itself quite well if not 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.630
 take the finger that we just 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 as I said my god I repeat myself 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.610
 Today for the 500 I always find only the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.530
 same words today and associate it 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 a bit, then we take too 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.670
 again a black color in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.650
 black shadow namely such a to 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.750
 such a market most evenly also 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.790
 on this hard brush on it and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.660
 blur it again and, so to speak 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.489
 such a very light, very thin black 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.569
 line to pull the eyelashes fuller 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.130
 to look like 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.420
 Now it's a bit quick 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.739
 then have the white again 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.900
 tightened 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.390
 so it's not quite as disappeared 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.209
 and now it is especially important that you 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.100
 It is best not to make your make before her 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.630
 applied up in detail small 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.400
 It happens quite often that they still 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.570
 the lower one, which is still black 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.260
 and we have to go back 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.320
 brush away 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.840
 viens has just seen with a 2 as 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.100
 Next is simply the eyelashes to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.260
 use 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.919
 blue1 a few with them examined 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.500
 look and then I use one 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.660
 channel in such a skin or you can 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.450
 pink or skin or something you 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.520
 At home I just like to say 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.919
 that black and below that me 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.720
 do not have to react to the work 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.550
 of course, the eyelashes will come next 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.890
 the most important part is snowing 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.020
 First off what's too long for me and 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.150
 she then stayed around the finger like that 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.140
 it looks to this arc, so to speak 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.300
 reinzubekommen 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.260
 it's actually harder, really 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.560
 adjust 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.860
 that has a glue and lives your pennants 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.870
 and because you have to just try around 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.300
 Exercise is what eyelashes really do 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.650
 The master you just have to try 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.289
 try try sometime it works 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.240
 just as it suits you then I go 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.450
 I am catholic and ink up and down 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.820
 nice and what i make my earth 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.449
 as long as the middle of the nice wet 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.389
 is 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.830
 to get back to my beliefs 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.300
 the eyelashes a bit better 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.340
 to combine with it 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.009
 not conspicuous and last 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.139
 of course, the make-up comes the cattle is 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.039
 like iris like you like it everybody 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:49.589
 day makes that is that such 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.589
 result you
