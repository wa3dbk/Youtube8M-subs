just want to give you guys a little
explanation<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.460> and<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.580> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
explanation of what it is and this is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.939 
explanation of what it is and this is
the<00:00:14.880> sound<00:00:15.120> box<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.560> antenna

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the sound box here it's got an antenna

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.120 
the sound box here it's got an antenna
on<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.260> doing<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> its

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
on it and what it's doing is its

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.840 
on it and what it's doing is its
broadcasting<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.270> i'm<00:00:21.449> using<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.050> pager

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
broadcasting when i'm using this pager

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.290 
broadcasting when i'm using this pager
and<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> hear<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> pager<00:00:26.300> that's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and so when you hear the pager that's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.590 
and so when you hear the pager that's
what<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.539> sounds<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.760> reality

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.389 

there's<00:00:33.600> no<00:00:33.899> sound<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.530> means<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.950> slight

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
there's no sound I means very slight

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.860 
there's no sound I means very slight
sound<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> caller

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
sound and you can see the caller

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.310 
sound and you can see the caller
vibrates<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.140> doing

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
vibrates so that's what we're doing

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
vibrates so that's what we're doing
using<00:00:43.710> predominantly<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> communicate<00:00:45.180> with

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
using predominantly to communicate with

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
using predominantly to communicate with
the<00:00:45.600> dog<00:00:46.520> when<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> hear<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> dick<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the dog when you hear the dick and the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.560 
the dog when you hear the dick and the
nick<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> adjustable<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:53.570> you're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
nick is adjustable on here you're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
nick is adjustable on here you're
hearing<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> nanosecond<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.280> hit<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
hearing that as a nanosecond you hit it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.069 
hearing that as a nanosecond you hit it
one<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:00.750> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
one time and it's basically just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
one time and it's basically just
contracting<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> dogs<00:01:02.280> muscle<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
contracting the dogs muscle it's not a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
contracting the dogs muscle it's not a
shock<00:01:03.600> we've<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.439> e-book<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.979> gives<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
shock we've got an e-book that gives a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
shock we've got an e-book that gives a
detailed<00:01:05.700> explanation<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> decades

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
detailed explanation of what the decades

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
detailed explanation of what the decades
if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> guys<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.100> interested<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.830> but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it's not a shock shock is something

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
it's not a shock shock is something
unexpected<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:13.920> can't<00:01:14.189> control<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
unexpected they can't control and this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.830 
unexpected they can't control and this
isn't<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.490> reality<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.600> these

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
buzzing sound that's when we're hitting

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.300 
buzzing sound that's when we're hitting
the<00:01:28.740> page<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> shorter<00:01:31.710> chirping<00:01:32.100> sound

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the page and the shorter chirping sound

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
understand we did not normally use these

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.730 
understand we did not normally use these
we<00:01:39.270> only<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> video<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
we only use them for the video so the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
we only use them for the video so the
