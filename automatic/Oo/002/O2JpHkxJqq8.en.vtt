00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.639
 oh my god and with it cordially 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.080
 Welcome to the new gameplay comments 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 do not keep in office 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.850
 yes i would love to the channel of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 Carey invited a guest commentary 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.890
 Of course I do not say that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.050
 No, because this opportunity this chance 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 gives me the possibility my videos 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.690
 main channel as well as my personality 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.360
 by a large audience, the ca 7000 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 active user if I course times 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.969
 includes to my youtube data as well 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.530
 Personal things I am a lot of 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 problems of many problems my name 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.960
 to pronounce what I unfortunately 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.890
 do not understand so I just think 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.789
 but that is also uninteresting yes 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 you have determined this bliem 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.180
 but surely that's what I'm from 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 I have been doing it for six months approx 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 videos on youtube and visum fits 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 mostly only commentary and let's play 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 yes and now come in the name of rat in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 That was my girlfriend who wanted 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 also mentioned are the aids on 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.979
 a channel on my channel active 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.890
 because she also makes comments as well 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 also let's play because we have one in front 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.299
 few days a week we have ours 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 both channels merged yes my 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.520
 the topic for you today is the whole 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 Prejudices against I say it 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.689
 killerspiel players yes the most 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 People always think only when the dirt 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.220
 a self-shooter think they always think 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 all the time just to Chin excel and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.420
 just wander around senselessly and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.710
 Well, that's something you can do 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.299
 of course so imagine if you have one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 you actually have team deathmatch as well 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.680
 only ballast rum 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.320
 but if you look at the games completely 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.200
 Look closely then it's a very big one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.070
 team thought behind it 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.310
 no pointless slaughter like for example 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.220
 the last contribution i made to parents in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.870
 net point net.de or something like that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.019
 therefore it is described that paintball 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.959
 I'm sure you all know the new game 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 the killer games player should be so 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.340
 but also practice the killing spree 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.180
 can simulate and your frustration 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.890
 let out 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.950
 well, leave that out with the foot 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.610
 I can still understand but that should 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.080
 no killing war simulation are 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 first of all honestly that is total 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.190
 nonsense which depending on life full left 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.380
 post brands im with balls of color rome and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.049
 up in the thick suit so that the interests 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.420
 and there was really a great set in the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.709
 wrong application if the wrong 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.160
 things can also be deadly 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.200
 deadly active color ball and there was 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.019
 I then also rubber rubber 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.000
 Did not shoot rubber boots because of the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.910
 I could not burst rubber bullets 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 and second, where are they supposed to be deadly? 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.049
 these are color balls you have yes 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.480
 extra armor so everything protection 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.670
 story and so hate why especially the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.620
 to be deadly I do not understand 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.150
 and of course that will be the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.220
 All parents do not even know 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.120
 from the matter again have to wrong 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.299
 That 's not what it's all about 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.700
 you to a runner so always this 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.139
 poverty restored as well as kolos 2 or 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.920
 have played call of duty windows 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.930
 gunman 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.389
 that's total idiocy that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.489
 also say yes i am some ponies and 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.060
 Then you come in type of swine flu 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.160
 and he had started a rampage then 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.019
 nobody says yes my angel pauli 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.639
 played that is a runaway that 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.010
 The game has to be done starting at 8th 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.299
 because of course nobody because simply 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.239
 all have no idea the whole 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.190
 politicians gave him everything and know 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.450
 Not at all why it works 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.310
 in this game actually had the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.310
 team thinking plays a big role and 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.680
 you can indeed the comments 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.329
 Write what you think like that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.370
 all the discussions in time always 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.379
 escalate 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.639
 and if you still live at home what 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.220
 Tell your parents when you are there 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.959
 So my thoughts are about you are 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.389
 you somehow continue to run something like that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.979
 from almost but I find that quite honest 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.449
 not funny because they just have 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.759
 no idea of â€‹â€‹the matter and 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.259
 claim again things and 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.479
 that is really hurtful and we will 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.150
 then again in all of them 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.130
 thrown together and will become us 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.360
 simply accused yes you are you 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.509
 everything just hopeless cases like rtl 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.740
 the gameplay now ends here too me 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.360
 I started in the middle because I just 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.870
 The scene in the beginning is so funny 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.699
 found 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.840
 and that was a little info video 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.150
 be with the short topic between 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.949
 pushed off with a 29 64 turn off 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.400
 I say goodbye to up then 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.400
 meet again
