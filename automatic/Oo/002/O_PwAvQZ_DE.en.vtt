00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it that way create habits that will help

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
it that way create habits that will help
them<00:02:28.319> under<00:02:28.590> pressure<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.209> things

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
them under pressure and then when things

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
them under pressure and then when things
don't<00:02:30.600> go<00:02:30.750> well<00:02:30.980> don't<00:02:31.980> turn<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.220> bad<00:02:32.430> plane<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
don't go well don't turn a bad plane to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.470 
don't go well don't turn a bad plane to
a<00:02:32.970> catastrophe<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> found<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> time

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
a catastrophe I found that all the time

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
a catastrophe I found that all the time
sometimes<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.380> bad<00:02:37.560> play<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.519> don't

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
sometimes it's just a bad play so don't

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.180 
sometimes it's just a bad play so don't
make<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.030> worse
