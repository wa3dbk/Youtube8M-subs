00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
64 7 that mint don't think we'll be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
64 7 that mint don't think we'll be
using<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> take<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
using it much right so if you take a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.889 
using it much right so if you take a
look<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> squad<00:00:45.270> right<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:45.660> you'll<00:00:45.840> see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
look at the squad right now you'll see

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.690 
look at the squad right now you'll see
there's<00:00:46.230> only<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.710> change<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.160> last<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.520> out

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
there's only one change in last time out

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
there's only one change in last time out
and<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> has<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> switching<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.780> Hernandez

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and that has the switching of Hernandez

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
and that has the switching of Hernandez
and<00:00:49.590> jermain<00:00:49.890> defoe<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.910> increases<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and jermain defoe just increases the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.670 
and jermain defoe just increases the
chemistry<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
chemistry by that little bit and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
chemistry by that little bit and
hopefully<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.579> makes<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:53.940> sort<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
hopefully it makes some sort of a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.639 
hopefully it makes some sort of a
difference<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:55.020> yeah<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.590> if

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
difference but yeah before we start if

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.720 
difference but yeah before we start if
