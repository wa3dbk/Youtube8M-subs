00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
your motherboard let's take a closer

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.770 
your motherboard let's take a closer
look<00:02:58.690> at<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.140> inside<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> case<00:02:59.830> here<00:03:00.040> now

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
look at the inside of the case here now

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.060 
look at the inside of the case here now
we<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:01.960> your<00:03:02.110> four<00:03:02.380> five<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.920> quarter

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
we have your four five and a quarter

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.060 
we have your four five and a quarter
inch<00:03:03.280> drives<00:03:04.020> now<00:03:05.020> they<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.530> two<00:03:05.860> lyst

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
inch drives now they have the two lyst

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.580 
inch drives now they have the two lyst
mounts<00:03:09.450> press<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.630> down<00:03:10.660> pull<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.110> back<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
mounts press that down pull it back and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.620 
mounts press that down pull it back and
then<00:03:12.190> essentially<00:03:12.550> this<00:03:12.790> would<00:03:13.000> come<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.360> but

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
then essentially this would come off but

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.220 
then essentially this would come off but
for<00:03:13.870> shipping<00:03:14.080> they're<00:03:14.350> screwed<00:03:14.560> into<00:03:14.710> place

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
for shipping they're screwed into place

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.460 
for shipping they're screwed into place
we<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.120> mounts<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.540> three<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
we have the mounts for the three and a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.960 
we have the mounts for the three and a
half<00:03:20.500> inch<00:03:20.860> drives<00:03:21.160> here<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:21.580> have<00:03:21.700> two<00:03:21.910> of

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
half inch drives here we have two of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.060 
half inch drives here we have two of
them<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.870> one<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.110> them<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.620> external

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
them so one of them is the external

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.820 
them so one of them is the external
another<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.610> internal<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.530> then<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.650> have

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
another one internal and then you have

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.949 
another one internal and then you have
your<00:03:26.860> four<00:03:27.370> three<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.420> half<00:03:28.480> inch<00:03:28.750> bays

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.040 
your four three and a half inch bays
down<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.770> which<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.250> can<00:03:30.430> use<00:03:30.459> those

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
down here which you can use those

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.280 
down here which you can use those

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
behind these two Bay's there's actually

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.199 
behind these two Bay's there's actually

this<00:03:56.020> side<00:03:56.080> you'll<00:03:56.530> notice<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.190> can<00:03:57.370> see

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
this side you'll notice that you can see

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.880 
this side you'll notice that you can see
your<00:03:57.820> 120<00:03:58.480> millimeter<00:03:58.840> fan<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.320> then<00:03:59.739> your

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
your 120 millimeter fan and then your

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.910 
your 120 millimeter fan and then your
PCI<00:04:00.220> expansion<00:04:00.610> slots<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:02.260> also<00:04:02.560> gives<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.830> a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
good view of this back panel here it's

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
good view of this back panel here it's
got<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.280> nice<00:04:06.489> cut<00:04:06.970> out<00:04:07.120> for<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.450> cpu<00:04:07.810> cooler

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
got a nice cut out for the cpu cooler

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.500 
got a nice cut out for the cpu cooler
all<00:04:08.620> finished<00:04:09.250> edges<00:04:09.580> on<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.880> inside<00:04:10.300> too
