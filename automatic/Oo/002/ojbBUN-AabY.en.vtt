jumpin<00:00:00.450> Jehoshaphat's<00:00:01.199> there's<00:00:01.530> red<00:00:01.800> behind

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
jumpin Jehoshaphat's there's red behind

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.500 
jumpin Jehoshaphat's there's red behind
me<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.429> guess<00:00:02.730> that<00:00:02.939> means<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.360> have<00:00:03.480> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
me I guess that means that we have a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.110 
me I guess that means that we have a
science<00:00:04.110> experiment<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.100> look<00:00:05.370> I'm<00:00:05.879> even

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
science experiment for you look I'm even

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.049 
science experiment for you look I'm even
using<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.540> tripod<00:00:07.040> it's<00:00:08.040> amazing

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
using a tripod it's amazing

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.360 
using a tripod it's amazing
back<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.570> day<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.960> used<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:11.010> used<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.309> do

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
back in the day we used to we used to do

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.650 
back in the day we used to we used to do
the<00:00:11.490> science<00:00:11.820> experiment<00:00:12.300> where<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.540> would

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the science experiment where we would

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.539 
the science experiment where we would
take<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.110> bottle<00:00:13.530> like<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> two-liter<00:00:14.250> bottle

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
take a bottle like a two-liter bottle

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.960 
take a bottle like a two-liter bottle
like<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.030> we'd<00:00:15.570> form<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.990> cloud<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
like this and we'd form a cloud in it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
like this and we'd form a cloud in it
never<00:00:17.970> been<00:00:18.210> able<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
never been able to do that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.620 
never been able to do that
ever<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> found<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.850> better<00:00:21.000> way<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> I'm

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
ever so I found a better way and I'm

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.609 
ever so I found a better way and I'm
going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> show<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.930> guys<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
going to show you guys how to do it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.269 
going to show you guys how to do it
it's<00:00:23.060> amazing<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.600> results<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:25.320> stupendous

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it's amazing the results are stupendous

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's amazing the results are stupendous
it<00:00:27.119> will<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:27.630> cloud<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.349> bottle

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it will be more cloud in this bottle

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
it will be more cloud in this bottle
than<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> sky<00:00:30.090> today

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
than there was in the sky today

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959 
than there was in the sky today
you<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.320> wait<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> easiest<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.610> about

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you just wait so the easiest thing about

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.020 
you just wait so the easiest thing about
there<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.050> secret<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there the the the secret to this is you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
there the the the secret to this is you
have<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.570> evaporation<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.500> on

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
have to have some evaporation going on

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
have to have some evaporation going on
in<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.280> doing<00:00:38.600> rubbing<00:00:39.600> alcohol

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
in there so we're doing rubbing alcohol

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
in there so we're doing rubbing alcohol
putting<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> rubbing

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
putting just a little bit of rubbing

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.930 
putting just a little bit of rubbing
alcohol<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:42.960> maybe<00:00:43.170> like

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
alcohol in there I don't know maybe like

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.529 
alcohol in there I don't know maybe like
a<00:00:45.050> -<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> maybe<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> tablespoon

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
a - what is that maybe like a tablespoon

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170 
a - what is that maybe like a tablespoon
or<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.610> let<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> start<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
or so and then we just let it start to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
or so and then we just let it start to
coat<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> outside<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:53.100> some

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
coat the outside there to get get some

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.060 
coat the outside there to get get some
evaporation<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.739> inside<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
evaporation going on inside of the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
evaporation going on inside of the
bottle<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.120> putting<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.420> real<00:00:57.570> thin<00:00:57.899> coat

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bottle so we're putting a real thin coat

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.549 
bottle so we're putting a real thin coat
of<00:00:58.789> alcohol<00:00:59.789> around<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> outside<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
of alcohol around the outside of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
of alcohol around the outside of the
bottle<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> easier<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
bottle then I make it easier for it to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.240 
bottle then I make it easier for it to
evaporate<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.150> super<00:01:06.600> secret

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
evaporate then we take my super secret

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
evaporate then we take my super secret
not<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.520> invention<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.299> somebody<00:01:09.930> else

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
not my invention at all somebody else

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
not my invention at all somebody else
thought<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.520> took<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:12.060> inner

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
thought this up but I just took an inner

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
thought this up but I just took an inner
tube<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> bike<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.860> cut<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
tube out of a bike and I cut off the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
tube out of a bike and I cut off the
valve<00:01:14.790> stem<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
valve stem just like that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.140 
valve stem just like that
and<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:18.030> put<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> inside<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> my<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:20.250> foot<00:01:20.700> foot

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and I put it inside of my my foot foot

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570 
and I put it inside of my my foot foot
pump<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.689> okay<00:01:22.560> here's<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> magics

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pump here okay here's where the magics

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
pump here okay here's where the magics
made<00:01:23.759> we're<00:01:24.060> gonna<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:25.080> gonna

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
made we're gonna take it we're gonna

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
made we're gonna take it we're gonna
make<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.530> high<00:01:25.710> pressure<00:01:26.040> inside<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
make some high pressure inside of this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
make some high pressure inside of this
bottle<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:28.860> high

comes the magic
boom<00:01:45.190> look<00:01:45.550> at<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.760> there's<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.390> cloud<00:01:46.660> right

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
boom look at that there's a cloud right

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.400 
boom look at that there's a cloud right
there<00:01:47.230> we<00:01:48.070> cloud<00:01:49.030> smoke<00:01:49.570> rings<00:01:49.840> coming<00:01:50.170> out<00:01:50.320> of

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
there we cloud smoke rings coming out of

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.430 
there we cloud smoke rings coming out of
the<00:01:50.470> cloud<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:52.330> then<00:01:52.600> say<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:52.960> wanted<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.260> get

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
the cloud and then say we wanted to get

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.150 
the cloud and then say we wanted to get
rid<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.710> cloud

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
rid of the cloud

that I was just a just mess around with
my<00:02:15.190> my<00:02:15.550> newfound<00:02:15.910> cloud<00:02:17.280> contraption<00:02:18.280> here

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
my my newfound cloud contraption here

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.420 
my my newfound cloud contraption here
and<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.630> found<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:21.010> only<00:02:21.070> does<00:02:21.400> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and I found out that not only does it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.210 
and I found out that not only does it
make<00:02:21.610> smoke<00:02:22.030> rings<00:02:22.300> coming<00:02:22.600> out<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> also

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
make smoke rings coming out but it also

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.360 
make smoke rings coming out but it also
makes<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:25.600> nada<00:02:25.930> smoke<00:02:26.440> rings<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.950> anti

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
smoke rings going in okay here we go we

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.680 
smoke rings going in okay here we go we
got<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> cloud<00:02:35.770> right<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.209> make<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
got a cloud right and now we make the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.600 
got a cloud right and now we make the
smoke<00:02:37.930> rings<00:02:38.170> coming<00:02:38.380> out<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> top<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.520> if

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
so you hook up your bike pump to it and

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.150 
so you hook up your bike pump to it and
then<00:03:31.600> stick<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.900> right<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.500> top<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.890> hold<00:03:33.040> it
