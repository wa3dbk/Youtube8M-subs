00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you with just the antenna you can get

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.570 
you with just the antenna you can get
about<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> six<00:01:15.090> inch<00:01:16.520> range<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:19.310> that's<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
about a six inch range and that's just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.130 
about a six inch range and that's just
hooked<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.299> buzzer<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.960> the

professional buzzing sound and our
electronic<00:01:24.840> door<00:01:24.990> strike

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.790 

being<00:01:29.480> it<00:01:29.630> was<00:01:29.720> by<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.930> front<00:01:30.260> door<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.470> was

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
being it was by the front door I was

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.670 
being it was by the front door I was
lucky<00:01:31.100> enough<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.460> have<00:01:31.840> 120<00:01:32.840> volt<00:01:33.020> power<00:01:33.260> here

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
lucky enough to have 120 volt power here

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920 
lucky enough to have 120 volt power here
right<00:01:34.160> at<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.970> wall<00:01:35.150> switches<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.780> had<00:01:35.900> a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
right at the the wall switches I had a

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.560 
right at the the wall switches I had a
hundred<00:01:36.170> neutral<00:01:36.620> that<00:01:36.740> was<00:01:36.830> on<00:01:36.950> all<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.130> time

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
hundred neutral that was on all the time

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.210 
hundred neutral that was on all the time
so<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.600> custom<00:01:39.020> modified<00:01:39.410> one<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.680> those<00:01:39.770> little

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
so I custom modified one of those little

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.100 
so I custom modified one of those little
switching<00:01:40.670> power<00:01:40.850> supply<00:01:41.330> it's<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> ones<00:01:41.930> you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
switching power supply it's the ones you

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.590 
switching power supply it's the ones you
get<00:01:42.260> well<00:01:43.130> specifically<00:01:43.730> it<00:01:43.910> was<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> Linksys

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
get well specifically it was a Linksys

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.500 
get well specifically it was a Linksys
12-volt<00:01:45.170> power<00:01:45.350> supply<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:46.160> switching<00:01:47.030> adapter

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
12-volt power supply a switching adapter

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.690 
12-volt power supply a switching adapter
there<00:01:47.660> we<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.560> modified<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.430> make<00:01:49.580> it

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
there we I modified it to make it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.030 
there we I modified it to make it
smaller<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.390> fit<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.780> there<00:01:51.020> insulated<00:01:51.950> it

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
smaller so it fit in there insulated it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.680 
smaller so it fit in there insulated it
and<00:01:52.220> that's<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.030> provides<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.480> power

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
and that's what provides a power

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.580 
and that's what provides a power
