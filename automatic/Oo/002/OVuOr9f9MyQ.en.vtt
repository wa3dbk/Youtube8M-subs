in past experiences anyway starting with

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.349 
in past experiences anyway starting with
the<00:00:04.920> kale<00:00:05.100> tips<00:00:05.370> which<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.940> probably<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the kale tips which is probably the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.150 
the kale tips which is probably the
lesser<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:06.960> two<00:00:07.049> Eagles<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.770> if<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.980> make

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
lesser of the two Eagles and if you make

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.549 
lesser of the two Eagles and if you make
kale<00:00:08.429> chips<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.849> home<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.200> healthy

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
kale chips at home with just healthy

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.709 
kale chips at home with just healthy
ingredients<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.550> think<00:00:12.179> they're<00:00:12.300> poly<00:00:12.570> all

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
ingredients I think they're poly all

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.970 
ingredients I think they're poly all
right<00:00:12.929> except<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> fact<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.769> they're

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
right except for the fact that they're

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.849 
right except for the fact that they're
missing<00:00:14.429> their<00:00:14.670> water<00:00:15.480> content<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.710> they're

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
missing their water content so they're

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.500 
missing their water content so they're
not<00:00:16.949> hydrating<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.970> body

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
not hydrating to your body

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.140 
not hydrating to your body
these<00:00:19.439> ones<00:00:19.800> however<00:00:21.560> they<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.850> first

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
these ones however they have the first

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.779 
these ones however they have the first
ingredient<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.869> kale<00:00:25.199> again<00:00:25.619> that's<00:00:25.859> fine

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
ingredient is kale again that's fine

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.480 
ingredient is kale again that's fine
then<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.840> cashews<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.830> cashews<00:00:29.340> are

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
then they have cashews now cashews are

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.389 
then they have cashews now cashews are
not<00:00:29.730> abroad<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.599> been<00:00:31.040> proven<00:00:32.040> several

we probably get our hands on for making

we probably get our hands on for making
this<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.489> stuff<00:00:38.870> they<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.440> heat

but maybe another video anyway the

cashews are not raw even if they were
raw<00:01:05.729> they're<00:01:06.210> high<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.600> fat<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:08.369> can

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
raw they're high in fat and that can

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
raw they're high in fat and that can
slow<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.960> sure<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.580> thing

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
slow you down for sure the other thing

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
slow you down for sure the other thing
in<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.710> lemon<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.159> Celtic<00:01:14.670> sea

salt<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.189> adding<00:01:17.549> souls

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
salt you know I don't think adding souls

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.289 
salt you know I don't think adding souls
is<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.960> idea<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.409> most<00:01:19.619> cases

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
is really good good idea in most cases

is really good good idea in most cases
agave<00:01:21.299> nectar

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
agave nectar

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
agave nectar
now<00:01:22.049> Gavi<00:01:22.350> nectar<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.130> wrong<00:01:23.369> either<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
now Gavi nectar is not wrong either I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
now Gavi nectar is not wrong either I
mean<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.390> no<00:01:24.770> person<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.040> just

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
mean there's no person that can just

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.569 
mean there's no person that can just
pick<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.880> agave<00:01:27.180> plant<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.579> somehow

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
pick up an agave plant out and somehow

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.030 
pick up an agave plant out and somehow
create<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> syrup<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
create a syrup from that it's a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
create a syrup from that it's a
sweetener<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.200> kind

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sweetener so there has to be some kind

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.160 
sweetener so there has to be some kind
of<00:01:34.820> intense<00:01:35.820> processing<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> make<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.840> gobby

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
of intense processing to make a gobby

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
of intense processing to make a gobby
syrup<00:01:37.619> sweet<00:01:37.920> enough<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.820> used

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
syrup sweet enough to actually be used

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
syrup sweet enough to actually be used
as<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:41.960> concentrated<00:01:42.960> sweetener<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.759> don't

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
as a concentrated sweetener and I don't

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
as a concentrated sweetener and I don't
even<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.119> why<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.360> savory<00:01:46.110> kale<00:01:46.470> chips

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
even know why these savory kale chips

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.060 
even know why these savory kale chips
have<00:01:46.979> any<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> sweetener<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:48.180> but

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
have any kind of sweetener on them but

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
have any kind of sweetener on them but
agave<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.220> definitely

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
agave is definitely

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
agave is definitely
not<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.530> idea<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.670> put<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.090> body<00:01:54.210> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
not a good idea to put in your body and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.350 
not a good idea to put in your body and
I<00:01:54.810> always<00:01:55.110> notice<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> difference<00:01:56.040> a
