00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
what we today as this little sucker will

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.470 
what we today as this little sucker will
go<00:00:50.860> in<00:00:51.040> here<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.580> a<00:00:51.610> camera<00:00:52.059> position

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
go in here this is a camera position

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.619 
go in here this is a camera position
which<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:52.870> installed<00:00:53.970> into<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.000> bunker<00:00:55.390> face

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
which we installed into the bunker face

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.600 
which we installed into the bunker face
through<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.930> one<00:00:56.110> from<00:00:56.320> one<00:00:56.500> set<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.340> idea

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
through the one from one set so the idea

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.220 
through the one from one set so the idea
of<00:00:57.700> that<00:00:57.910> says<00:00:58.150> that<00:00:58.450> they'd<00:00:58.870> be<00:00:59.080> on<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
of that says that they'd be on the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.410 
of that says that they'd be on the
championship<00:00:59.680> they'll<00:01:00.130> install<00:01:00.700> a<00:01:00.970> small

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
championship they'll install a small

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.770 
championship they'll install a small
camera<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:02.020> here<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:02.950> any<00:01:03.280> player<00:01:03.780> visits

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
camera in here so that any player visits

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.359 
camera in here so that any player visits
this<00:01:04.960> bunker<00:01:05.500> they'll<00:01:05.830> be<00:01:05.979> able<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.160> get<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
this bunker they'll be able to get the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.580 
this bunker they'll be able to get the
images<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.910> them<00:01:07.180> trying<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.840> get<00:01:08.050> bit<00:01:08.350> that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
images of them trying to get bit that

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.890 
images of them trying to get bit that
the<00:01:08.710> ball<00:01:08.950> bucket<00:01:09.460> previous<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.690> last

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
the ball bucket previous to the last

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.590 
the ball bucket previous to the last
Open<00:01:11.290> Championship<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.330> assisted<00:01:13.330> in<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
Open Championship we assisted in the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.469 
Open Championship we assisted in the
installation<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.590> our<00:01:14.650> major<00:01:15.490> fiber<00:01:15.970> optic

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
installation of our major fiber optic

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.690 
installation of our major fiber optic
cabling<00:01:17.020> great<00:01:17.710> run<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> perimeter<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.550> the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
cabling great run the perimeter of the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.609 
cabling great run the perimeter of the
golf<00:01:18.910> course<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> idea<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.080> that

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
golf course so the idea of that is that

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.680 
golf course so the idea of that is that
you<00:01:21.100> know<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.250> we've<00:01:22.000> tough<00:01:22.210> end<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
you know that we've tough end to the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.230 
you know that we've tough end to the
fiber<00:01:22.930> optic<00:01:23.320> cable<00:01:23.680> fiber<00:01:23.890> optic<00:01:24.280> cable<00:01:24.670> will

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
fiber optic cable fiber optic cable will

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.820 
fiber optic cable fiber optic cable will
then<00:01:25.420> run<00:01:25.660> underground<00:01:26.020> through<00:01:26.470> doctor

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
then run underground through doctor

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.550 
then run underground through doctor
systems<00:01:27.250> coming<00:01:28.119> out<00:01:28.300> at<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.570> other<00:01:28.630> end<00:01:28.899> so

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
systems coming out at the other end so

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.320 
systems coming out at the other end so
then<00:01:29.679> we'll<00:01:29.830> have<00:01:29.860> minimal<00:01:30.399> cables<00:01:31.119> at

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
then we'll have minimal cables at

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.749 
then we'll have minimal cables at
Wireless<00:01:31.869> office<00:01:32.289> and<00:01:32.530> not<00:01:33.069> minimal<00:01:33.399> cables

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
Wireless office and not minimal cables

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.760 
Wireless office and not minimal cables
will<00:01:33.910> then<00:01:34.060> tap<00:01:34.450> end<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.289> cameras

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
will then tap end to it to the cameras

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.160 
will then tap end to it to the cameras
on<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.009> tower<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.850> project<00:01:37.210> images<00:01:37.420> are<00:01:38.020> in

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
on the tower to project images are in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.960 
on the tower to project images are in
the<00:01:38.289> world<00:01:38.470> there's<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.340> moment<00:01:39.759> where<00:01:39.940> I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
the world there's a moment where I

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.840
