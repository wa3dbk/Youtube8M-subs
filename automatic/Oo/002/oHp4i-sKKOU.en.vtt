00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.569 
change it into string skipping or you
can<00:00:49.140> start<00:00:49.410> playing<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.769> backwards<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.430> can

I'll do the other sort of ideas I have
in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> next<00:00:58.409> video<00:00:58.559> ok<00:00:59.220> so<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.550> set<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in the next video ok so just set up the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
in the next video ok so just set up the
the<00:01:00.420> metronome<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.379> idea<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the metronome and the idea is you just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
the metronome and the idea is you just
start<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.790> slow<00:01:03.089> speed<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.750> sure<00:01:03.930> all

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
start with the slow speed make sure all

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
start with the slow speed make sure all
your<00:01:04.259> fingering<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> correct<00:01:05.190> make<00:01:05.399> sure<00:01:05.519> your

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
your fingering is correct make sure your

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.889 
your fingering is correct make sure your
fingers<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:05.940> close<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.390> strings<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
fingers are close to the strings and

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.630 
fingers are close to the strings and
then<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.560> move<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.520> I'll

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
then just move on from there so I'll

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.540 
then just move on from there so I'll
just<00:01:08.670> start<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
just start so now that we have the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.300 
just start so now that we have the
metronome<00:01:14.940> going<00:01:15.149> home<00:01:15.270> oh<00:01:16.039> listen<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
metronome going home oh listen to the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.380 
metronome going home oh listen to the
click<00:01:17.550> Oh<00:01:17.789> tap<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.869> foot<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> bed<00:01:19.380> oh<00:01:20.390> and
