00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.680
 Hello here is Steffen for area mobile 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.870
 and we have the next test report 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.180
 for you and this time a tablet 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 and you can see a windows right away 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.320
 tablet the lenovo thinkpad tablet eight 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
 the thinkpad series is the business 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.009
 of lenovo but can of course 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 Everyone buying now is normal 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.539
 only on a few peculiarities and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 especially the design and I want that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529
 Imagine a little closer 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 that's why you come on 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 on the lenovo thinkpad tablet 8 we have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.199
 it as the name implies with an 8 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.659
 inch big display to do so in the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.449
 have diagonal 8 inches at the resolution 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:47.040
 we even have a full hd 2 one 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.839
 a bit more, namely 1920 pixels x 1200 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.540
 So it is very high resolution 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.010
 display and we also like it in the test 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.799
 Pretty good colors come very well 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 over that is an ips-panel that means 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.699
 we have pretty good 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 viewing angle stability and very much 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.519
 natural colors the brightness pleases 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.680
 We are also very good 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.270
 and of course, of course, too 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.860
 good on the finger reacts too 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.920
 No problems at all 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 test finger gestures all no 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 That's why it recognizes up to ten fingers 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990
 at the same time as usual 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 is 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.299
 and there is nothing to moan about and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 First look at the back 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.520
 that is pretty nice that is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.049
 here's a rough aluminum built up 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.719
 that feels great too is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.520
 this thinkpad is beautifully processed 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.369
 Lettering we from this business 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 Notebooks also know with this point 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.149
 the lights up just when the tablet in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 use is still a few small ones 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.890
 other details such as around 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.100
 the 2 megapixel camera is such a round one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.039
 red accent around a led lightning the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.950
 Camera is nice too 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.579
 synonymous something like the mini hdmi port the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.710
 we have here 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.719
 here are little pieces hidden under the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.299
 the memory card is the thinkpad 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.819
 tablet 8 is also available as a version with 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.619
 I mean mobile and then there is too 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.069
 The sim under it I can do that here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.060
 briefly show where she comes from 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.300
 memory card in and here is next 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 just space for another slot the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.510
 shut up here is a bit happier 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.269
 such a soft rubber plastic 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 but it fits quite well with 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.120
 the other side we only have the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.159
 usual switch actually the loud 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.760
 and quietly the run is unfortunately the 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.890
 power button 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.530
 and here is the usb 3 port that 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.939
 Of course, that is very pleasant for people 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.709
 often pushing big files back and forth 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.610
 must and have the us p3 hard disk 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.470
 that will of course be clear 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.579
 more quickly 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.950
 the internal memory is here however 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.099
 in our test device only 32 gb big 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.640
 But there are even 128 in total 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.530
 gigabyte internal memory nice flat 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 the thing also that we are just 9 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.890
 millimeters thick and weighs approximately 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.599
 little more than 400 grams 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.890
 you can do that very well in the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.440
 pants pocket and still 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.609
 take it with you but that's still possible 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.260
 Of course, it is not that easy 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.209
 like maybe nexus 7 but what 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.739
 of course, a tick is less here 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 still had the speaker or 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.319
 the two speakers and the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.150
 headphones port the speakers are now 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.440
 yes not very well done and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.090
 because they are only behind 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.590
 Of course they radiate backwards 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.840
 which means I need to move forward 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.030
 the volume but overall that's it 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.010
 in order 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.260
 Windows 8 is on top of it 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.040
 with an Intel processor 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.359
 of course because we have it with the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.150
 to do proper windows and not with 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.599
 the poor variant windows nt in here 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.129
 there is an intel z 37 70 with 2 4 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.470
 gigahertz clock frequency and four 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.230
 rake cores that's pretty good 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.940
 the memory is at 2 gb unfortunately 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.319
 only two gigabytes, there are none 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.449
 possibility to upgrade it, I find one 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.799
 a pity because the processor 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.709
 actually has a lot of power 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.060
 but let's say bigger ones 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.260
 Applications it might be now and then 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.449
 quite nice if that at least the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.329
 possibility would have if I know so 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:57.310
 what more often I just get to get 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.709
 what you have at least four gigabytes of ram 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.239
 then, for example, for image editing 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.010
 or any video clip or similar 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.269
 things for that actually, of course 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.079
 not thought but maybe it works 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.599
 want to do it again 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.889
 I can be better equipped here 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.349
 not only work the tile surface 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.540
 but also has normal in the desktop 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.099
 but not really for the fingers 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.690
 Optimized that one already knows from 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.000
 other windows devices with touchscreen 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.470
 and above all by the high resolution 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.389
 here are mainly writing and symbols 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
 in the standard setting relatively small 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.620
 Of course I can change that as well 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.360
 I want that but I have it here 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.289
 sometimes that's just the problem 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.419
 to meet right 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.560
 that's the same with the menus up here 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.750
 how much you already see or here 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.700
 crossing the tax that's just not 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.620
 quite so easy but there can be too 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.960
 at any time a mouse subsequent 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.280
 Connecting the keyboard and the entire flat 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.130
 stuck in the docking station or 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360
 maybe more in the envelope with me 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.750
 that somehow can put up that way and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.460
 then you can be reasonably reasonable 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.300
 collaborate 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.880
 Overall, the device is really running 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.500
 liquid the thinkpad tablet has enough 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.430
 performance for everything I could 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.650
 want to do it 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.330
 The battery in here is loud 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.979
 lenovo has a term of eight hours 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.320
 have the exact capacity there 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.700
 manufacturer not available 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.930
 that comes naturally out about the 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.090
 Of course you can also do it for everything 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.080
 say because I have a windows tablet 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.789
 Of course I have many options 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.380
 can do different things 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.900
 all the time play videos only watch 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.880
 just surf now and then something with it 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.919
 that's why it's a little bit 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.050
 difficult to say I need it 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.389
 and so I'm coming for so long paragraphs 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.979
 clear but eight hours should 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.020
 so in mixed operation with a bit 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.990
 Music was a bit of a surf and stuff 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.779
 I would now think easily 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.310
 but the device is meant as a substitute for 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.469
 my notebook or maybe even 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.550
 the computer at home to create the 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.529
 Sun is actually again 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.940
 consider it because it is just a 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.909
 a bit limited 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.500
 it has only one usb port so something 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.659
 I need to have any connection 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.219
 a docking station or similar and 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.650
 Of course, I also have a monitor 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.270
 connect that will be quite a 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.979
 cable work especially was just the hdmi 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.650
 output of one side of usb us can 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.919
 So it's good for it there 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.120
 nothing but just for something on the way 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.440
 it is a nice work to work 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.479
 form factor the man really well 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.919
 like it if you just want that 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.870
 in fact almost still in the pants pocket 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.940
 but gets a complete windows 8 has 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.889
 with a fast processor what 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.510
 reasonable and where I all just 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.260
 I can do all the programs I can 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.029
 I need it and I'm used to it 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.620
 what is left of the lenovo thinkpad 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.870
 tablet eight I really think so 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.820
 exciting device because it is for such a 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.150
 compact windows tablet just pretty 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.950
 bring a lot of performance 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.560
 although it only has 2 GB of RAM 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.020
 I also like the display super 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.000
 the aluminum back so optically 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.160
 great device clearly there are cheaper ones 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.720
 Tablets meanwhile in the class but 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.490
 Here you have a pretty good one 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800
 fast processor and that is why 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.360
 price is absolutely justified one must 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.240
 Just know for home as 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.920
 pc replacement can not just not do something like that 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.660
 consistently knows too many for it 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.400
 The disadvantages simply by the 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.170
 Form factor are conditional that's what 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.670
 process on the way if necessary 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.260
 still with a keyboard to it and 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.120
 maybe a stand or something 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.380
 then you can do it wonderfully 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.510
 do things 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.160
 yes you still like to look up here
