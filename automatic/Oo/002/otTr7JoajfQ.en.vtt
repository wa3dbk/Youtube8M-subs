00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and it's a tricky puzzle they don't get

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.520 
and it's a tricky puzzle they don't get
much<00:00:09.330> trickier<00:00:09.570> actually<00:00:10.170> throughout<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
much trickier actually throughout the

you've had a look at it this afternoon

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.890 
you've had a look at it this afternoon
you've<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> five<00:00:17.910> days<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.449> today

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
you've got the five days in today

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.189 
you've got the five days in today
what's<00:00:19.680> winking<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.250> ya<00:00:20.779> it's<00:00:21.779> still<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
what's winking at ya it's still it's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
what's winking at ya it's still it's
none<00:00:22.380> completely<00:00:22.830> jigsaws<00:00:23.250> no<00:00:23.519> because

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
none completely jigsaws no because

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
none completely jigsaws no because
you've<00:00:23.760> got<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.029> sort<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.840> think

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you've got this sort of like I think

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.420 
you've got this sort of like I think
we're<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> ground<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.340> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
we're right with the ground we know it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.830 
we're right with the ground we know it's
gonna<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:26.849> decent<00:00:27.029> ground<00:00:27.359> whatever<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
gonna be some decent ground whatever I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
gonna be some decent ground whatever I
think<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> forecast<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.789> there's<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
think with a forecast but there's just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
think with a forecast but there's just
some<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:31.050> corner<00:00:31.380> pieces<00:00:31.800> other<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.219> drawn

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
some the corner pieces other so drawn

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
some the corner pieces other so drawn
they<00:00:32.820> said<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> be

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they said like you know do we want to be

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.630 
they said like you know do we want to be
high<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.950> ought<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.219> low

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
high do we ought to be low

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.979 
high do we ought to be low
we<00:00:36.000> certainly<00:00:36.180> probably<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> be

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
we certainly probably don't want to be

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.000 
we certainly probably don't want to be
in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> middle<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:39.500> last<00:00:40.500> year<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:40.890> all

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
in the middle so like last year was all

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
in the middle so like last year was all
high<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.360> probably<00:00:42.360> what's<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.750> similar

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
high on probably what's gonna be similar

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330 
high on probably what's gonna be similar
ground<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.469> were<00:00:43.559> high<00:00:43.710> numbers<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
ground they were high numbers that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.569 
ground they were high numbers that
dominated<00:00:44.760> okay<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> experts

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
dominated okay but as all the experts

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.740 
dominated okay but as all the experts
will<00:00:47.730> tell<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.270> where's<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
will tell you like you know where's the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.029 
will tell you like you know where's the
pace<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> race<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.770> other<00:00:49.950> things

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pace in the race all these other things

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
pace in the race all these other things
but<00:00:50.250> yeah<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.270> hopefully

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
but yeah I think you know hopefully

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
but yeah I think you know hopefully
whatever<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> tell<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.100> hopefully

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
whatever I'm about to tell you hopefully

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.130 
whatever I'm about to tell you hopefully
if<00:00:53.640> they've<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.149> double-figure<00:00:54.750> well

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
if they've got some double-figure well

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340 
if they've got some double-figure well
yeah<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.649> they've<00:00:55.949> got<00:00:56.100> 16<00:00:56.820> 17<00:00:57.239> 18<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.719> 22<00:00:57.989> on

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
yeah so they've got 16 17 18 to 22 on

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.880 
yeah so they've got 16 17 18 to 22 on
their<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.829> their<00:00:59.010> served<00:00:59.280> raw<00:00:59.760> number<00:01:00.180> then

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
their on their served raw number then

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.990 
their on their served raw number then
from<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:02.070> take<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> I'm

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
from me take you from me that I'm

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
from me take you from me that I'm
doubling<00:01:03.329> my<00:01:03.390> interest<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.979> they

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
doubling my interest in them so if they

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
doubling my interest in them so if they
haven't<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> say

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
haven't would you say what would you say

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
haven't would you say what would you say
ignore<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> easy<00:01:09.420> no<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> mean

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
ignore them or take it easy no I mean

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.210 
ignore them or take it easy no I mean
I'll<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.710> started<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> see

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I'll just see what we started to see

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
I'll just see what we started to see
where<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.430> enough<00:01:11.580> pacing<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.479> their

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
where there's enough pacing on their

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
where there's enough pacing on their
side<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.140> carry<00:01:13.380> them<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.650> their<00:01:13.830> race<00:01:14.010> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
side to carry them into their race but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
side to carry them into their race but
again<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.850> there's<00:01:15.270> 20<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> run<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> race

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
again you know there's 20 to run a race

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
again you know there's 20 to run a race
if<00:01:16.560> they're<00:01:16.920> drawn<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.759> 10<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.479> 14<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
if they're drawn so like 10 to 14 so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
if they're drawn so like 10 to 14 so
thing<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.740> I'll<00:01:19.830> probably<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.090> bit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thing then I'll probably go a little bit

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
thing then I'll probably go a little bit
sort<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.659> against<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.439> yeah<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.189> if

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
sort of like against them yeah but if

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.800 
sort of like against them yeah but if
they're<00:01:23.400> ghost<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> rail<00:01:24.090> side<00:01:24.330> draw<00:01:24.540> either

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
they're ghost of a rail side draw either

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260 
they're ghost of a rail side draw either
side<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:26.100> i<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.610> form<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.180> they've

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
side if i if I'm form I think they've

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
side if i if I'm form I think they've
got<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> chance<00:01:27.600> I'll<00:01:27.900> still<00:01:28.080> back<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
got a chance I'll still back them and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
got a chance I'll still back them and
hopefully<00:01:28.820> whichever<00:01:29.820> side's<00:01:30.090> deemed<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
hopefully whichever side's deemed or

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
hopefully whichever side's deemed or
thought<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> worst<00:01:31.619> side<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.159> you'll

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
thought to be the worst side then you'll

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.620 
thought to be the worst side then you'll
get<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> price<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
get a bit of price about okay so the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
get a bit of price about okay so the
draws<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.990> Thursday<00:01:34.439> isn't<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.009> right

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
draws on Thursday isn't it that's right

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760 
draws on Thursday isn't it that's right
yeah<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> yes<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> wouldn't<00:01:37.500> advise

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
yeah it is and yes if I wouldn't advise

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
yeah it is and yes if I wouldn't advise
anyone<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.340> dipping<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> yet<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.509> don't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
anyone to go dipping in yet so I don't

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.100 
anyone to go dipping in yet so I don't
know<00:01:39.990> okay<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.899> which<00:01:42.899> one

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
know okay all right then so which one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.889 
know okay all right then so which one
you<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.649> come<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.009> top<00:01:44.899> well

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
you just think will come out on top well

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
you just think will come out on top well
so<00:01:46.140> I've<00:01:46.409> narrowed<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so I've narrowed it down I think the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
so I've narrowed it down I think the
most<00:01:48.479> interesting<00:01:48.780> running<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> race<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
most interesting running in the race is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.770 
most interesting running in the race is

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
probably about the right price

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.730 
probably about the right price
personally<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.750> don't<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> bad<00:02:38.500> record

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
personally and I don't have a bad record

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.110 
personally and I don't have a bad record
in<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> link<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.940> horses

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
in the link and I like to have horses

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.090 
in the link and I like to have horses
that<00:02:40.450> I've<00:02:40.570> got<00:02:40.750> since<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.530> all-weather<00:02:41.770> came

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that I've got since the all-weather came

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.000 
that I've got since the all-weather came
in<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.270> with<00:02:43.690> Dubai<00:02:43.990> as<00:02:44.200> well<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.680> horses

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
in and with Dubai as well I like horses

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.210 
in and with Dubai as well I like horses
at<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> race<00:02:45.790> fit<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.810> revved<00:02:47.080> up<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.530> think

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
at a race fit you know revved up I think

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.800 
at a race fit you know revved up I think
they've<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.490> quite<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> good<00:02:49.300> record<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
they've got quite a good record in the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.510 
they've got quite a good record in the
race<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.470> they<00:02:50.680> might<00:02:50.830> not<00:02:50.980> be<00:02:51.100> quite<00:02:51.310> good

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
race and they might not be quite good

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.449 
race and they might not be quite good
enough<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.620> they've<00:02:53.620> got<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
enough but because they've got a bit of

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.960 
enough but because they've got a bit of
a<00:02:54.520> chance

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
a chance

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.720 
a chance
Cuoco<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:55.990> Hassan's<00:02:56.440> exactly<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.430> that's<00:02:57.580> just

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
Cuoco so Hassan's exactly so that's just

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.560 
Cuoco so Hassan's exactly so that's just
the<00:02:57.880> one<00:02:58.060> slight<00:02:58.780> negative<00:02:59.350> about<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.880> think

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the one slight negative about it I think

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.570 
the one slight negative about it I think
start<00:03:01.840> writes<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.170> best<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.680> go<00:03:02.830> dolphin

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
start writes the best of the go dolphin

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.190 
start writes the best of the go dolphin
to<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.120> Sahib<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.570> Syria<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.930> think<00:03:05.080> it's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
to of from Sahib in Syria I think it's

eye<00:04:34.270> early<00:04:34.930> last<00:04:35.110> year<00:04:35.820> in<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.090> spring<00:04:37.480> mile

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
eye early last year in the spring mile

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.840 
eye early last year in the spring mile
and<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.590> dotted<00:04:38.800> up<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.370> jaw

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
and so that dotted up in that jaw

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.620 
and so that dotted up in that jaw
stirred<00:04:40.030> up<00:04:40.090> again<00:04:40.180> at<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.390> end<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.570> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
stirred up again at the end of the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.080 
stirred up again at the end of the
season<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:41.260> he's<00:04:41.610> consequently<00:04:42.610> he's<00:04:42.790> off

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
season but he's consequently he's off

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.300 
season but he's consequently he's off
his<00:04:43.240> highest<00:04:43.600> mark<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.170> don't<00:04:44.740> see<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.100> much

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
his highest mark I don't see that much

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.770 
his highest mark I don't see that much
more<00:04:45.490> improvement<00:04:45.880> anything<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.270> think<00:04:46.360> he's

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
more improvement anything I think he's

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.960 
more improvement anything I think he's
got<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:46.990> find<00:04:47.200> more<00:04:47.440> with<00:04:48.130> these<00:04:48.310> dark<00:04:48.610> horses

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
got to find more with these dark horses

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.490 
got to find more with these dark horses
in<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.300> race<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.690> could<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:49.960> know<00:04:50.080> these

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
in the race that could you know these

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.040 
in the race that could you know these
black<00:04:50.980> type<00:04:51.220> horses<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.600> think<00:04:52.690> he's<00:04:52.840> got<00:04:53.020> to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
black type horses so I think he's got to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.120 
black type horses so I think he's got to
improve<00:04:53.350> again<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.620> think<00:04:53.770> it's<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.010> wrong

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
improve again I think it's the wrong

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.470 
improve again I think it's the wrong
price<00:04:54.400> they<00:04:54.700> shouldn't<00:04:54.970> believe<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.270> price

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
price they shouldn't believe that price

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.240 
price they shouldn't believe that price
she<00:04:55.630> should<00:04:55.780> be<00:04:55.900> double<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.290> price<00:04:56.320> fury

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
she should be double that price fury

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.950 
she should be double that price fury

Black<00:04:59.230> Sea<00:04:59.410> more<00:04:59.590> rain<00:04:59.800> for<00:05:00.040> him<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.370> agree<00:05:00.790> with

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
Black Sea more rain for him I agree with

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.120 
Black Sea more rain for him I agree with
that<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.510> think<00:05:01.780> you<00:05:01.840> know<00:05:01.960> if<00:05:02.200> he<00:05:02.620> lost<00:05:02.800> his<00:05:02.980> way

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
that I think you know if he lost his way

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.950 
that I think you know if he lost his way
towards<00:05:03.490> into<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.760> last<00:05:03.910> season<00:05:04.420> having

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
towards into the last season having

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.390 
towards into the last season having
started<00:05:05.470> reasonably<00:05:05.950> well<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.250> think

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
started reasonably well but I think

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.270 
started reasonably well but I think
still<00:05:06.790> again<00:05:07.030> rated<00:05:07.630> 98<00:05:08.080> he's<00:05:08.920> right<00:05:09.130> at<00:05:09.190> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
still again rated 98 he's right at the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.890 
still again rated 98 he's right at the
top<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.610> where<00:05:09.730> he<00:05:09.820> should<00:05:09.970> be<00:05:10.000> okay<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:10.630> you're

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
top of where he should be okay so you're

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.740 
top of where he should be okay so you're
three<00:05:11.050> against<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.410> feel<00:05:11.620> then<00:05:11.830> ARCA<00:05:12.340> cosas

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
three against the feel then ARCA cosas

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
yep that's how you get a good draw for

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.700 
yep that's how you get a good draw for
any<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.460> those<00:05:18.580> three<00:05:18.880> W<00:05:19.690> stake<00:05:19.930> exactly<00:05:20.560> those

any of those three W stake exactly those
are<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.890> three<00:05:21.070> I'm<00:05:21.130> waiting<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.430> see<00:05:21.490> what

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
are the three I'm waiting to see what

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.910 
are the three I'm waiting to see what
they<00:05:21.820> get<00:05:21.940> drawn<00:05:22.210> if<00:05:22.690> one<00:05:22.900> gets<00:05:23.110> drawn<00:05:23.350> 22<00:05:23.800> or

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
they get drawn if one gets drawn 22 or

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.190 
they get drawn if one gets drawn 22 or
22<00:05:24.370> I'll<00:05:24.640> probably<00:05:24.910> treble<00:05:25.330> my<00:05:25.420> bet<00:05:25.600> if<00:05:25.810> they

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
22 I'll probably treble my bet if they

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.660 
22 I'll probably treble my bet if they
get<00:05:26.350> drawn<00:05:26.530> in<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.740> twenties<00:05:27.160> they're

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
get drawn in the twenties they're

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.160 
get drawn in the twenties they're
definitely<00:05:27.880> worth<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.360> bit<00:05:28.540> but<00:05:28.780> even<00:05:28.900> if<00:05:29.080> they

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
definitely worth a bit but even if they

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.620 
definitely worth a bit but even if they
get<00:05:29.290> drawn<00:05:29.470> one<00:05:29.680> two<00:05:29.890> or<00:05:30.040> three<00:05:30.070> or<00:05:30.820> one<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.240> six

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
get drawn one two or three or one to six

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.930 
get drawn one two or three or one to six
I'd<00:05:32.530> still<00:05:32.830> have<00:05:32.950> a<00:05:33.010> little<00:05:33.160> go<00:05:33.400> if<00:05:33.550> this<00:05:33.700> pace

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
I'd still have a little go if this pace

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.730 
I'd still have a little go if this pace
that<00:05:34.240> side<00:05:34.480> that<00:05:34.720> will<00:05:34.870> take<00:05:35.110> them<00:05:35.260> along<00:05:35.470> into

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
that side that will take them along into

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:45.200 
that side that will take them along into
the<00:05:35.830> race<00:05:35.980> yeah<00:05:36.310> okay
