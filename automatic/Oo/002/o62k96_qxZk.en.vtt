00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
of course if you're not familiar with

of course if you're not familiar with
airplanes<00:02:15.819> when<00:02:16.060> we're<00:02:16.209> talking<00:02:16.330> about<00:02:16.540> flaps

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
airplanes when we're talking about flaps

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.539 
airplanes when we're talking about flaps
those<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.530> things<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> sticking<00:02:18.280> out<00:02:18.430> to

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
those are things with a sticking out to

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.580 
those are things with a sticking out to
the<00:02:18.670> back<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:19.000> wing<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> what<00:02:19.870> they<00:02:19.989> do<00:02:20.049> is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the back of the wing and what they do is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.770 
the back of the wing and what they do is
to<00:02:20.830> increase<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.940> width<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.569> wing

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
to increase the the width of the wing

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.649 
to increase the the width of the wing
and<00:02:23.650> also<00:02:24.250> increase<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.790> curvature<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.390> it

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
and also increase the curvature of it

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.360 
and also increase the curvature of it
and<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.110> does<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.620> mean<00:02:26.799> more<00:02:27.040> lift

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and what that does is to mean more lift

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.920 
and what that does is to mean more lift
from<00:02:27.700> less<00:02:28.299> speed<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:30.010> look<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.750> is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
from less speed now look at this this is

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:50.820 
from less speed now look at this this is
just<00:02:32.260> smashing

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:05.970
