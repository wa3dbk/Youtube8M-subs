00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.930
 Our correspondent Dushanbe Elena Kim all 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.179
 starts with a useful fruit filling 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.380

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.470
 we try ourselves 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 neatly neatly important we have apricot 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.100

 milk and sugar process a mixture of three 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.920
 hours so that the chocolate becomes tender 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.980
 the resulting mass is heated to 42 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 degrees and then sharply cooled 25 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.590
 glossy does not crumble after chocolate 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.590
