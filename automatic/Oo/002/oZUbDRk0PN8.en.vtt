and it's always awesome to see it go

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.149 
and it's always awesome to see it go
into<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.930> extra<00:01:46.409> hundred<00:01:46.799> slot<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:49.159> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
into that extra hundred slot so that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.330 
into that extra hundred slot so that's
not<00:01:50.369> bad<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.970> we're<00:01:51.149> halfway<00:01:51.329> through<00:01:51.560> will<00:01:52.560> we

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
not bad so we're halfway through will we

depending on what prices do is what

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.859 
depending on what prices do is what
depends<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.729> much<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.509> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
depends on on how much will get if you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.139 
depends on on how much will get if you
guys<00:02:04.079> double<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.280> won't<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> fair

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
guys double this that won't be a fair

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.910 
guys double this that won't be a fair
estimate<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:06.840> many<00:02:07.259> keys<00:02:07.560> i'm<00:02:07.740> actually

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
estimate on how many keys i'm actually

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.339 
estimate on how many keys i'm actually
going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.429> achieve<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.750> keys<00:02:10.020> are

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
going to achieve because the keys are
