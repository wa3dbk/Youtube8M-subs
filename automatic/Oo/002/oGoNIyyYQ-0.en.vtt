00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that you could just watch Kevin Hart

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
that you could just watch Kevin Hart
talk<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.000> Kevin<00:01:33.270> Hart<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.600> an<00:01:33.689> hour<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
talk as Kevin Hart for an hour what is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
talk as Kevin Hart for an hour what is
he<00:01:34.500> he's<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.829> never<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.220> funny<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.520> movies<00:01:35.909> as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
he he's just never as funny in movies as

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
he he's just never as funny in movies as
he<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> script<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.350> never

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
he really is and the script can never

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 
he really is and the script can never
really<00:01:37.740> live<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.520> funny<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really live up to how funny he is and I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.429 
really live up to how funny he is and I
think<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> movie<00:01:39.810> does<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.229> both<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
think the movie does that with both of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
think the movie does that with both of
them<00:01:40.680> Wilf<00:01:40.920> Will<00:01:41.310> Ferrell<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> Kevin<00:01:42.540> Hart

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
them Wilf Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
them Wilf Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart
are<00:01:42.810> both<00:01:42.990> funnier<00:01:43.439> than<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> movie<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.220> think

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
are both funnier than this movie I think

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.889 
are both funnier than this movie I think
that<00:01:44.790> Kevin<00:01:44.939> Hart<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.720> guys

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that Kevin Hart is one of those guys

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.420 
that Kevin Hart is one of those guys
that<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.590> gave<00:01:46.829> him<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.189> screen

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that if they gave him more screen

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
that if they gave him more screen
presence<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.180> let<00:01:48.360> him<00:01:48.509> interact<00:01:49.020> more

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
presence and they let him interact more

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.510 
presence and they let him interact more
with<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.530> ferrell<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> there

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
with will ferrell and they're just there

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
with will ferrell and they're just there
you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> play<00:01:51.689> off<00:01:51.840> each

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
you know just kind of play off each

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.060 
you know just kind of play off each
other<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.950> been<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
other more I think it would have been a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
other more I think it would have been a
lot<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.280> funny<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> end<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.659> not

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
lot more funny with in the end it's not

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
lot more funny with in the end it's not
it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> solid<00:01:56.180> performance<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.270> Will

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's a solid performance from Will

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's a solid performance from Will
Ferrell<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> mean<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> could<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.110> gotten

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
Ferrell I mean you could have gotten

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
Ferrell I mean you could have gotten
more<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.799> him<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> guess<00:01:59.579> maybe

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
more from him if you get I guess maybe

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.010 
more from him if you get I guess maybe

mind them putting him in the movie but

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
mind them putting him in the movie but
again<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.710> movie<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.520> cliche<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
again the movie is so just cliche and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.060 
again the movie is so just cliche and
just<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.810> goes<00:02:17.110> through<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> motions<00:02:17.680> and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
just like goes through the motions and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.440 
just like goes through the motions and
there's<00:02:18.460> laughs<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:18.970> movie<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:19.330> they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
there's laughs in the movie but they

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.370 
there's laughs in the movie but they
never<00:02:19.540> gives<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.960> point<00:02:20.200> where<00:02:20.290> you're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
never gives you the point where you're

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.690 
never gives you the point where you're
crying<00:02:20.650> your<00:02:20.800> seat<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.070> hold<00:02:21.340> onto<00:02:21.550> your

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
crying your seat or hold onto your

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.860 
crying your seat or hold onto your
stomach<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.300> few<00:02:22.480> good<00:02:22.630> laughs

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
stomach it's just a few good laughs

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.020 
stomach it's just a few good laughs
probably<00:02:23.320> not<00:02:23.709> worth<00:02:24.070> paying<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.640> price<00:02:24.820> of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
probably not worth paying the price of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.400 
probably not worth paying the price of
admission<00:02:25.060> for<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> ticket<00:02:25.990> if<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.320> an

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
admission for a ticket if you have an

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.660 
admission for a ticket if you have an
expensive<00:02:26.770> theater<00:02:27.010> nearby<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.550> where

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
expensive theater nearby but it's where
