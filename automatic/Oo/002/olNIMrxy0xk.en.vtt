00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello everyone with you revolverlab.com me 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 name is Nikita and it seems to me that we 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.179
 long time there was no knowledge base let's 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 fill this gap you are interested 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.780
 learn something new 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.210
 for example, what is characteristic of branded 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.150
 apple lightning ii connectors thunderbolt 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.859
 join go cool app 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 from aviasales.ru 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.660
 swing and fly lightning connector 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 to charge and transfer data to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 mobile devices apple company 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 was introduced in 2012 along with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.200
 iphone 5 despite large streams 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 critics what this garbage will have to re 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
 buy all the accessories will be this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 did it wrong otherwise iphone 5 is not 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.300
 would be so thin 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 This connector only use transmission 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 digital signals and unlike 30 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.899
 pin connector it can be inserted 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.510
 by both sides in this matter he even 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 cooler than micro usb connector itself has 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 8 pin in the ninth serves itself 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.850
 metal connector base 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 so that it can be inserted any 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 side inward and there is a small chip 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.640
 which controls the redistribution 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 pins depending on which 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 The side you put in is the so-called 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.119
 dynamic pin switching by the way 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 This chip drank a lot of blood underground 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.450
 accessory manufacturers 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.549
 as fakes with ios lites 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 Thunderbolt did not work 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.140
 lightning strike lightning lightning 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.090
 thunderbolt lightning strike 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.189
 someone nehilo Schwartz but in this very 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 lightning is probably the creative director 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.689
 hardware interface formerly known as 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 light peak was developed jointly 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 intel and apple to connect 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.060
 computer peripherals with 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.829
 maximum data transfer rate 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.409
 up to 10 megabits per second using 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.509
 copper wire and up to 20 gigabits per 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.970
 second using fiber thunderbolt 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 combines interfaces write express and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.079
 displayport in one cable through this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 connector can connect up to 6 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.860
 peripherals by combining them into 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.470
 chain if not go into details 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 Thunderbolt is a very fast connector. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.149
 peripheral equipment with which it stands 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.250
 usually more expensive but it works faster in 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.290
 comments write what is useful 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 tell next time but know 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.039
 literally in the next releases I 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.520
 tell you how to increase your
