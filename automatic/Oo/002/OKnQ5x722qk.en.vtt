and more importantly getting it in focus

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.080 
and more importantly getting it in focus
can<00:00:14.840> be<00:00:14.959> surprisingly<00:00:15.709> difficult<00:00:16.090> especially

today<00:00:25.700> I'm<00:00:25.910> gonna<00:00:26.030> show<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.480> basics<00:00:26.630> of

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
today I'm gonna show you the basics of

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.590 
today I'm gonna show you the basics of
autofocus<00:00:27.890> using<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.310> 70d<00:00:28.940> but<00:00:29.180> most<00:00:29.420> of

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
autofocus using the 70d but most of

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.180 
autofocus using the 70d but most of
these<00:00:29.690> techniques<00:00:29.960> can<00:00:30.350> also<00:00:30.619> be<00:00:30.890> used<00:00:31.070> on

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
these techniques can also be used on

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.479 
these techniques can also be used on
other<00:00:31.369> EOS<00:00:31.730> cameras<00:00:32.770> so<00:00:33.770> there's<00:00:33.949> plenty<00:00:34.460> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.310 
I'm going to shoot a series of photos
and<00:01:07.579> I'll<00:01:07.729> need<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.000> camera<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.509> track<00:01:08.810> focus

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and I'll need the camera to track focus

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.859 
and I'll need the camera to track focus
between<00:01:09.530> shots<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.969> for<00:01:11.240> more<00:01:11.390> control<00:01:11.719> over

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869

between shots so for more control over
focus<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:12.710> want<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.219> be<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.430> one<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.579> the

also<00:01:17.060> need<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.539> move<00:01:17.659> from<00:01:17.840> one<00:01:18.109> shot<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.409> AI

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
also need to move from one shot to AI

I want Lena and James to be in a
specific<00:01:25.100> part<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.850> my<00:01:26.000> frame<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:26.689> I'll<00:01:26.810> switch

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
specific part of my frame so I'll switch

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.200 
specific part of my frame so I'll switch
to<00:01:27.109> zone<00:01:27.560> AF<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.340> select<00:01:28.640> an<00:01:28.789> area<00:01:28.939> that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
to zone AF and select an area that

covers them with fewer AF points for the
camera<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.670> choose<00:01:31.909> from<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.719> will<00:01:32.869> help

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
camera to choose from this will help

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.990 
camera to choose from this will help
ensure<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.380> Nina<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:33.829> James<00:01:34.189> are<00:01:34.429> in<00:01:34.759> focus

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
ensure that Nina and James are in focus

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.819 
ensure that Nina and James are in focus
and<00:01:35.420> prevents<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.140> camera<00:01:36.439> from<00:01:36.590> being

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
and prevents the camera from being

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.529 
and prevents the camera from being
distracted<00:01:37.549> by<00:01:37.670> other<00:01:37.850> elements<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.509> the

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
distracted by other elements in the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.929 
distracted by other elements in the
frame<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.170> could<00:01:40.100> even<00:01:40.399> track<00:01:40.609> them<00:01:40.759> with<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
frame I could even track them with a

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.910 
frame I could even track them with a
single<00:01:41.359> point<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.200> takes<00:01:42.409> more<00:01:42.649> skill

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
single point but that takes more skill

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.620 
single point but that takes more skill
so<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:43.549> better<00:01:43.700> for<00:01:43.939> portraits<00:01:44.420> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so it's better for portraits and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:55.440 
so it's better for portraits and
stationary<00:01:45.259> subjects

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.880 

so<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.630> can<00:01:56.720> see<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.350> master<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
so as you can see if you can master the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.550 
so as you can see if you can master the
AI<00:01:58.070> server<00:01:58.730> which<00:01:58.910> tracks<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.600> focus<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
AI server which tracks the focus and the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.260 
AI server which tracks the focus and the
continuous<00:02:01.100> shooting<00:02:01.130> you've<00:02:01.850> really<00:02:02.150> got

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
continuous shooting you've really got

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.919 
continuous shooting you've really got
potential<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:02.930> some<00:02:03.080> cracking<00:02:03.710> action<00:02:04.130> shots

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.029 

there's<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> huge<00:02:10.289> amount<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.710> do<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there's a huge amount you can do to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
there's a huge amount you can do to
optimize<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.790> AF<00:02:12.060> settings<00:02:12.450> within<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
optimize the AF settings within the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.990 
optimize the AF settings within the
custom<00:02:13.200> functional<00:02:13.650> menu<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
custom functional menu but one of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.850 
custom functional menu but one of the
really<00:02:15.360> useful<00:02:15.540> abilities<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.380> camera<00:02:16.710> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
really useful abilities of the camera is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.590 
really useful abilities of the camera is
to<00:02:16.890> automatically<00:02:17.880> select<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.300> AF<00:02:18.570> point

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
to automatically select the AF point

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.270 
to automatically select the AF point
depending<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:19.770> way<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.220> are

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
depending on which way that we are

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.230 
depending on which way that we are
holding<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> set<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.310> custom<00:02:23.820> function

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
holding it so I set this custom function

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.110 
holding it so I set this custom function
to<00:02:24.390> different<00:02:24.780> AF<00:02:25.140> points<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.790> select

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
to different AF points and then select

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.610 
to different AF points and then select
these<00:02:27.360> points<00:02:27.810> when<00:02:27.990> I'm<00:02:28.140> holding<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> camera

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
these points when I'm holding the camera

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
these points when I'm holding the camera
in<00:02:28.920> landscape<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:31.490> these<00:02:32.490> when<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.060> holding

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
in landscape and these when I'm holding

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.670 
in landscape and these when I'm holding
the<00:02:33.510> camera<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:34.050> portrait<00:02:36.050> now<00:02:37.050> I'm<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the camera in portrait now I'm going to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.770 
the camera in portrait now I'm going to
shoot<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.040> range<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.610> shots<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.180> both<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.630> them

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
shoot a range of shots of both of them

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.510 
shoot a range of shots of both of them
on<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.990> zip<00:02:40.260> wire<00:02:40.440> flipping<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> camera

on a zip wire flipping the camera

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.729 
on a zip wire flipping the camera
between<00:02:41.670> portrait<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.480> landscape<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.320> all<00:02:43.709> I

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
between portrait and landscape and all I

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.440 
between portrait and landscape and all I
need<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.190> think<00:02:44.370> about<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.820> catching<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
need to think about is catching the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:57.199 
need to think about is catching the
moment<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.380> time<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.940> shoot<00:02:56.940> them<00:02:57.060> down

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
moment now it's time to shoot them down

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.440 
moment now it's time to shoot them down
there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.300 

I<00:03:02.900> went<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> photograph<00:03:04.379> Lena<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.830> James<00:03:05.069> as

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I went to photograph Lena and James as

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
I went to photograph Lena and James as
they<00:03:05.640> come<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.120> land<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:06.810> they're<00:03:06.989> gonna<00:03:07.080> be

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
they come into land but they're gonna be

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.350 
they come into land but they're gonna be
moving<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.860> quickly<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> need<00:03:09.269> the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
moving really quickly so I need the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.880 
moving really quickly so I need the
camera<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> pick<00:03:10.080> them<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:10.620> into

19 points lick at the moment it's set to
center<00:03:20.760> point<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.269> they'll<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.660> coming<00:03:21.959> in

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
center point but they'll be coming in

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.900 
center point but they'll be coming in
from<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.440> right<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.040> I'll<00:03:23.160> select<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.670> this

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
from the right so I'll select it to this

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.050 
from the right so I'll select it to this
point<00:03:24.150> here<00:03:25.549> here<00:03:26.549> they<00:03:26.670> come

point here here they come
I'm<00:03:27.140> placing<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.410> selected<00:03:28.860> start<00:03:29.130> point

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I'm placing the selected start point

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.369 
I'm placing the selected start point
over<00:03:29.670> James<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.269> half<00:03:30.599> pressing<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> shutter

over James and half pressing the shutter

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.650 
over James and half pressing the shutter
the<00:03:31.709> camera<00:03:32.400> tracked<00:03:32.760> him<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.180> he<00:03:33.269> traveled

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the camera tracked him as he traveled

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.720 
the camera tracked him as he traveled
across<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.959> frame

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.160 

so<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.030> time<00:03:43.209> around<00:03:43.359> so<00:03:43.629> we're<00:03:43.810> going<00:03:44.049> down

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
so this time around so we're going down

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.149 
so this time around so we're going down
the<00:03:44.230> zip<00:03:44.260> why<00:03:44.499> but<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:44.739> gonna<00:03:44.829> be<00:03:44.980> from

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
the zip why but I'm gonna be from

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.539 
the zip why but I'm gonna be from
videoing<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.879> not<00:03:46.090> taking<00:03:46.450> photographs<00:03:50.549> in

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
videoing and not taking photographs in

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.550 
videoing and not taking photographs in
video<00:03:51.939> mode<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.659> make<00:03:52.840> use<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.319> face

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
video mode I can make use of the face

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.709 
video mode I can make use of the face
tracking<00:03:53.920> function<00:03:54.519> which<00:03:54.730> finds<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.389> tracks

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
tracking function which finds and tracks

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.080 
tracking function which finds and tracks
any<00:03:56.049> face<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> frame<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.250> allows<00:03:57.639> me<00:03:57.909> to

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
any face in the frame and allows me to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.599 
any face in the frame and allows me to
smoothly<00:03:58.450> pull<00:03:58.930> focus<00:03:59.200> between<00:03:59.709> subjects

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
smoothly pull focus between subjects

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.000 
smoothly pull focus between subjects
this<00:04:01.599> time<00:04:01.780> around<00:04:01.959> I've<00:04:02.109> changed<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> angle

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
this time around I've changed the angle

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.990 
this time around I've changed the angle
but<00:04:03.099> it's<00:04:03.219> gonna<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.489> real<00:04:03.609> challenge<00:04:03.639> for

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
but it's gonna be a real challenge for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.449 
but it's gonna be a real challenge for
the<00:04:04.150> AI<00:04:04.329> server<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.200> Nina<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.919> James<00:04:06.189> are

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
the AI server because Nina and James are

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:20.550 
the AI server because Nina and James are
literally<00:04:06.969> coming<00:04:07.180> straight<00:04:07.989> at<00:04:08.049> me

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.770 

it's<00:04:21.160> actually<00:04:21.639> incredibly<00:04:22.270> handy<00:04:22.570> but<00:04:22.720> you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
it's actually incredibly handy but you
