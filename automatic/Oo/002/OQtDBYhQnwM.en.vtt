down here this first set through here

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.870 
down here this first set through here
will<00:03:01.230> determine<00:03:01.530> how<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> actual<00:03:02.490> curvature

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
will determine how the actual curvature

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.520 
will determine how the actual curvature
of<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.600> bridge<00:03:03.840> will<00:03:04.050> actually<00:03:04.350> be

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
of your bridge will actually be

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.410 
of your bridge will actually be
determined<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.030> various

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
determined so you have a various

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.699 
determined so you have a various
settings<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.200> actually<00:03:07.320> change

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
settings that you can actually change

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.250 
settings that you can actually change
and<00:03:08.100> I'll<00:03:08.220> update<00:03:08.760> how<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.150> actual<00:03:09.780> bridge<00:03:10.020> is

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and I'll update how the actual bridge is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
and I'll update how the actual bridge is
applied<00:03:10.560> between<00:03:10.800> those<00:03:11.130> two<00:03:11.310> Poly's<00:03:11.700> down

can adjust the actual curvature of your

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
can adjust the actual curvature of your
model<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.100> actually<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.550> specified<00:03:18.239> so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
model and actually have it specified so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.660 
model and actually have it specified so
it's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.900> specific<00:03:19.560> curvature<00:03:19.769> rather<00:03:20.250> than<00:03:20.550> an

it's a specific curvature rather than an
interactive<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> also<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> same

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
interactive one you can also do the same

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.380 
interactive one you can also do the same
thing<00:03:23.100> with<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> resolution<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.300> have

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
thing with the resolution so if you have

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060 
thing with the resolution so if you have
a<00:03:24.450> specific<00:03:24.660> resolution<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:25.830> that

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
a specific resolution you want that

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.190 
a specific resolution you want that
bridge<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.400> be<00:03:26.640> applied<00:03:26.940> with<00:03:27.269> just<00:03:27.810> come<00:03:27.959> down

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
bridge to be applied with just come down

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.630 
bridge to be applied with just come down
here<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.560> either<00:03:28.769> change<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> slider<00:03:29.430> or

here and either change the slider or
just<00:03:29.820> type<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.540> now<00:03:31.019> when<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.410> back

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
just type it in and now when you go back

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.259 
just type it in and now when you go back
to<00:03:31.980> your<00:03:32.100> model<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.519> bridge<00:03:33.000> those<00:03:33.239> two

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
to your model and bridge those two

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.630 
to your model and bridge those two
Poly's<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.200> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.590> give<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.100> actual

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
Poly's it's going to give you the actual

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.080 
Poly's it's going to give you the actual
specific<00:03:36.180> resolution<00:03:36.750> along<00:03:37.110> those<00:03:37.350> areas

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
specific resolution along those areas

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.910 
specific resolution along those areas
you<00:03:39.090> also<00:03:39.269> have<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.690> ability<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.110> align<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.800> a

tangent or a normal based on how you
want<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.530> bridge<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> be<00:03:43.920> created<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.640> can

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
want that bridge to be created you can

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.250 
want that bridge to be created you can
adjust<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.269> width<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.930> make<00:03:46.170> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
adjust the width you can make it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.350 
adjust the width you can make it
symmetrical<00:03:46.769> or<00:03:46.950> non<00:03:47.130> symmetrical<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
symmetrical or non symmetrical and you

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.300 
symmetrical or non symmetrical and you
can<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:48.660> adjust<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.260> poly<00:03:49.650> grouping<00:03:50.130> in

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
can also adjust the poly grouping in

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.750 
can also adjust the poly grouping in
rows<00:03:50.790> or<00:03:51.090> flat<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.170> right<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:52.920> set<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.489> rows

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
rows or flat so right now as set to rows

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.400 
rows or flat so right now as set to rows
you're<00:03:54.030> gonna<00:03:54.209> get<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> offset<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.200> poly

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
you're gonna get a offset of poly

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.350 
you're gonna get a offset of poly
grouping<00:03:55.739> along<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> edges<00:03:56.489> if<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.030> come<00:03:57.239> back

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
grouping along the edges if I come back

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.270 
grouping along the edges if I come back
in<00:03:57.540> here<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.750> change<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.500> flat<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.010> now

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
in here and change this to flat and now

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.949 
in here and change this to flat and now
bridge<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.940> Poly's<00:04:00.300> you're<00:04:00.630> gonna<00:04:00.720> notice

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
bridge to Poly's you're gonna notice

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.570 
bridge to Poly's you're gonna notice
that<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.410> poly<00:04:01.590> grouping<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.070> constant

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
that the poly grouping is constant

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.330 
that the poly grouping is constant
across<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.180> entire<00:04:03.450> bridge<00:04:03.890> other<00:04:04.890> options

across the entire bridge other options

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.009 
across the entire bridge other options
down<00:04:05.489> here<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.850> will<00:04:06.090> determine<00:04:06.269> if<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.780> want

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
down here you will determine if you want

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.840 
down here you will determine if you want
triangles<00:04:07.620> or<00:04:07.769> quads<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.340> generated

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
triangles or quads to be generated

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.300 
triangles or quads to be generated
through<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.209> bridge<00:04:09.680> another<00:04:10.680> neat<00:04:11.280> thing

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
through the bridge another neat thing

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.920 
through the bridge another neat thing
about<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.390> bridge<00:04:12.570> will<00:04:12.780> not

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
about this is that the bridge will not

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.960 
about this is that the bridge will not
only<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.590> generate<00:04:14.070> interesting<00:04:14.730> shapes

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
only just generate interesting shapes

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.759 
only just generate interesting shapes
like<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.570> are<00:04:15.600> round<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> come

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
like this that are round but if you come

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.949 
like this that are round but if you come
across<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.400> mesh<00:04:17.609> here<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.090> say<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.330> just<00:04:18.660> queue

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
across a mesh here and say I just queue

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.140 
across a mesh here and say I just queue
mesh<00:04:19.200> these<00:04:19.560> two<00:04:19.830> polygons<00:04:20.340> out<00:04:20.519> quick<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
mesh these two polygons out quick and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.210 
mesh these two polygons out quick and
now<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.020> bridge<00:04:22.229> these<00:04:22.560> two<00:04:22.620> Poly's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
now I want to bridge these two Poly's

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.730 
now I want to bridge these two Poly's
I'll<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> different<00:04:24.150> result<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:25.440> coming

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
I'll get a different result so coming

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.500 
I'll get a different result so coming
back<00:04:25.770> up<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.280> bridge<00:04:26.460> option<00:04:26.820> there<00:04:26.970> and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
back up to the bridge option there and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.780
