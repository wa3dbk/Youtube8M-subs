00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hello to you website and soul finder 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.679
 Rare guest at the studio today 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.669
 I often read questions on the site in 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:27.039
 group crisis and 22 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.980
 group VKontakte letters even written 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.599
 why do you spend so little time 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.649
 the story of sneakers 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.820
 adidas well i have today's presentation 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 would like to devote not so much model 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 crisis shadow 2 how much in principle 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.969
 modern 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.920
 adidas so let's say we tell on 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.219
 periodic about classics some if 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.929
 she appears and sneakerheads share but 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:03.150
 new items while I talk about the beauty of the course and 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.560
 all the seams themselves understand we see that 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.980
 model 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 performed based on the sprint both of you 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.670
 I do not see the mark now but I see it 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.040
 also black on black written on 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.340
 black adverb 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.970
 sprint legs smelled it first is 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.920
 It was now painted 3 sold well in 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:33.210
 principle their evolution is not that strong 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 and jarred on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.030
 this is for smooth material 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.210
 about two sheets of paper 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 which is designed to maximize 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.640
 weight loss 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.700
 that's why now adidas hunt 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.229
 Of course I'm really sorry Derrick Rose 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.770
 because 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.850
 get hurt after injury 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.439
 it's terrible but I certainly hope so 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.259
 that this will be his last injury in 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.979
 career but there is also surprising 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.690
 there is nothing such speeds at what he 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.319
 moves the joints of a person in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.690
 principle can not stand that is he 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.420
 developing and a joint 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.549
 titanium it is time to put then they will 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.920
 as much from women as you are fast 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.799
 this is my purely individual opinion 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.690
 who can not listen and company 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.690
 adidas continues to bend its line and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.790
 There should be light Andrew shoes 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.630
 ring of course speak the most flowers 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.349
 the best sneakers on earth but 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.060
 sorry andrew 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.310
 this is something i have never in my life 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.079
 I agree you just have to gas 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.410
 specific it does not mean that she 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:54.099
 bad adidas company promotes three 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.099
 reebok strips that they restored 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.440
 started to make him happy now on my 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.280
 look gives more exhaust and more 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.639
 interest from sneakerheads 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.190
 with no collectors and so forth therefore 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.590
 they are now releasing a cube i weeks he and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.900
 if not surprised were the relay ware 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.230
 will appear in huge numbers now and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.840
 will start with a poison star but because 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.030
 completely different , that's what it was then 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.250
 a completely different need to go further ahead 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.099
 now we are completely 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.349
 discuss the sneaker 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:35.489
 material you see yes 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.870
 He basically here due to bending 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.799
 due to the bending angle it is practically 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.760
 hard can be considered 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.920
 but in principle it is a paper component 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.349
 round shoelaces rather symbolic 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.510
 because the width of the sneaker is very 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.849
 low and he sits on his foot by himself 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.349
 three strips adidas plastic retainer 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:10.030
 in the heel area it ends now 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:12.209
 I will show about here like new 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.150
 here ends the plastic retainer and 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.359
 we can be sure that it is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.459
 the only thing holding back leg 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.400
 basketball player that's plastic 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.340
 little thing she's kinda relatively 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.900
 relatively stable of course 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.889
 a certain ledge but not as noticeable as on 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.699
 sneakers nike jordan 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:42.190
 and so on now I will show here approximately 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.500
 at the level of the gray part at the gray level 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.050
 parts insole 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.919
 that is, the player is at that thickness 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 must have a feeling card while doing well 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.320
 there you can go to the grandmother to leave 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.409
 to desire a better sole area 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.970
 there is not a coach this is a good sole 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.659
 resembles nothing despite what the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.940
 creators here crater super found creator 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:12.690
 from 6 5 7 years old foam is very 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.680
 soft on makes 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.320
 a certain area on a pyatkin then 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.820
 there is practically all gray material 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.240
 he goes underlay it just at the slave 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.970
 gum gives a good grip I'm so on 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.640
 first glance feeling and most importantly not 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.380
 brandy which means schoolchildren can wear 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.880
 wear them in gym class I 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.490
 upset 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.910
 2 sneakers is still adidas on them 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.590
 I donâ€™t have to spend much time now 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:53.460
 will show you the most important thing here so 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.370
 It looks inside the shoe that is, he would 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.060
 didn't hurt that 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:07.310
 flywire threads they add 3 grams like 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:09.870
 sneaker gum locking tongue 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.520
 if not even a boot just gum 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.560
 last century plunge like this 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.280
 he's inside emptiness 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.050
 want to hug and cry friends when you 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.540
 ask why we don't tell in 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.800
 vidos well because most models 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.500
 well, about the same as there were five 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.560
 years ago we are telling crazylight a 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.570
 because it was a breakthrough we 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.930
 talk about old models because 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.640
 This is a classic of this part of the story. 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.320
 modern adidas models they are very 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.220
 specific it and friends not 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.980
 anti-advertising 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.780
 and not purely individual opinion is 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.030
 simply 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.500
 third-party remark and so we are with 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.420
 pleasure will talk about 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.020
 sneakers if they fall into our hands 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.170
 but hunt them to tell 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.210
 you and share while adidas not 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.850
 pushing this decision 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.110
 and with you was impartial serge and 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.430
 sites of fire 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.430
 to new meetings
