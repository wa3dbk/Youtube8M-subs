00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.200
 because then bread and there you too 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.930
 Potatoes are left over for the last 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.150
 dinner I have decided 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.920
 that only a Swabian potato bread 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.700
 after or too high German 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.820
 a Swabian potato bread of 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.650
 module wanted to lose than ever 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.580
 first time to meet by the one 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.519
 So of course need no potatoes 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.769
 The potatoes are cut into coarse pieces 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:48.100
 have cut 250 g then you need 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:52.960
 140 grams of tender oatmeal 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.140
 we need 350 grams of spelled flour type 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.539
 630 he half teaspoon sugar one 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:07.780
 teaspoon salt then need 240 times 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.780
 gram of water and natural cube yeast 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.619
 First, make the potatoes small 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.299
 do 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 small chop course was smaller 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.430
 four seconds to level four 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.140
 there come legally to contribute 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.610
 when the potatoes do not look so 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 as a really nice small then comes 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.140
 next the girl too 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.120
 the hair is flaking 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.580
 a teaspoon of salt 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:22.880
 Half a teaspoon of sugar yeast 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:44.930
 and the water you read all now 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 Of course, upright and two minutes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:56.210
 and let's go and I'll finish the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:08.810
 Kneading does not look nice 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:08.810
 We'll get that out of here now 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.579
 as you can see on the eschen on first 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.510
 black nothing at all in the pot 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.510
 the more already existing 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.700
 practiced and still can get it 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.709
 not right 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.970
 My husband did not want that either 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.260
 is and is awesome but it became him 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:05.099
 eklat just said we also miss it okay 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:07.079
 I find that in the opinion of one 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.419
 bun I 'm not that yet 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.639
 it had acquired a stop again 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:15.199
 glass bowl come then clean 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.699
 cloth that would have been very strong 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:25.979
 so that the dough does not hang in there 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:30.210
 stays and then the dough balls come in 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.820
 conclusion down down there may now 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.139
 I have to go so forty-five minutes 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.750
 for up to an hour 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.750
 and then we'll leave soon 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 oh yes almost my own I will today 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.030
 the bread again on my stone 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.460
 button 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.910
 I'll be on ice for now 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.560
 250 degrees 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.139
 then you have to go down to the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.350
 actual baking temperature of 200 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.700
 he is just so red again 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.680
 has gone up 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.930
 the I'm now in a preheated 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:15.320
 oven and baking since 50 to 50 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:22.990
 minutes up to an hour finished 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:24.590
 I got the bread out just fine 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.960
 finish 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.270
 Let's cool that down and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.840

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.840
