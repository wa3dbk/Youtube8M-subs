00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.520
 Greetings! Welcome to our smanos video channel. 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.950
 In this video, we will introduce the S105 Plug &amp; Play alarm panel. 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.410
 Its use is easy and can be set within a minute. 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.380
 It operates at a security frequency of 868 MHz 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 and can be extended to up to 40 sensors. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.120
 Let's see what the S105 alarm system kit contains. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.700
 The set includes a mini siren with SS1005 strobe 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.200
 motion sensor PIR with bracket and screw set 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.160
 door / window contact, two remote controls 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.740
 double-sided adhesive tape, documentation and warning stickers. 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.300
 How the alarm system works. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 Normal operation of this system is very easy. 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.499
 If the sensor has been activated, the signal is sent to the dashboard. 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.800
 The control panel instantly recognizes an integrated siren. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.380
 All products in this kit can be used as accessories for various smanos control panels. 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.940
 To install the system, simply plug the siren into an electrical outlet. 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.840
 To check that previously paired accessories are paired correctly 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.500
 press the siren button for about half a second. Siren beeps once 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.409
 and switches to pairing mode. After activating the sensor and sending a signal 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.449
 the siren receives the signal and connects. 

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.700
 If you hear one beep, this is a new connection. 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 If you hear two beeps, it means the siren has been paired earlier. 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550
 Let's look at the door / window contact. 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.840
 First pull out the tape sensor. Verify that the door / window contact triangles are facing each other. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.380
 Now separate the magnet from the sensor and the red LED on the sensor will light up. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 This means it has been activated. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.100
 It can be installed next to a door or window opening. 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.340
 Place the sensor on the side. Place the magnet on a door or window. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.960
 Check that the triangles are facing each other and keep a distance of one centimeter. 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.350
 A PIR motion sensor follows. 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.410
 First pull the tape out of the motion sensor. 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.600
 The test runs for about 30 seconds. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.780
 If the sensor detects movement twice within three minutes, 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.320
 switches to power saving mode. 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.340
 This means that it will not activate and will not send a signal to the dashboard. 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.980
 Press the button on the back of the motion sensor twice to send a pairing signal to the device. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.300
 The best installation height is 2.2 meters. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.720
 This gives you a range of about 8 meters and an angle of view of 110 degrees. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.740
 Each product in this kit can be used as an accessory for all smanos panels. 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.420
 The PIR motion sensor and magnetic contact can be installed in normal pairing mode 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.480
 To install the SS1005 siren on the smanos dashboard, the siren must be in pairing mode. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.280
 Press the siren button for about half a second until you hear a beep. 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 Then press the activation button on the smanos dashboard. 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020
 The siren beeps once, which means it is connected. 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.520
 And so our video about this product ends. We hope you enjoyed it
