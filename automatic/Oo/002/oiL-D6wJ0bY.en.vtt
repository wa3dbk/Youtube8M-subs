and it is a wonderful piece I wish I'd
had<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.950> long<00:02:30.130> ago<00:02:30.370> let's<00:02:30.670> look<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:31.000> here

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
had this long ago let's look up here

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.680 
had this long ago let's look up here
this<00:02:32.080> whole<00:02:32.320> frame<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:33.190> connected<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:34.180> two<00:02:34.510> by

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
this whole frame is connected of two by

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.479 
this whole frame is connected of two by
twos<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.769> see<00:02:36.010> how<00:02:36.190> they<00:02:36.459> are

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
twos and you can see how they are

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.550 
twos and you can see how they are
connected<00:02:36.670> here<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.989> mortise<00:02:38.470> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
connected here with this mortise and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
connected here with this mortise and
tenon<00:02:38.920> joint<00:02:39.130> here<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.610> stretcher<00:02:40.209> down

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
tenon joint here is that stretcher down

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.420 
tenon joint here is that stretcher down
at<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.989> bottom<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.620> comes<00:02:41.920> through<00:02:42.220> here

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
at the bottom and it comes through here

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.940 
at the bottom and it comes through here
this<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> vertical<00:02:43.600> style<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.500> here's<00:02:44.799> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
this is the vertical style and here's a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.370 
this is the vertical style and here's a
rail<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.000> frame<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:47.019> that's<00:02:47.200> what<00:02:47.320> we

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
rail for the frame so that's what we

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.060 
rail for the frame so that's what we
need<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.799> make<00:02:48.040> these<00:02:48.519> frames<00:02:49.450> here<00:02:50.260> see

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
need to do is make these frames here see

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.850 
need to do is make these frames here see
these<00:02:51.220> two<00:02:51.519> frames<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.330> they<00:02:53.050> just<00:02:53.290> hinge<00:02:53.590> on

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
these two frames and they just hinge on

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.320 
these two frames and they just hinge on
now<00:02:54.130> I've<00:02:54.220> got<00:02:54.400> one<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.989> come

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
now I've got one we come

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.820 
now I've got one we come
round<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:56.810> well<00:02:57.080> let's<00:02:57.320> see<00:02:57.440> i<00:02:57.470> guess<00:02:57.710> i

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
round on this well let's see i guess i

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.820 
round on this well let's see i guess i
can<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.750> I've<00:02:59.750> got<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.530> that's

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
can do it like this I've got one that's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.860 
can do it like this I've got one that's
gonna<00:03:00.980> be<00:03:01.250> braced<00:03:01.640> here<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.210> can<00:03:02.360> see<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.630> put

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
gonna be braced here you can see it put

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.310 
gonna be braced here you can see it put
the<00:03:02.900> lag<00:03:03.740> bolts<00:03:04.220> through<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.750> we're<00:03:06.140> going<00:03:06.260> to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
the lag bolts through and we're going to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.520 
the lag bolts through and we're going to
see<00:03:06.440> something<00:03:06.650> about<00:03:06.890> these<00:03:07.070> screws<00:03:07.460> to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
see something about these screws to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.510 
see something about these screws to
looking<00:03:09.530> at<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.860> say<00:03:09.980> boy<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:10.340> have

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
looking at this and say boy do they have

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.910 
looking at this and say boy do they have
those<00:03:10.670> back<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.210> will<00:03:11.450> they<00:03:12.170> say<00:03:12.380> back<00:03:12.590> when

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
those back then will they say back when

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.410 
those back then will they say back when
i'm<00:03:13.790> using<00:03:14.330> right<00:03:14.360> now<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.960> carriage<00:03:15.530> bolt

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
i'm using right now a carriage bolt

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.660 
i'm using right now a carriage bolt
alright<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.660> carriage<00:03:18.110> bolt<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.830> brace

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
alright it's a carriage bolt to brace

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.810 
alright it's a carriage bolt to brace
this<00:03:19.940> long<00:03:20.570> diagonal<00:03:20.870> bracing<00:03:21.770> here<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.160> what

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
this long diagonal bracing here and what

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.100 
this long diagonal bracing here and what
do<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:22.970> think<00:03:23.210> you<00:03:23.390> are<00:03:23.420> bolted<00:03:23.990> together

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
do you think you are bolted together

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.000 
do you think you are bolted together
with<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> carriage<00:03:25.010> bolt<00:03:25.600> hmm<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> carrot

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
with a carriage bolt hmm like a carrot

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.920 
with a carriage bolt hmm like a carrot
okay<00:03:28.520> so<00:03:29.300> this<00:03:29.960> is<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> very<00:03:30.860> old<00:03:31.480> technology<00:03:32.480> I

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
okay so this is a very old technology I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.720 
okay so this is a very old technology I
think<00:03:33.080> what<00:03:33.410> really<00:03:33.560> happens<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.220> they<00:03:34.340> become

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
think what really happens is they become

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.420 
think what really happens is they become
cheaper<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.810> cheaper<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.340> it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
cheaper and cheaper so you can see it

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.520 
cheaper and cheaper so you can see it
need<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.640> do<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> little<00:03:37.850> bit<00:03:38.060> better<00:03:38.350> job<00:03:39.350> of

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
need to do a little bit better job of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.140 
need to do a little bit better job of
fitting<00:03:39.740> those<00:03:39.980> together<00:03:40.160> i'm<00:03:40.730> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> move

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
fitting those together i'm going to move

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.570 
fitting those together i'm going to move
up<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.570> middle<00:03:41.870> here<00:03:42.310> alright<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.430> there's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
up to the middle here alright so there's

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.640 
up to the middle here alright so there's
one<00:03:43.820> brace<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.390> place<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.959> can<00:03:45.320> see<00:03:45.470> what<00:03:45.590> it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
one brace in place you can see what it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.650 
one brace in place you can see what it
attaches<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.190> another<00:03:46.700> two<00:03:46.970> by<00:03:47.120> two<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.600> is

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
attaches to another two by two this is

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.080 
attaches to another two by two this is
an<00:03:47.930> o<00:03:48.110> an<00:03:48.500> ocean<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.630> two<00:03:50.630> by<00:03:50.840> twos<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:52.090> just

an o an ocean of two by twos and just

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.320 
an o an ocean of two by twos and just
screw<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.720> together<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:55.030> again<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.180> one

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
screw that together and again that one

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.520 
screw that together and again that one
needs<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.660> third<00:03:58.300> carriage<00:03:59.300> bolt<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.750> wing<00:04:00.470> nut

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
needs a third carriage bolt and wing nut

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.320 
needs a third carriage bolt and wing nut
on<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.980> end<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.400> brace<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.820> only<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.150> one

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
on the end of this brace I only have one

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.710 
on the end of this brace I only have one
of<00:04:02.450> them<00:04:02.570> fixed<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.769> now<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.570> go<00:04:05.570> ahead

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
two by twos and a 2 by 10 work surface

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.390 
two by twos and a 2 by 10 work surface
is<00:04:22.100> very<00:04:22.900> very<00:04:23.900> solid<00:04:24.620> all<00:04:24.800> right<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.310> got

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
is very very solid all right so you got

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.460 
is very very solid all right so you got
solid<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.000> bracing<00:04:26.480> not<00:04:26.660> only<00:04:26.840> stiffens<00:04:27.320> it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
solid that bracing not only stiffens it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.400 
solid that bracing not only stiffens it
this<00:04:27.650> way<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.340> also<00:04:28.570> supports<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:30.169> low<00:04:30.350> to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
same way you do a blacksmith's anvil you

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.260 
same way you do a blacksmith's anvil you
want<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.550> get<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.729> height<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:58.910> an<00:04:59.090> anvil
