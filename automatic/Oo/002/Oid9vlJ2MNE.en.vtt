 Well, the winning season continues to all 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.289
 the teams already had words about what they were 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.340
 Reached absolute obse under the terms of the season 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.340
 to the semi-finals and let them succeed 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.399

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.979
 the ballet itself is all for this moment 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.759
 so critical that 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.349
 requires special stress in the other 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.810
 hand strain 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.330
 when outside the ballet window and good weather all 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.990
 have a rest 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.880
 in general, it is not particularly logical therefore 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.150
 aligning the controversial 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.970
