00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 bourguignon 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.769
 for that we will need 1 liter 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.219
 and therefore it becomes bottles 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.790
 Red wine 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.870
 then we will need some oil 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.150
 agrees need the element 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.529
 main kilograms of meat from 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 beef of 5 paris mushrooms 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.740
 will cut into thin slices of 100 g of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.420
 smoked bacon from the rooms and 2 cloves 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 garlic so know couples 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 previously of two onions achir and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.610
 also about fifteen green olives 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.290
 pitted and so for cooking 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.180
 the beautiful Burgundy and we are 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.250
 have to a pressure cooker of this type of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.410
 first step we pour a few cities 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.410
 at the point of our self-cooking 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 slightly so that the fund is useful 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.420
 and we could be proud of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 my draw I throw a little bit of onions 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 in for the year that starts at 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 shudder 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 I can immediately to that of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.460
 yellow in two in the world can the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460
 to come 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.840
 it's good to say a few minutes in 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.830
 restless 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.990
 behind we will start to drop the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.210
 pieces of meat 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.250
 little by little 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.610
 deep of our 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.610
 that's all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060
 how to train in the game 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.840
 and the leg a logo the onion directly 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.990
 Here we go slowly meat 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 in the dish and mix in a few 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.930
 so onions the big 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 the government continues so here is a 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.830
 time you have the entrance so any 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.270
 the meat in the dish you could see 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.530
 in you understood that it's for 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 to give the onion taste to the meat 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.179
 and especially to grab our coins 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.160
 beef 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.410
 so now we will be able to incorporate 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.410
 so both garlic cloves 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.610
 here for slices then it was 100 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.620
 g smoked bacon 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 so we had salons we'll see 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.160
 then we can pour some into our 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.270
 fifteenth green olive to finish 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.210
 the mushrooms of paris 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.720
 slice not too much film not 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.720
 too much place 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.840
 do not need mushrooms 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.370
 then collapses and then disappear 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.620
 now that we have put all our 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 ingredients so we will be able to zinc or 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.400
 the wine so to cover all the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.400
 preparation 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.510
 his trouble in the gard 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760
 it is 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760
 second bottle 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.410
 cables 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.020
 so we add so 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.230
 a bouquet of thyme and a leaf of 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.230
 laurel 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.190
 a bit of that the hull 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.660
 a breakthrough of hall flowers 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.590
 of turn in pepper tower 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.060
 so now we have more than 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.850
 cover your auto cooker and 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.240
 peaks added the amptp really a 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.430
 we will simmer an hour so 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.070
 here after more than an hour in our 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.700
 auto cooker beef bourguignon should 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:09.200
 to be cooked so we will open it small 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.090
 advice before the last ten minutes 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.120
 you stop the fire all the ways 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.640
 it continues leather given the heat that has 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.820
 in the dish so now 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.400
 little trick so to finish 4 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.860
 tablespoons of sauce line for that 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.290
 get burned so go sprinkle on 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.790
 your preparation and you mix in 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.860
 some that yesterday the whole here is the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.850

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.850
 for the next day 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.530
 little preview of the finished product we just 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.600
 had warmed up a bit so that the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.350
 socialie do take then we will see 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.580
