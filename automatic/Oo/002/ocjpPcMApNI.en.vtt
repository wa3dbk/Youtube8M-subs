about an air hole that is on the side of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
about an air hole that is on the side of
the<00:00:56.850> pannarello<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> matter<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the pannarello on it's all a matter of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
the pannarello on it's all a matter of
what<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> inject<00:00:59.910> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the right amount of air but not too much

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
the right amount of air but not too much
so<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.579> first<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> froth<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.780> milk

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you get no froth you take it up and you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
you get no froth you take it up and you
actually<00:01:06.060> cover<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> air<00:01:06.689> hole<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
actually cover up the air hole and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080 
actually cover up the air hole and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
there's no longer second air and so it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.149 
there's no longer second air and so it's
not<00:01:09.150> frothing<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.049> heating<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
not frothing it's just heating so it's

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.469 
not frothing it's just heating so it's
all<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.400> timing<00:01:11.700> making<00:01:12.000> sure<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.360> know

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
all about timing making sure you know

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
all about timing making sure you know
when<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> come<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> air<00:01:13.260> hole<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.650> there's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
when they come to air hole up there's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.710 
when they come to air hole up there's
two<00:01:14.280> kinds<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> pannarello<00:01:15.210> Weiser<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.600> can

little better look at it right there
then<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.110> groove<00:01:28.380> cut<00:01:28.920> into

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
then there's a little groove cut into

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sucks air around this o-ring so as soon

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.210 
sucks air around this o-ring so as soon
as<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> milk<00:01:34.259> covers<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.770> it'll<00:01:35.040> stop

milk it won't cover the air hole soon
enough<00:02:23.250> maybe<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.760> might<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.090> too<00:02:24.240> much

air in the froth okay so you do want to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.940 
air in the froth okay so you do want to
be<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> little<00:02:26.580> bit<00:02:26.700> careful<00:02:26.820> about<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
that's in there I'll have a little

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.600 
that's in there I'll have a little
different<00:02:36.990> technique<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.560> feel<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.220> pitcher

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
different technique I feel this pitcher

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.690 
different technique I feel this pitcher
is<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> third<00:02:39.330> full<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.690> milk<00:02:40.220> put<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> tip<00:02:41.490> well

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
is a third full of milk put the tip well

Bowl the surface open the steam map and
it'll<00:02:44.940> start<00:02:45.180> frothing<00:02:45.800> Todd<00:02:46.800> how<00:02:46.980> hot<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it'll start frothing Todd how hot do you
