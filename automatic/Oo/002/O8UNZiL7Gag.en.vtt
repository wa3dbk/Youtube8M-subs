Kepler than famous astronomer and it was

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.250 
Kepler than famous astronomer and it was
actually<00:02:47.290> solved<00:02:47.950> some<00:02:48.130> 15<00:02:48.580> years<00:02:48.910> ago

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.990

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
this is tetrahedra equals space

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.020 
this is tetrahedra equals space
tetrahedra<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.590> there<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.040> gap<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.700> 5

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
tetrahedra so there is this gap so 5

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.750
