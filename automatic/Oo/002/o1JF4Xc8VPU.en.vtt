00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 everyone will have to think about to show you how 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.069
 do this new thing and that one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.670
 which is called do not even know how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.679
 call in general there today i will teach you how 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.020
 to make 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.520
 half blocks of any blocks at all 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.439
 here liza sat there and then talking to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.460
 all legs and we have volume 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:33.420
 everything is fine and here it is our mechanism 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.410
 hiding behind this here behind this building 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 so mud here he is our messing bottom 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 turns out you can blame 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.989
 it turns out to make block semi-blocks 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 and we only need five teams here 5 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.440
 candy bars i.e. it turns out now over 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.079
 conscience 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 it turns out 1 commune god gives command 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 we are responsible for putting a fence 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.799
 Well, of course you can put yourself 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 but he is necessarily the second team and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:15.840
 includes to put such a block 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 will show through the selection it is transparent I 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 Dmitry from the shows showed how to do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 Here is just greatness in team a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.579
 through our guru here's what the link on the screen 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 but dick transparent block we pass it 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.580
 through 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 so it turns out 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.800
 3 teams block he us this team 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 causes the block itself ie the block 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.240
 which you want to turn a demigod 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 it turns out let's just block and won y 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.470
 we stand as a semi-block further 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.560
 I will explain after that call any block 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:05.690
 I caused to conquer the internet 3 us land to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 regularly 3 and called it turns out we 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 it turns out he did not immediately riot here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.070
 turns off in this empty blocks 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.940
 then their transparent he here he will 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.180
 it turns out then further with 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.120
 using this command you call our 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.280
 fence favorite again may be five to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:34.170
 five put the moon is better to call and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.209
 something turns out and so 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.260
 I apologize and it turns out that when you 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.830
 on the site of the fence this unit which was for 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.830

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.620
 We will walk on it ring just 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:01.200
 Transparent such we will create for him the volume 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.830
 the last block of the command is we 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.760
 we create this fence stone fence and 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.790
 it gives the volume here we can 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.880
 walk as you can see 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.830

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.050

 Yesterday was a minute. Well, how would we 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.070
 it turns out we do not go through the dirt that created 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.860
 volume and the fence turns about worries 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:35.510
 because of the textures are not visible take extrudate 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.180
