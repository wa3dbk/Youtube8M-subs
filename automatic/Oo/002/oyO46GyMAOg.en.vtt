 car t49 is a fifth-level battle 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.200

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.869
 put almost in the top actually 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.240

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.609
 we will fulfill the plastic role of pt 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.060
 and see what we can do 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.980
 Good to give such a nice 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.080
 this standards nychku book know 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.720
 Many on this card I recall that this 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.789
 polar apparatus 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.480
 or mannerheim line when viewed by 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.399
 replay of course weird name but how 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.699
 there is why they don't 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.800
 and do not match I do not know shooting back 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.750
 pack a quarrel unfortunately I do not break through 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.910
 I 'm not sweetened here, so 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 I do not know noticed we did not notice it 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.149
 so I will take that back he walked and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.570
 accordingly, in the meantime, our guys 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.370
 went over the hill in the h8 area successfully 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.970
 all merged and, accordingly, our fight 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.420
 moves smoothly into the groove defense 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.490
 puzzle base defense that is there and such 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.700
 a worthy lesson for 100 pawns 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.159
 to defend for a long time 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.900
 accordingly we will try vodka 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.659
 work out work out this huge 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.979
 crowds of people already out of six cars that 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.340
 go to our base 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.710
 that's what made me catch on t1 heavy 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.630
 nice tanchiki each of these so that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.119
 his armor is not so strong enough 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 and accordingly most cases he 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.700
 extended to cheers with my bosses 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 here it was charged through the lips chic and 15 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.930
 podkalybernyh and akathist not yet spend a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.009
 if such goals are what are possible 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.729
 depart if necessary 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.770
 sabers lucky failed yet 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.979
 just once unscrew everything he hid it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 now try not to get here 2 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.619
 move a little farther fails 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.360
 uncomfortable started shooting him well 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.020
 almost unreal here he is finally 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.060
 will decide 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.470
 decided to go on and get arson it 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.250
 very nice 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.080
 the front rink all burned out 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.430
 enemy video 3 4 is not enough 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 to score Michael here the communication rules 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 something like that i take away 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.200
 great, the enemy has three cars left 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.290
 we actually 185 dragged my flowers 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 more accurately protected the base from the invasion of male 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.090
 land invaders and accordingly 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.799
 the enemy put the price of only two cars 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.750
 one of them is from excelsior 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:51.430
 fifth level belt tank and t-34 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.049
 or type 34 but the essence does not change as 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.610
 you see 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.459
 standard bugs are enough to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.110
 just wait to board at the tower and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.370
 other nice places 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.859
 already counted 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.340
 machines 2000 Damaga it will be something nice 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.380
 because u at 30 points and we filled 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.019

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.920
 that is, six times even repulsed 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.720

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.489
 free all own enemy 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.819

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.549

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.280

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.109
 to finish off with a wash summarize the battle 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.470

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.389

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.859
 the enemy is clear what is the best 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.419
 result on the whole map and I hit point 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.710
 he put at least all the experience 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.980
 apex 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.170

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.090
 silver clean really really 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.890
 quite a bit for a standard linear machine 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 Level five is really good 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.940
