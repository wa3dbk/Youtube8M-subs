00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.470
 many of our plans our way of dressing the sports we practice 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.680
 even our mood and our culture 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.130
 depend on the weather and climate 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.140
 and that we feel very good 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.140
 as well 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.590
 something if it's fine 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.590
 in summer it is hot and in cold winter 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.180
 this is simple because the set of weather conditions embedded 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.560
 in the long time 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.420
 in a certain region 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.420
 the weather is very stable and easy to predict 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.100
 atmospheric conditions characteristic of a specific region 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.010
 in a period of time that nobody 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.190
 stable 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.190
 and easy to predict 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.870
 and the time tomorrow 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.300
 that's another thing 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.970
 the weather 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 the conditions of the atmosphere at a particular time 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 that's much harder to predict 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 but we have 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 a way to know that tomorrow's time 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.409
 the media in salvador tÃ©lam 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.420
 they inform us every day 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.620
 of the weather forecast 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.840
 I suppose you've ever seen it 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
 but as a divine before the time that will do with appearing some fools of 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.070
 the bar north of Aragon with frequent fogs and fog banks 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 meteorologists as all scientists collect data 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 and apply the laws of physics and chemistry 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.629
 while speed and wind direction 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.399
 the temperature and humidity of the year 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.409
 analyze the atmospheric pressure at the time of the accident 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.079
 for all this work 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.649
 they have a multitude of instruments 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.649
 from thermometers to space satellites 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.839
 it seems complicated to you as they do 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.839
 Sometimes he does not understand what they tell you 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.029
 you think they are wrong many times 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.999
 It is not like this 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.109
 let's see some examples and we'll tell you some 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.649
 anticyclones high pressures cause stable time 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.649
 there will be no changes 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.259
 the storms the low pressures 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.999
 provoke 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.999
 unstable time usually me 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.939
 look at the lines of swaps the lines of equal weight 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.689
 is that there is a lot of price difference and this implies 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.059
 if they are separated 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.129
 little wind 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.409
 look also at the direction and intensity of the wind that there is where 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.179
 remember that the wind drags cold or hot air 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.179
 and as far away as the fraterns 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.109
 so you'll know what time 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.339
 you will attract customers 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:43.069
 Meteorologists measure the distance and the speed at which they move. 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.039
 cloud fronts 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.039
 so they calculate the time it will take to get there 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.919
 look at the images 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:55.840
 the now 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.840
 and in the distance that the new front crosses 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.309
 sometimes the fronts decide to have a coffee and it takes a little longer to arrive 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.709
 I hope that the next time you look at the time you do it with other eyes 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.250
 and can draw from what they tell you the information you need 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 You can also assess the wind speed by yourself 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.819
 look more closely where it comes from 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.099
 how are the clouds and if there are 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.669
 airplane scenes in the sky 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.219
 the trace clouds 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.749
 they indicate that we have humid air in the upper layers of the atmosphere 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.439
 a brake is coming 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.679
 consult on the internet the types of clouds compared with those of the closure 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.979
 you will have in your hands the time of tomorrow 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.239
 You can also get information about prices in colors
