00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Like I’ve said on many occasions, Milan is Milan 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So there was nothing to be convinced about

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I have a big desire to show what I can do and do well. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is the perfect club for me to achieve that. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Even after only a couple of days, I feel a part of a big family. I am very happy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
After just a matter of days it’s as if I’ve known the players for ages

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The welcome has been fantastic from everyone, from the staff to the players

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I have to thank them for putting me in the conditions to do well against Parma

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I knew many of the players from the squad thanks to my experience with the Italian national side 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And some others like Luca Antonelli and Cristian Zaccardo from my days at Parma

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They’ve all welcomed me right away and that’s what counts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I’ve had the chance to enter the group right away

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Everyone wants to play their part and help the team

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Milanello is the best sports complex in the world I think

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I've had the chance to play with Inzaghi in the past in a friendly match and score a goal and provide an assist

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He's a very prepared coach and we will all give 110% for him

It would be a dream to win the second star with Milan. I hope to follow in my father’s footsteps

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The difference between England and here is that there is more focus on tactics and technique

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I chose Milan because it is similar to Liverpool. They are both clubs with a big tradition and Milan was an excellent choice for me

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I have the chance to do well and I would like to make history with this great club

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I have to adapt though to a lot of new things. With time I will understand what the coach wants

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It’s obvious that everyone wants to play. Every time the coach needs me I am available
