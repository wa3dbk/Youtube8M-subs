actually<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:12.000> my<00:05:12.120> precalc<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.780> have<00:05:13.020> somebody

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
actually for my precalc I have somebody

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.940 
actually for my precalc I have somebody
that<00:05:13.410> in<00:05:13.919> freshman<00:05:14.400> year<00:05:14.430> my<00:05:14.700> sister<00:05:15.090> head<00:05:15.450> and

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
that in freshman year my sister head and

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.620 
that in freshman year my sister head and
he<00:05:16.950> was<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.280> bad<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.520> my<00:05:17.880> mom<00:05:18.090> like<00:05:18.270> requested

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
he was so bad that my mom like requested

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.390 
he was so bad that my mom like requested
that<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> never<00:05:18.900> had<00:05:19.110> him<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.500> then<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:19.919> got<00:05:20.100> him

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
that I never had him and then I got him

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040 
that I never had him and then I got him
so<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.640> think<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.300> was<00:05:21.419> gonna<00:05:21.540> talk<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.900> him<00:05:21.990> about

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
so I think I was gonna talk to him about

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.870 
so I think I was gonna talk to him about
talk<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> guidance<00:05:23.130> so<00:05:23.400> whatever<00:05:23.640> about

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
talk to the guidance so whatever about

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.840 
talk to the guidance so whatever about
that<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.720> might<00:05:24.960> switch<00:05:25.470> out<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:26.310> precalc

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
that so I might switch out of precalc

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.610 
that so I might switch out of precalc
which<00:05:27.510> will<00:05:27.690> probably<00:05:27.870> mess<00:05:28.229> up<00:05:28.380> my<00:05:28.470> schedule

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
which will probably mess up my schedule

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.400 
which will probably mess up my schedule
um<00:05:29.479> then<00:05:30.479> fourth<00:05:30.750> period<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:32.250> free<00:05:32.640> um

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
um then fourth period I have free um

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.600 
um then fourth period I have free um
which<00:05:34.410> free<00:05:34.680> pretty<00:05:34.890> much<00:05:34.979> means<00:05:35.340> like

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
which free pretty much means like

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.040 
which free pretty much means like
freshman<00:05:36.150> year<00:05:36.240> we<00:05:36.360> had<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.570> have<00:05:36.660> study<00:05:36.870> also

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.170 
which is pretty much like health and gym
I<00:06:13.770> think<00:06:13.979> that's<00:06:14.640> what<00:06:14.790> it<00:06:14.850> was<00:06:14.880> a<00:06:14.970> sophomore

I think that's what it was a sophomore

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.240 
I think that's what it was a sophomore
you<00:06:15.419> I<00:06:15.450> don't<00:06:15.570> know<00:06:15.750> what<00:06:16.440> combination<00:06:16.950> is<00:06:17.130> I

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
you I don't know what combination is I

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.370 
you I don't know what combination is I
know<00:06:17.310> it's<00:06:17.610> Jim<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:18.090> don't<00:06:18.930> know<00:06:18.990> if<00:06:19.080> its<00:06:19.229> health

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
know it's Jim I don't know if its health

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.870 
know it's Jim I don't know if its health
oh<00:06:19.590> but<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:19.860> know<00:06:19.950> we<00:06:20.190> have<00:06:20.310> to<00:06:20.430> ballroom<00:06:20.700> dance

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
oh but I know we have to ballroom dance

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.420 
oh but I know we have to ballroom dance
so<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:21.510> better<00:06:21.870> get<00:06:22.110> out

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
so I better get out
