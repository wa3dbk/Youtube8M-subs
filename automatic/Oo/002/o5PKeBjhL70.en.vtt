00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because they're big weighty heavy things

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
because they're big weighty heavy things
and<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.149> don't<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.809> anything<00:00:46.079> yet<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
and they just don't do anything yet and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619

they're<00:00:46.680> slow<00:00:47.039> well<00:00:47.789> exactly<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.510> they

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
they're slow well exactly because they

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
they're slow well exactly because they
can't<00:00:48.870> hold<00:00:49.110> their<00:00:49.260> weight<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> air<00:00:50.070> so

I never touched it again so that I got

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
I never touched it again so that I got
prawns<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.390> yes<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.740> I

went<00:01:56.189> back<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.549> thought<00:01:56.729> hey<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.909> might

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
went back to I thought hey that might

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.600 
went back to I thought hey that might
work<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.689> basically<00:01:58.140> yes<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.829> events<00:01:59.430> are

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
work so basically yes these events are

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
work so basically yes these events are
for<00:01:59.969> raid<00:02:00.360> cars<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> tried<00:02:01.079> them<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> dirt<00:02:01.560> but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
for raid cars I tried them in dirt but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.480 
for raid cars I tried them in dirt but
it<00:02:02.009> didn't<00:02:02.310> work

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it didn't work

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450 
it didn't work
race<00:02:03.329> cars<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.560> choice<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.310> these

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
race cars are the choice for these

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
race cars are the choice for these
events<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.850> our<00:02:05.880> sleep<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.600> whole<00:02:07.439> aspect

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
events on our sleep the whole aspect

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.720 
events on our sleep the whole aspect
behind<00:02:08.489> these<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.890> raid<00:02:11.400> car

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
behind these is you have the raid car

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
behind these is you have the raid car
going<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:12.420> quick<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.660> possible<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.140> get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
going there as quick as possible you get

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
going there as quick as possible you get
to<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.379> point<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> quick

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to the point is quick

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
to the point is quick
you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.340> more<00:02:14.490> points<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you can the more points you get and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.990 
you can the more points you get and
along<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.650> way<00:02:16.770> you'll<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.040> points<00:02:17.640> jotter

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
along the way you'll see points jotter

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
along the way you'll see points jotter
around<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.930> map<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.350> these<00:02:19.560> obviously

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
around the map and these obviously

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.350 
around the map and these obviously
increase<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.430> points<00:02:20.819> too<00:02:20.970> when<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.300> to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
increase your points too when you get to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.730 
increase your points too when you get to
the<00:02:21.450> top<00:02:21.600> you'll<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> bigger<00:02:22.200> bonus<00:02:22.410> now

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
the top you'll have a bigger bonus now

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.770 
the top you'll have a bigger bonus now
they<00:02:22.980> are<00:02:23.100> pretty<00:02:23.400> much<00:02:23.580> needed<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.630> I've

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they are pretty much needed what I've

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.440 
they are pretty much needed what I've
found<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:25.860> need<00:02:26.220> them<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.330> odd

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
found is you do need them on the odd

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
found is you do need them on the odd
occasion<00:02:27.480> you'll<00:02:27.959> find<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.260> where<00:02:28.380> you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
occasion you'll find them where you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.870 
occasion you'll find them where you
don't<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.920> literally<00:02:29.160> fly<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.700> those

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
don't you just literally fly up those

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.370 
don't you just literally fly up those
are<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> earlier<00:02:30.480> ones<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.230> was<00:02:31.320> like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
are the earlier ones I think it was like

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230 
are the earlier ones I think it was like
22<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> was<00:02:32.100> ridiculously<00:02:32.640> easy<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.090> don't

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
22 it was ridiculously easy you don't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.260 
22 it was ridiculously easy you don't
need<00:02:33.390> them<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.920> most<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> will<00:02:36.030> need

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
need them but most of them you will need

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.880 
need them but most of them you will need
them<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.750> would<00:02:36.930> say<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.530> sure<00:02:37.709> you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
them and I would say make sure you

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.520 
them and I would say make sure you
collect<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.430> least<00:02:38.459> two<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.450> them<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:40.290> all

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
collect at least two of them with all

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
collect at least two of them with all
the<00:02:40.800> perks<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.520> easily<00:02:41.880> get<00:02:42.030> away<00:02:42.239> with

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the perks you can easily get away with

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
the perks you can easily get away with
one<00:02:42.750> set<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.410> points<00:02:43.770> or<00:02:43.920> none<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.430> you're

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
one set of points or none if you're

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.120 
one set of points or none if you're
really<00:02:44.910> quick<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> would<00:02:46.080> say<00:02:46.260> two<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
really quick but I would say two is the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
really quick but I would say two is the
best<00:02:47.340> way<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.730> about<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.510> plan

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
best way to go about it if you can plan

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780 
best way to go about it if you can plan
a<00:02:48.989> route<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.830> did<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.100> most<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.459> them<00:02:50.640> in

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
a route like we did on most of them in

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.550 
a route like we did on most of them in
where<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.450> pick<00:02:51.600> up<00:02:51.690> two<00:02:51.870> points<00:02:52.019> easily<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
where you pick up two points easily and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.810 
where you pick up two points easily and
doesn't<00:02:52.769> cause<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> slow<00:02:53.280> down<00:02:53.430> too<00:02:53.670> much

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
doesn't cause you to slow down too much

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.400 
doesn't cause you to slow down too much
then<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.390> finish<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:55.019> done<00:02:55.230> if

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
then get to the finish you're done if

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.100 
then get to the finish you're done if
you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.280> though<00:02:56.550> obviously<00:02:57.330> go<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
you can though obviously go for all of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.410 
you can though obviously go for all of
them<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.850> literally<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.390> easiest

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
them so that is literally the easiest

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.600 
them so that is literally the easiest
way<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.260> them<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.769> raid<00:03:02.190> cards<00:03:02.489> we

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610

reasons<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.140> very<00:03:13.620> easy<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.100> do<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
reasons but it is very easy to do this

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.270 
reasons but it is very easy to do this
and<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.760> would<00:03:14.940> work<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.420> dirt<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:16.470> there's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and it would work in dirt but there's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.410 
and it would work in dirt but there's
not<00:03:17.459> much<00:03:17.610> point<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.880> doing<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.299> can

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
not much point in doing because you can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.150 
not much point in doing because you can
do<00:03:18.480> jumps<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.049> those<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.500> everything<00:03:20.040> else

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
do jumps on those so everything else

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.930 
do jumps on those so everything else
just<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:21.390> do<00:03:21.510> jumps<00:03:22.019> there's<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:23.400> me<00:03:23.790> and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
just just do jumps there's like me and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.289 
just just do jumps there's like me and
math<00:03:24.090> you've<00:03:24.299> got<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.019> many<00:03:25.200> jumps<00:03:25.709> like

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
math you've got so many jumps like

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.610 
math you've got so many jumps like
there's<00:03:27.299> points<00:03:27.810> where<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.049> get<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.410> just

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
there's points where I get to I just

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.289 
there's points where I get to I just
unplug<00:03:28.980> my<00:03:29.100> wheel<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.640> don't<00:03:29.880> even<00:03:29.970> bother

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
unplug my wheel and don't even bother

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.110 
unplug my wheel and don't even bother
anymore<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.829> use<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.400> wheel<00:03:32.579> because<00:03:32.880> he's<00:03:32.970> my

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
anymore to use my wheel because he's my

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.509 
anymore to use my wheel because he's my
controller<00:03:33.510> because<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.160> saves<00:03:35.160> me<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> house

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
controller because it saves me the house
