but you want to make sure that all these
little<00:03:50.450> knots<00:03:50.950> are<00:03:52.300> straight<00:03:53.300> just<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.500> know

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
little knots are straight just you know

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.100 
little knots are straight just you know
so<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:54.890> looks<00:03:55.040> nicer<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.670> guess<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.810> can<00:03:56.959> have

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
so it looks nicer I guess you can have

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.110 
so it looks nicer I guess you can have
it<00:03:57.260> go<00:03:57.319> more<00:03:57.950> crooked<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:58.550> then<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:58.910> means

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
it go more crooked but then that means

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.979 
it go more crooked but then that means
that<00:03:59.500> this<00:04:00.500> string<00:04:00.860> will<00:04:01.520> be<00:04:01.670> more<00:04:01.880> tight<00:04:02.920> and

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
that this string will be more tight and

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.780 
that this string will be more tight and
that<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.380> makes<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:06.980> difficult<00:04:07.220> when<00:04:07.700> you

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
that just makes it difficult when you

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:19.270 
that just makes it difficult when you
get<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.150> top

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.009 

in<00:04:19.700> fact<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.090> won't<00:04:20.239> necessarily<00:04:20.390> pull<00:04:20.900> it

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
in fact I won't necessarily pull it

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.880 
in fact I won't necessarily pull it
completely<00:04:21.320> tight<00:04:22.040> um<00:04:23.590> until<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:24.710> completely

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
completely tight um until I'm completely

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:55.360 
completely tight um until I'm completely
done<00:04:29.230> because<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.860> gets<00:04:31.490> incredibly<00:04:31.790> hard

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.390 

now<00:04:55.970> if<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.510> are<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> lefty<00:04:57.139> then<00:04:57.889> you<00:04:58.010> just<00:04:58.250> do

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
now if you are a lefty then you just do

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.820 
now if you are a lefty then you just do
this<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:58.790> other<00:04:58.940> side<00:04:59.240> so<00:05:00.050> right<00:05:00.530> here<00:05:00.770> you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
this on the other side so right here you

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.879 
this on the other side so right here you
can<00:05:00.980> see<00:05:01.160> how<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.370> bumps<00:05:01.820> are<00:05:01.940> on<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.210> side<00:05:02.449> I

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
can see how the bumps are on this side I

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.159 
can see how the bumps are on this side I
just<00:05:03.889> do<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.340> because<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.940> feel<00:05:05.540> like<00:05:05.600> it

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
just do it because I feel like it

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.230 
just do it because I feel like it
ergonomically<00:05:06.770> fits<00:05:07.040> my<00:05:07.190> hands<00:05:07.669> this<00:05:08.030> one

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
ergonomically fits my hands this one

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.060 
ergonomically fits my hands this one
doesn't<00:05:08.810> necessarily<00:05:09.139> fit<00:05:09.380> onto<00:05:09.680> my<00:05:09.770> fingers

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
doesn't necessarily fit onto my fingers

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:54.460 
doesn't necessarily fit onto my fingers
enough<00:05:10.370> for<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.699> work

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.040 

then<00:05:55.040> this<00:05:55.220> when<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:55.760> get<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.120> last<00:05:56.330> two<00:05:56.660> I

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.650 

don't<00:06:00.050> pull<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:01.070> second<00:06:01.460> last<00:06:01.670> one<00:06:01.880> tight<00:06:02.210> at

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
don't pull the second last one tight at

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.240 
don't pull the second last one tight at
all<00:06:02.860> in<00:06:03.860> fact<00:06:04.040> I<00:06:04.220> leave<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.550> pretty<00:06:04.670> loose<00:06:05.890> so<00:06:06.890> I

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
all in fact I leave it pretty loose so I

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:40.440 
all in fact I leave it pretty loose so I
can<00:06:07.550> still<00:06:07.820> go<00:06:08.030> around<00:06:12.520> still<00:06:13.520> fit<00:06:15.820> my

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.560 

and<00:06:41.020> there<00:06:41.830> we<00:06:41.920> go<00:06:41.950> I<00:06:42.340> will<00:06:43.030> do<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.270> ending

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
and there we go I will do the ending

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.910 
and there we go I will do the ending
right<00:06:44.140> now<00:06:45.660> soon<00:06:46.660> now<00:06:47.200> that<00:06:47.440> you<00:06:47.560> have<00:06:47.680> gotten

the way around and then the hard part is
just<00:07:00.250> trying<00:07:00.550> to<00:07:00.580> fit<00:07:00.790> it<00:07:00.880> through<00:07:01.060> that

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
just trying to fit it through that

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.990 
just trying to fit it through that
little<00:07:01.360> hole<00:07:01.660> space<00:07:04.920> just<00:07:05.920> keep<00:07:06.520> on<00:07:06.700> trying

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
little hole space just keep on trying
