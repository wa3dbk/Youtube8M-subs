spot never seen this thing move until
today<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:57.240> heart<00:03:57.510> was<00:03:57.540> really<00:03:57.960> beating

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
today so my heart was really beating

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:09.410 
today so my heart was really beating

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:41.520 

I'll<00:04:09.750> take<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.050> truck<00:04:10.350> appreciate<00:04:11.040> past

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.710 

well<00:04:42.530> as<00:04:42.770> promised<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.850> Ford<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.330> going<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:44.570> be

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
well as promised the Ford is going to be

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.070 
well as promised the Ford is going to be
at<00:04:44.870> my<00:04:45.020> house<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.600> took<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.900> hood

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
at my house and it is I took the hood

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.750 
at my house and it is I took the hood
off<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.470> can<00:04:48.680> get<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.040> motor<00:04:49.250> easily

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
off so I can get to the motor easily

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.470 
off so I can get to the motor easily
it's<00:04:50.270> over<00:04:50.510> there<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:52.640> still<00:04:53.060> has<00:04:53.240> no

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
it's over there and it still has no

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.050 
it's over there and it still has no
spark<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.080> just<00:04:54.560> hooked<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.890> up<00:04:54.980> with<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.640> battery

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
spark I just hooked it up with a battery

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.420 
spark I just hooked it up with a battery
to<00:04:56.180> turn<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.510> over<00:04:56.630> again<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.950> I'll<00:04:58.280> do<00:04:58.400> a

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
to turn it over again but I'll do a

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:13.820 
to turn it over again but I'll do a
close-up<00:04:58.760> with<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.210> motor

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.279 

my<00:05:14.460> guess<00:05:14.669> it's<00:05:14.909> because<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.360> these<00:05:15.780> wires<00:05:16.020> are

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
my guess it's because of these wires are

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.270 
my guess it's because of these wires are
all<00:05:16.470> just<00:05:16.740> hanging<00:05:17.069> all<00:05:17.250> over<00:05:17.300> I'm<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.599> sure

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
all just hanging all over I'm not sure

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.170 
all just hanging all over I'm not sure
guess<00:05:20.280> I'm<00:05:20.430> going<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.580> have<00:05:20.699> to<00:05:20.789> sand<00:05:21.090> the

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
guess I'm going to have to sand the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:56.110 
guess I'm going to have to sand the
points

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.180 

you
