foods now if you're detoxing you're

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880

or<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> lifestyle<00:01:27.930> habit<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> had<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> past

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
or a lifestyle habit you had in the past

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
or a lifestyle habit you had in the past
or<00:01:29.220> maybe<00:01:29.759> exposure<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.720> pollution<00:01:30.900> or

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
or maybe exposure to pollution or

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
or maybe exposure to pollution or
radiation<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.700> suggestion<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> eat<00:01:33.810> as

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
radiation so my suggestion is to eat as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.280 
radiation so my suggestion is to eat as
cleanly<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.460> simply<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.240> possible<00:01:36.360> whole
