one of the most important aspects of

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.209 
one of the most important aspects of
soft<00:00:12.670> plastics<00:00:13.120> fishing<00:00:13.510> is<00:00:13.860> rigging<00:00:14.860> a<00:00:14.980> soft

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
soft plastics fishing is rigging a soft

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.429 
soft plastics fishing is rigging a soft
plastic<00:00:15.400> to<00:00:15.759> your<00:00:15.910> cheek<00:00:16.090> head<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.540> also<00:00:16.750> your

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
plastic to your cheek head and also your

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.280 
plastic to your cheek head and also your

jig head and plastic selection now to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.139 
jig head and plastic selection now to
select<00:00:20.619> correctly<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:21.610> need<00:00:21.759> to<00:00:21.880> have<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.029> look

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
select correctly you need to have a look

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.490 
select correctly you need to have a look
at<00:00:22.270> conditions<00:00:22.480> I've<00:00:23.050> had<00:00:23.169> a<00:00:23.200> look<00:00:23.380> this

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
at conditions I've had a look this

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.370 
at conditions I've had a look this
morning<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.000> lot<00:00:25.180> of<00:00:25.210> tidal<00:00:25.509> flow<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.290> I'm

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
morning not a lot of tidal flow and I'm

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.600 
morning not a lot of tidal flow and I'm
probably<00:00:26.590> only<00:00:26.770> going<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.070> be<00:00:27.130> fishing<00:00:27.369> in

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
probably only going to be fishing in

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.700 
probably only going to be fishing in
about<00:00:27.820> 4<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.210> 5<00:00:28.239> foot<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.899> maximum<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.470> water

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
about 4 to 5 foot and maximum of water

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.069 
about 4 to 5 foot and maximum of water
so<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.189> don't<00:00:30.579> need<00:00:30.700> a<00:00:30.759> massive<00:00:31.090> jig<00:00:31.450> head<00:00:31.630> just

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
so I don't need a massive jig head just

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.569 
so I don't need a massive jig head just
one<00:00:32.290> that's<00:00:32.470> going<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.680> get<00:00:32.950> me<00:00:33.070> down<00:00:33.309> near<00:00:33.489> the

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
one that's going to get me down near the

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.029 
one that's going to get me down near the
bottom<00:00:33.789> more<00:00:34.600> importantly<00:00:35.170> would<00:00:35.379> be<00:00:35.559> my<00:00:35.769> hook

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
bottom more importantly would be my hook

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.689 
bottom more importantly would be my hook
size<00:00:36.340> choice<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.840> my<00:00:37.989> plastic<00:00:38.320> I<00:00:38.769> don't<00:00:39.519> want

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
size choice to my plastic I don't want

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.279 
size choice to my plastic I don't want
the<00:00:39.789> hook<00:00:39.940> coming<00:00:40.300> too<00:00:40.539> far<00:00:40.809> back<00:00:41.079> and

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
the hook coming too far back and

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.410 
the hook coming too far back and
impeding<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.219> action<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> tail<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.300> I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
impeding the action of the tail and I

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.180 
impeding the action of the tail and I
don't<00:00:43.570> want<00:00:43.839> it<00:00:43.929> too<00:00:44.109> far<00:00:44.379> forward<00:00:44.679> where<00:00:45.100> I'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
don't want it too far forward where I'm

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.889 
don't want it too far forward where I'm
going<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.460> get<00:00:45.550> short<00:00:45.910> strikes<00:00:46.300> from<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.570> fish

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
going to get short strikes from the fish

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.779 
going to get short strikes from the fish
I<00:00:47.109> want<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.620> probably<00:00:47.920> coming<00:00:48.219> out<00:00:48.370> right<00:00:48.579> in

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
I want it probably coming out right in

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.489 
I want it probably coming out right in
the<00:00:48.879> center<00:00:49.179> of<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.359> bait<00:00:49.570> is<00:00:50.019> pretty<00:00:50.320> much

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
the center of the bait is pretty much

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.529 
the center of the bait is pretty much
ideal<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:51.280> once<00:00:51.489> I've<00:00:51.640> chosen<00:00:51.850> my<00:00:52.149> hook<00:00:52.300> size

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
ideal so once I've chosen my hook size

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.209 
ideal so once I've chosen my hook size
then<00:00:53.109> I<00:00:53.140> have<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.499> choose<00:00:53.710> my<00:00:53.769> weight

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
then I have to choose my weight

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.040 
then I have to choose my weight
something<00:00:54.760> as<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.149> said<00:00:55.359> it's<00:00:55.510> going<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.749> get<00:00:55.870> me

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
something as I said it's going to get me

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.680 
something as I said it's going to get me
down<00:00:56.230> there<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:56.710> not<00:00:57.100> be<00:00:57.280> too<00:00:57.489> bulky<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.149> hard

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
down there and not be too bulky and hard

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.720 
down there and not be too bulky and hard
to<00:00:58.929> work<00:00:59.109> you<00:00:59.319> want<00:00:59.530> what<00:00:59.739> you<00:00:59.949> do<00:01:00.129> at<00:01:00.249> this<00:01:00.460> end

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
to work you want what you do at this end

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.329 
to work you want what you do at this end
to<00:01:01.329> be<00:01:01.449> transferred<00:01:02.079> down<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.710> your<00:01:02.890> jig<00:01:03.129> head

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
to be transferred down to your jig head

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.179 
to be transferred down to your jig head
as<00:01:03.670> easily<00:01:04.030> as<00:01:04.360> possible<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.799> be<00:01:05.920> able<00:01:06.009> to

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
as easily as possible and to be able to

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.100 
as easily as possible and to be able to
detect<00:01:06.700> those<00:01:06.939> bites<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.540> having<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.899> large

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
detect those bites and having a large

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.850 
detect those bites and having a large
jig<00:01:08.500> head

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
jig head

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.280 
jig head
sometimes<00:01:09.520> you'll<00:01:10.090> lose<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:10.360> detection<00:01:11.140> and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
sometimes you'll lose that detection and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.060 
sometimes you'll lose that detection and
that<00:01:11.740> sensitivity<00:01:13.079> so<00:01:14.079> now<00:01:14.229> it's<00:01:14.439> time<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.710> rig

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
that sensitivity so now it's time to rig

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.889 
that sensitivity so now it's time to rig
your<00:01:15.100> soft<00:01:15.460> plastic<00:01:15.880> which<00:01:16.299> is<00:01:16.360> extremely

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
your soft plastic which is extremely

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.660 
your soft plastic which is extremely
important<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.500> must<00:01:17.680> be<00:01:17.829> rigged<00:01:18.100> straight<00:01:18.460> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
important it must be rigged straight and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.130 
important it must be rigged straight and
it<00:01:18.759> must<00:01:19.030> swim<00:01:19.299> naturally

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
it must swim naturally

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.530 
it must swim naturally
way<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.829> do<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.520> get<00:01:21.729> your<00:01:21.880> chosen<00:01:22.210> jig

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
way to do that is get your chosen jig

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.679 
way to do that is get your chosen jig
head<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:22.930> lay<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.290> against<00:01:23.770> your<00:01:23.890> plastic

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
head and lay it against your plastic

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.719 
head and lay it against your plastic
okay<00:01:25.689> so<00:01:26.229> your<00:01:26.380> KP<00:01:26.770> hoops<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.250> exit<00:01:27.579> just

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
okay so your KP hoops going to exit just

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.819 
okay so your KP hoops going to exit just
behind<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.210> little<00:01:28.360> dorsal<00:01:28.840> fin<00:01:28.990> here<00:01:29.200> you

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
behind this little dorsal fin here you

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.459 
behind this little dorsal fin here you
can<00:01:30.009> mark<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.520> if<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.820> want<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:32.170> what<00:01:32.380> you

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
can mark that if you want then what you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.840 
can mark that if you want then what you
need<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.770> do<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.009> you<00:01:33.100> need<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.340> come<00:01:33.549> straight

need to do is you need to come straight
through<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:35.020> center<00:01:35.469> make<00:01:35.710> sure<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.250> go

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
through the center make sure that you go

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.940 
through the center make sure that you go
through<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.700> middle<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.240> your<00:01:38.079> soft<00:01:38.530> plastic
