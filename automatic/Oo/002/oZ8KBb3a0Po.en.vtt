 we are falling here in the glory of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.520
 great thrill for bringing this gameplay 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.540
 dragon there the scene looks really pretty 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.869
 Good people in this first video I 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 I prepared a basic analysis of the game not 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.380
 I played a little bit him to understand a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.720
 little about the dynamics is for me to be able to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.470
 bring my honest opinion to you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 huh 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 and in my first opinion this game 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 It's just great, is not it? 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.210
 Because you can play as a lego in the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.369
 game y'know type the league in parts 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.890
 old look at how much credit this 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.440
 how you play old everything 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.519
 kind of human credit is not too much 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.070
 that old 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.720
 with this it becomes nostalgic to whom 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.090
 You never played the lego in my life. 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.519
 reply 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.590
 almost no one in this world does not take one 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.060
 something that everyone likes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.070
 playing lego, my son, I hope 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.269
 To talk at home, I get it, it's like playing. 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.859
 because it's fun 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.610
 imagine here man, I can ride 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.410
 lego a truncated game much handed 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 same time carla phenomenal 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.310
 Cool old man in the dragon as far as you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.410
 it's on top of it's box type 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.850
 Lego is on and beauty is the point. 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.130
 the stronger you can ride . 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.710
 any way if you want the 800 thousand feet 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.810
 any how to mix employees and has 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.390
 paint you can pass the paint brush and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.760
 any mattress can also be 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.500
 creative a supposed here I will show 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.990
 another part that has to be very cool 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.680
 You see, there are these parts that 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.040
 Can you pick up the league floor? 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.570
 you no longer have to get round 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.140
 square how you died too 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.750
 You show me back, you do not miss anything. 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:31.400

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:38.760
 morning mountain and also has like you 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:44.100
 2 also came out in a square to do 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.810
 some buildings I could say 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.620
 abstract ne 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.650
 but beauty face has a plethora of 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.860
 things for you to do, right? 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.120
 I do not know everything just the basics so 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.120
 could you understand 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.250
 also has legal customization of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.050
 old character is seeing here ok you 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.000
 are you going to meet the animals? 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.220
 You'll see you watch the bug if 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.070
 learn his clothes he will have something 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.510
 I've ridden here a gunman will 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.510
 leave right here I liked it 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.859
 We have a gunslinger here. 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.450
 happy right the smiling and cheerful 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.440
 Can you assemble various shapes 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:31.320
 can put the beard without a beard and mustache 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:35.850
 the ball was on the ball here too 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.440
 also the crazy old man this detail he 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.360
 recalls as a child catch 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.650
 some little dolls that I caught reeves 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.700
 magazines ne 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.180
 good now let's go to the critical point 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.300
 huh 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.849
 only criticism is slight because the game 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.699
 the alpha phase people just left or have 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.949
 too much floor ahead of you 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.860
 floor to say very very much show 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.300
 ground to develop the game is not 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.550
 good 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.789
 my criticism which they said 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.740
 I love that I came and I surpass minecraft is 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.780
 With this game this game and man 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.889
 craft sending to 0 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.650
 if the question of them was construction 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.449
 they won with won as master 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.580
 ana because the construction of the game 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.520
 using the pieces of lego doing all the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.909
 things won from millions to 0 of 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.050
 Maneco hefty weirder 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.900
 survival is dread that thing 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.500
 Max , you have to prepare for the night. 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.629
 catching resource meant for you to move on 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.400
 good night to do home understood 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.650
 if it depends on a house for you 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.620
 to die at night and this 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.620
 In this game you do not have you, you're the one. 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.150
 face in the game if not die is like it's super 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.159
 easy game that you play a little bit 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.319
 because I did not even get into the brain any more 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.900
 a dragon that I have to climb is 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.460
 be able to use botafogo the skulls that 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.740
 come to pick up from time to time at night or 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.050
 two punches forest that does not have 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.690
 adrenaline none of the game felt in the game 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.690
 The only good thing is to jump in the beginning now only 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.800
 to build even if you can use 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.639
 your creativity 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.960
 but let's see what they will transform 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.849
 if they speak that to overcome microsoft 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.930
 expects that it will surpass itself and in 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:21.150
 thing about you being tense playing because 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.590
 This is what is cool about the craft district. 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.719
 This is cool, this thing from you. 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.550
 be able to build this one of 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.690
 home because you need to have a field 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.520
 to protect yourself 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.620
 In this game, the house is not only built for 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.199
 vanity for now for now on 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.979
 Alpha people have a lot of ground to 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.599
 front right 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.159
 good I will give an explanation that also 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.080
 also your coins here is that you will 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.300
 to win in the course of the historical game 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.069
 equals and kills animals and wins right 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.400
 and with these coins you can buy 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.740
 What do you buy from the coast comes with 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.150
 affection because the issue the things that 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.819
 I heard here 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.610
 maybe here rates coin generating coins is a 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.259
 item that was right and what if I want 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.969
 I can ride him I have to buy 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.169
 he comes here I buy it where I 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:04.419
 I can do now, I can do it for him. 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.400
 place in every thing you see if you can 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.960
 buy it so you have to explore 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.009
 enough for you to find enough 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.439

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:28.569
