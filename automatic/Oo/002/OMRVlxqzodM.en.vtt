little<00:03:25.660> bit<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.870> strength<00:03:26.670> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
little bit of strength so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.380 
little bit of strength so
looking<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:30.520> when<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.670> drilled<00:03:32.030> little

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
looking like that when I drilled little

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.980 
looking like that when I drilled little
poles<00:03:32.660> here<00:03:33.280> then<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.430> ends<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.690> could<00:03:35.870> be

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
poles here then the ends so I could be

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.590 
poles here then the ends so I could be
these<00:03:36.140> wire<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:36.740> string<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.400> attach<00:03:37.760> things<00:03:38.090> so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
these wire or string to attach things so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.850 
these wire or string to attach things so
that<00:03:38.930> might<00:03:39.110> be<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.200> good<00:03:39.319> idea<00:03:39.380> if<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.709> can

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
that might be a good idea if you can

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.550 
that might be a good idea if you can
drill<00:03:40.130> some<00:03:40.280> little<00:03:40.459> holes<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:42.170> I've<00:03:42.319> glued

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
drill some little holes now I've glued

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.380 
drill some little holes now I've glued
that<00:03:42.770> mast<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.250> place<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.300> don't

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
that mast in place here but you don't

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.640 
that mast in place here but you don't
want<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.170> want<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.560> be

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
want to just do that you want it to be

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.410 
want to just do that you want it to be
strong<00:03:45.890> jacks<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.760> want<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.000> get<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.240> there

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
strong jacks you want to get in there

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.720 
strong jacks you want to get in there
and<00:03:47.630> glue<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.350> down<00:03:48.500> in<00:03:48.709> here<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.160> get<00:03:49.580> that

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
and glue it down in here to get that

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.920 
and glue it down in here to get that
done<00:03:49.910> any<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.270> can<00:03:50.390> I've<00:03:50.570> been<00:03:50.660> using<00:03:50.810> the

done any of you can I've been using the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.810 
done any of you can I've been using the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
thin wire something like that just to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.250 
thin wire something like that just to
maintain<00:04:11.360> its<00:04:11.540> strength<00:04:11.780> although<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.170> was

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
maintain its strength although it was

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.659 
maintain its strength although it was
pretty<00:04:12.290> strong<00:04:12.860> without<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.310> couple

with<00:05:05.990> it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
with it

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.909 
with it
I'm<00:05:06.860> going<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.130> take<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> servos<00:05:07.820> out<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.150> this

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
I'm going to take the servos out of this

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.350 
I'm going to take the servos out of this
you<00:05:09.919> know<00:05:10.040> that<00:05:10.190> operate<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.550> flaps<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
you know that operate the flaps and the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.630 
you know that operate the flaps and the
elevator<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.919> I'm<00:05:13.010> going<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.190> use<00:05:13.340> them<00:05:13.490> in

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
elevator and I'm going to use them in

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760 
elevator and I'm going to use them in
the<00:05:13.729> boat<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.360> kind<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.840> find<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.140> I<00:05:15.260> will<00:05:15.500> show

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
the boat you kind of find it I will show

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.150 
the boat you kind of find it I will show
you<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.919> little<00:05:16.250> bit<00:05:16.340> more<00:05:16.550> about<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:18.100> okay<00:05:19.100> so

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
you a little bit more about that okay so

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.620 
you a little bit more about that okay so
now<00:05:19.490> let<00:05:19.640> me<00:05:19.669> explain<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.330> little<00:05:20.539> bit

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
now let me explain to you a little bit

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.870 
now let me explain to you a little bit
about<00:05:20.930> how<00:05:21.229> I'll<00:05:21.890> use<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.190> electronics<00:05:22.760> and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
about how I'll use the electronics and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.350 
about how I'll use the electronics and
then

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
then

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.950 
then
and<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:24.140> is<00:05:24.590> really<00:05:24.860> only<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.640> few<00:05:26.540> components

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
and this is really only a few components

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.360 
and this is really only a few components
when<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.040> have<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.220> remote-controlled<00:05:29.350> object

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
when you have a remote-controlled object

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.430 
when you have a remote-controlled object
inside<00:05:31.370> that<00:05:31.720> optic<00:05:32.720> like<00:05:32.840> that<00:05:33.020> car<00:05:33.230> that

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
inside that optic like that car that

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.870 
inside that optic like that car that
plane<00:05:33.680> is<00:05:33.890> going<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.190> little<00:05:34.370> receiver

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
plane is going to be a little receiver

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.300 
plane is going to be a little receiver
and<00:05:35.300> that<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.110> receiver<00:05:36.470> right<00:05:36.740> here<00:05:37.100> and

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
and that is the receiver right here and

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.130 
and that is the receiver right here and
this<00:05:37.730> is<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:37.970> antenna<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.480> comes<00:05:38.690> out<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
this is the antenna that comes out of it

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.010 
this is the antenna that comes out of it
so<00:05:39.560> when<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.860> work<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.580> transmitter<00:05:41.180> the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
so when you work the transmitter the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.290 
so when you work the transmitter the
signal<00:05:42.440> is<00:05:42.500> picked<00:05:42.680> up<00:05:42.830> by<00:05:42.890> that<00:05:43.370> by<00:05:44.270> the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
signal is picked up by that by the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.600 
signal is picked up by that by the
receiver<00:05:44.840> and<00:05:45.200> then<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:45.860> will<00:05:46.010> turn<00:05:46.220> on<00:05:46.400> and

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
receiver and then it will turn on and

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.960 
receiver and then it will turn on and
off<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:47.120> various<00:05:47.450> objects<00:05:48.200> by<00:05:48.890> your<00:05:49.130> handheld

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
off the various objects by your handheld

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.410 
off the various objects by your handheld
controller<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:52.460> little<00:05:52.760> motion<00:05:52.910> is

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
controller and that the little motion is

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.240 
controller and that the little motion is
affected<00:05:53.930> by<00:05:54.050> this<00:05:54.110> thing<00:05:54.440> called<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.860> servo

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
affected by this thing called the servo

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.170 
affected by this thing called the servo
and<00:05:55.820> this<00:05:55.940> goes<00:05:56.240> back<00:05:56.270> and<00:05:56.690> forth<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:58.180> that's

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
and this goes back and forth and that's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.180 
and this goes back and forth and that's
where<00:05:59.330> we<00:05:59.390> get<00:05:59.510> our<00:05:59.660> motion<00:06:00.020> from<00:06:00.170> so<00:06:00.680> that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
where we get our motion from so that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.310 
where we get our motion from so that
powers<00:06:01.520> that<00:06:01.670> up<00:06:01.820> and<00:06:02.300> after<00:06:02.450> that<00:06:02.630> all<00:06:03.290> we

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
powers that up and after that all we

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.130 
powers that up and after that all we
need<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.040> battery<00:06:04.340> so<00:06:04.850> I<00:06:04.880> took<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.300> exact

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
need is the battery so I took the exact

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.660 
need is the battery so I took the exact
battery<00:06:06.530> out<00:06:06.740> of<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:06.950> system<00:06:07.160> whatever

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
battery out of that system whatever

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.420 
battery out of that system whatever
batteries<00:06:08.150> you<00:06:08.270> need<00:06:08.420> that<00:06:08.660> come<00:06:08.840> with<00:06:09.020> that

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
batteries you need that come with that

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.210 
batteries you need that come with that
control<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.730> RC<00:06:11.360> car<00:06:11.660> or<00:06:12.080> whatever<00:06:12.350> it<00:06:12.470> is<00:06:12.590> you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
control the RC car or whatever it is you

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.030 
control the RC car or whatever it is you
know<00:06:13.310> use<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:13.880> so<00:06:14.600> I<00:06:14.630> kinda<00:06:15.620> don't<00:06:15.740> have<00:06:15.920> it

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
know use that so I kinda don't have it

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.130 
know use that so I kinda don't have it
connected<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.640> let<00:06:17.270> me<00:06:17.360> look<00:06:17.510> let's<00:06:17.930> take<00:06:18.080> a

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
connected so let me look let's take a

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.140 
connected so let me look let's take a
quick<00:06:18.470> look<00:06:18.740> at<00:06:19.040> how<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.280> did<00:06:19.610> this<00:06:19.760> little

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
quick look at how I did this little

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.620 
quick look at how I did this little
runner<00:06:21.160> so<00:06:22.160> what<00:06:22.880> happens<00:06:23.150> is<00:06:23.210> there's<00:06:23.390> a<00:06:23.420> rod

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
runner so what happens is there's a rod

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.160 
runner so what happens is there's a rod
here<00:06:24.140> and<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.040> can<00:06:25.160> see<00:06:25.510> this<00:06:26.510> pushes<00:06:26.900> it<00:06:27.020> and

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
here and you can see this pushes it and

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.010 
here and you can see this pushes it and
all<00:06:27.320> this<00:06:27.500> water<00:06:27.770> is<00:06:28.040> a<00:06:28.340> piece<00:06:28.610> of<00:06:28.820> balsa<00:06:29.630> wood

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
all this water is a piece of balsa wood

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.480 
all this water is a piece of balsa wood
that<00:06:30.500> painted<00:06:31.070> and<00:06:31.390> it's<00:06:32.390> connected<00:06:32.990> to<00:06:33.170> this

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
that painted and it's connected to this

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.190 
that painted and it's connected to this
this<00:06:34.490> piece<00:06:34.700> of<00:06:34.910> this<00:06:35.150> is<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.360> piece<00:06:35.870> of<00:06:36.020> balsa

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
this piece of this is a piece of balsa

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.200 
this piece of this is a piece of balsa
wood<00:06:36.350> itself<00:06:36.740> and<00:06:37.250> this<00:06:37.370> is<00:06:37.430> glued<00:06:37.730> right<00:06:37.760> down

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
wood itself and this is glued right down

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.900 
wood itself and this is glued right down
to<00:06:38.450> this<00:06:38.770> platform<00:06:39.770> so<00:06:40.190> it's<00:06:40.340> strong<00:06:40.700> and

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
to this platform so it's strong and

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.220 
to this platform so it's strong and
secure<00:06:41.650> this<00:06:42.650> one<00:06:42.980> is<00:06:43.910> taped<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.690> that<00:06:44.960> one

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
secure this one is taped to that one

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.930 
secure this one is taped to that one
with<00:06:45.560> two<00:06:45.860> pieces<00:06:46.190> of<00:06:46.310> duct<00:06:46.490> tape<00:06:46.550> I<00:06:46.790> got<00:06:46.820> a

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
with two pieces of duct tape I got a

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.580 
with two pieces of duct tape I got a
piece<00:06:47.120> of<00:06:47.240> duct<00:06:47.360> tape<00:06:47.390> on<00:06:47.630> this<00:06:47.780> side<00:06:47.960> piece<00:06:48.470> of

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
piece of duct tape on this side piece of

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.230 
piece of duct tape on this side piece of
duct<00:06:48.770> tape<00:06:48.830> on<00:06:49.040> this<00:06:49.160> side<00:06:49.400> so<00:06:49.760> it<00:06:49.850> acts<00:06:50.030> like<00:06:50.150> a

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
duct tape on this side so it acts like a

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.840 
duct tape on this side so it acts like a
hinge<00:06:50.570> so<00:06:51.230> it'll<00:06:51.380> freely<00:06:51.710> hinge<00:06:51.980> when<00:06:52.670> this

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
hinge so it'll freely hinge when this

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.690 
hinge so it'll freely hinge when this
controller<00:06:53.330> is<00:06:53.450> operated<00:06:54.340> so<00:06:55.340> that's<00:06:55.520> really

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
controller is operated so that's really

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.850 
controller is operated so that's really
all<00:06:56.000> it<00:06:56.030> is<00:06:56.210> I<00:06:56.540> can't<00:06:56.990> tell<00:06:57.050> you<00:06:57.200> the<00:06:57.320> specifics

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
all it is I can't tell you the specifics

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.920 
all it is I can't tell you the specifics
of<00:06:58.010> whatever<00:06:58.190> RC<00:06:58.700> control<00:06:59.150> unit<00:06:59.630> you're<00:06:59.780> going

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
of whatever RC control unit you're going

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.960 
of whatever RC control unit you're going
to<00:07:00.020> use<00:07:00.200> but<00:07:00.800> that<00:07:00.950> gives<00:07:01.070> you<00:07:01.190> the<00:07:01.340> basic<00:07:01.670> idea

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
to use but that gives you the basic idea

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.240 
to use but that gives you the basic idea
you've<00:07:02.180> got<00:07:02.360> your<00:07:02.510> truck<00:07:02.660> your<00:07:02.810> receiver<00:07:03.260> with

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
you've got your truck your receiver with

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.760 
you've got your truck your receiver with
an<00:07:04.400> antenna<00:07:04.730> you've<00:07:05.480> got<00:07:05.660> your<00:07:05.840> own<00:07:06.050> servo

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
an antenna you've got your own servo

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.520 
an antenna you've got your own servo
unit<00:07:07.040> that<00:07:07.490> makes<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:07.880> motion<00:07:08.330> you<00:07:09.200> get<00:07:09.350> your

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
unit that makes the motion you get your

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.670 
unit that makes the motion you get your
battery<00:07:09.890> and<00:07:10.190> then<00:07:10.820> you've<00:07:11.000> got<00:07:11.270> your

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
battery and then you've got your

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.500 
battery and then you've got your
controlled<00:07:12.680> ride<00:07:13.030> so<00:07:14.030> you<00:07:14.090> hook<00:07:14.300> that<00:07:14.330> up

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 
controlled ride so you hook that up

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.010 
controlled ride so you hook that up
somehow<00:07:14.900> to<00:07:15.110> that<00:07:15.500> so<00:07:16.330> the<00:07:17.330> motion<00:07:17.750> of<00:07:17.870> that

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
somehow to that so the motion of that

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.350 
somehow to that so the motion of that
servo<00:07:18.440> will<00:07:19.190> move<00:07:20.050> the<00:07:21.050> rudder

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
servo will move the rudder

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.320 
servo will move the rudder
what's<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.420> plus<00:07:23.570> that<00:07:23.660> I<00:07:24.050> would<00:07:24.320> I<00:07:25.330> would

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
what's the plus that I would I would

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.720 
what's the plus that I would I would
definitely<00:07:26.960> put<00:07:27.500> a<00:07:27.770> lot<00:07:27.980> of<00:07:28.100> this<00:07:28.190> in<00:07:28.400> some

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:28.730 
definitely put a lot of this in some

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.510 
definitely put a lot of this in some
kind<00:07:28.940> of<00:07:29.000> foam

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
kind of foam

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.950 
kind of foam
something<00:07:29.789> to<00:07:29.879> keep<00:07:30.060> it<00:07:30.240> watertight<00:07:30.569> because

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
something to keep it watertight because

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.939 
something to keep it watertight because
you<00:07:31.020> don't<00:07:31.169> want<00:07:31.289> more<00:07:31.410> to<00:07:31.560> getting<00:07:31.770> on<00:07:31.889> the

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:31.949 
you don't want more to getting on the

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.159 
you don't want more to getting on the
battery<00:07:32.310> or<00:07:32.550> the<00:07:32.610> electronics<00:07:33.419> or<00:07:33.660> the<00:07:33.810> servo

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:34.169 
battery or the electronics or the servo

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:36.140 
battery or the electronics or the servo
or<00:07:34.319> anything<00:07:34.530> so<00:07:34.860> I<00:07:35.069> would<00:07:35.370> actually<00:07:35.490> maybe

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
or anything so I would actually maybe

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.909 
or anything so I would actually maybe
carve<00:07:36.479> myself<00:07:36.870> a<00:07:36.930> little<00:07:37.050> poem<00:07:37.319> then<00:07:37.650> put<00:07:37.889> a

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 
carve myself a little poem then put a

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.570 
carve myself a little poem then put a
cover<00:07:38.159> on<00:07:38.250> it<00:07:38.370> so<00:07:39.150> all<00:07:39.180> this<00:07:39.599> is<00:07:40.430> pretty<00:07:41.430> much

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 
cover on it so all this is pretty much

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.610 
cover on it so all this is pretty much
water<00:07:42.090> resistant<00:07:42.659> water<00:07:42.840> tight<00:07:43.199> or<00:07:43.409> at<00:07:43.500> least

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
water resistant water tight or at least

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.710 
water resistant water tight or at least
water<00:07:43.860> resistant<00:07:44.550> it<00:07:44.759> even<00:07:44.970> wrap<00:07:45.180> a<00:07:45.210> lot<00:07:45.479> of<00:07:45.599> it

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 
water resistant it even wrap a lot of it

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.749 
water resistant it even wrap a lot of it
in<00:07:45.840> plastic<00:07:46.050> bags<00:07:46.440> or<00:07:46.740> rubber<00:07:46.979> bands<00:07:47.430> because

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 
in plastic bags or rubber bands because

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.219 
in plastic bags or rubber bands because
it's<00:07:48.000> going<00:07:48.120> to<00:07:48.180> be<00:07:48.270> on<00:07:48.389> the<00:07:48.509> water<00:07:48.690> so<00:07:48.840> it's

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:49.229 
it's going to be on the water so it's

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:52.399 
it's going to be on the water so it's
going<00:07:49.440> to<00:07:49.560> get<00:07:49.710> wet<00:07:49.919> so<00:07:50.819> so<00:07:51.210> that's<00:07:51.389> it<00:07:51.569> that's

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:52.409 
going to get wet so so that's it that's

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.499 
going to get wet so so that's it that's
the<00:07:52.560> bottle<00:07:52.889> boat<00:07:53.039> project<00:07:53.520> I<00:07:53.729> get<00:07:54.240> lots<00:07:54.449> more

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509 
the bottle boat project I get lots more

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:01.399 
the bottle boat project I get lots more
stuff<00:07:54.810> to<00:07:54.930> my<00:07:55.020> website<00:07:55.470> at<00:07:59.210> www.viki<00:08:00.259> to<00:08:01.259> be

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:01.409 
stuff to my website at www.viki to be

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:03.080 
stuff to my website at www.viki to be
great<00:08:01.590> I'd<00:08:02.039> love<00:08:02.099> to<00:08:02.460> see<00:08:02.580> it<00:08:02.699> I<00:08:02.759> put<00:08:02.909> them<00:08:03.000> on

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090 
great I'd love to see it I put them on
