00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello friends subscribers and guests 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 channel today we talk about beautiful 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.700
 indoor plant which is called 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.490
 episcia she belongs to the family of disney 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.020
 first of all it 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.570
 foliage plant but can 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.850
 considered partly by 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.800
 flowering common and scribes in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.610
 tropical forests of central and southern 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 of america 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.790
 Brazil mexico Colombia and also longer 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.860
 and on the Antilles the most successful 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.680
 pizza place 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.300
 western or eastern windows on the south 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 windows plants are placed 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.560
 if you need something in this room scribes 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.460
 place the gruel on the wall at a distance 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 two or three meters from the window episcia better 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 all growing with bright but scattered 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 In the light, it does not tolerate direct sun 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 rays 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.570
 this may lead to loss of color 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.760
 yellowing twisting and drying 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.560
 leaves and burns on them 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540
 stains 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.040
 plants respond well to 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.210
 lighting up the lamps 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.309
 especially in winter 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 with a lack of light, the leaves begin 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.020
 fade and lose their pattern 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 they thin the stalks lengthen and and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 decreases the number of side shoots 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.190
 bloom comes later and pizza 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 shorter than usual against the background of this plant 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.649
 immunity decreases it becomes very 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.690
 over-wetting intimacy 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.610
 central heating batteries 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.259
 significantly slows growth so pizza 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.440
 need to be placed at some distance 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.409
 from heat sources at the same time it does not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.560
 likes drafts 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.119
 episation is a very thermophilic plant 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.780
 the optimum temperature for it lies in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.220
 interval 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.740
 22 27 degrees during the day and 1820 at night 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 lowering the temperature to 15 degrees 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.840
 the plant dies 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.119
 episcia needs high humidity 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.490
 air but do not spray the leaves 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.090
 as the hairs will delay too much 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.640
 moisture 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.219
 you can spray the air at a distance 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.649
 not less than 50 centimeters from the plant 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.929
 also to increase air humidity 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.880
 put the plant pot in the pan with 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.380
 wet top 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.110
 water and pizza so that the land is always 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 was a bit wet in no case 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.060
 can not be allowed as excess moisture such 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.070
 shortage watered pot avoiding 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.010
 water droplets on the leaves 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.140
 In the summer I water often about once a day. 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.420
 two or three days but you need to wait 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 when topsoil will look like 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.370
 dry in winter should be rare 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 somewhere one twice a week in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.720
 battery power dependent 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.910
 central heating should be avoided 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.260
 marshiness if a lot of water 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.260
 accumulates in the pan 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.750
 it needs to be drained 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.800
 be room temperature gently and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.620
 well-built land mix for 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.570
 pizza consists of ground leaf peat and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.060
 sand behind the advent of charcoal 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.740
 can use specialized 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.920
 ground mixture for saintpaulia 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.890
 or for disney your bottom is sure 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.740
 put the drain in the period of active growth 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.300
 spring and summer fertilize once in two weeks 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.330
 complex mineral solution 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.910
 fertilizer dose is reduced twice 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.320
 relative to the packaging 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.660
 since the disaster is extremely negative 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.700
 react to period of clay 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.250
 the plant is transplanted every two years in 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.870
 wide shallow pots in which 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.959
 there will be enough room for rooting 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.150
 new sockets hand over konev com 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.090
 need to be very careful not to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.799
 damage the delicate roots and scribes face 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.140
 stem multiplied 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.569
 and leaf cuttings they usually 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 take root during the week the most 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.970
 simple way of rooting lateral 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.830
 shoots developed shoots with three to four 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.010
 nodes without their own lateral processes 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.920
 put water immersing no more than 34 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.459
 centimeter can prikopat escape ground 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.590
 not separating it from the mother plant 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.459
 for today everything was with you lyudmila chko
