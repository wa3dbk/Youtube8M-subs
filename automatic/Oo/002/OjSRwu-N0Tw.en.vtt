then you know this these we have sins
now<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.660> only<00:02:39.960> problem<00:02:40.290> about<00:02:40.890> these<00:02:41.220> I'd<00:02:42.090> say

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
now the only problem about these I'd say

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.970 
now the only problem about these I'd say
is<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.030> don't<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:46.140> shoes<00:02:46.680> on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
is that if you don't have shoes on

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.470 
is that if you don't have shoes on
pretties<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.740> they<00:02:49.740> will<00:02:50.100> like<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.400> rotate<00:02:50.880> if

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
pretties and they will like to rotate if

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.080 
pretties and they will like to rotate if
they're<00:02:51.750> loose<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.220> while<00:02:53.490> you're<00:02:53.670> look

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
they're loose so while you're look

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.870 
they're loose so while you're look
rocking<00:02:54.510> around<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:55.200> going<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.880> become

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
rocking around it's going to become

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360 
rocking around it's going to become
loose<00:02:57.240> from<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.350> put<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.650> shoes<00:02:59.010> and
