use<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.920> Alpine<00:00:25.220> equalizer<00:00:25.700> so<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.810> Alpine

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
use the Alpine equalizer so the Alpine

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.839 
use the Alpine equalizer so the Alpine
equalizer<00:00:27.619> was<00:00:27.920> invented<00:00:28.340> by<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> guy<00:00:28.550> named

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
equalizer was invented by a guy named

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.300 
equalizer was invented by a guy named
Jim<00:00:29.119> Cormier<00:00:29.689> his<00:00:30.349> version<00:00:30.619> was<00:00:30.830> made<00:00:31.099> with

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
Jim Cormier his version was made with

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.790 
Jim Cormier his version was made with
one<00:00:31.460> inch<00:00:31.640> nylon<00:00:31.880> tube<00:00:32.119> Euler<00:00:32.570> webbing<00:00:32.989> wrap

one inch nylon tube Euler webbing wrap

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.490 
one inch nylon tube Euler webbing wrap
rings<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.550> heavy<00:00:34.760> stuff<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.540> we

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
rings and a heavy stuff like that we

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.410 
rings and a heavy stuff like that we
took<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.800> idea<00:00:36.829> from<00:00:37.160> him<00:00:37.520> made<00:00:37.970> it<00:00:38.120> out<00:00:38.239> of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
took the idea from him made it out of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.049 
took the idea from him made it out of
ultra<00:00:39.350> tape<00:00:39.530> Dyneema<00:00:39.980> made<00:00:40.730> our<00:00:40.880> own<00:00:40.910> little

ultra tape Dyneema made our own little

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.880 
ultra tape Dyneema made our own little
rings<00:00:41.540> for<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.170> called<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.559> Alpine

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
rings for it and called it the Alpine

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.500 
rings for it and called it the Alpine
equalizer<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.640> let<00:00:46.790> me<00:00:46.850> show<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:47.059> how<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.270> use

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
equalizer so let me show you how to use

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.630 
equalizer so let me show you how to use
it<00:00:47.690> but<00:00:47.899> first<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.379> word<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:48.710> warning<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:49.460> is

techniques in a safe location on the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.360 
techniques in a safe location on the
ground<00:01:02.480> before<00:01:03.289> you<00:01:03.379> go<00:01:03.559> out<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.010> hang<00:01:04.190> your

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
ground before you go out and hang your

ground before you go out and hang your
life<00:01:04.550> on<00:01:04.760> them<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.860> just<00:01:07.040> can't<00:01:07.310> find

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
life on them so if you just can't find

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.190 
life on them so if you just can't find
bomber<00:01:07.909> anchors<00:01:08.420> that's<00:01:08.659> when<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:08.960> time<00:01:09.020> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
bomber anchors that's when it's time to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.100 
bomber anchors that's when it's time to
think<00:01:09.440> about<00:01:09.530> equalization<00:01:10.990> equalization<00:01:11.990> is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
think about equalization equalization is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.920 
think about equalization equalization is
the<00:01:12.230> process<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.830> distributing<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.610> load

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the process of distributing the load

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.990 
the process of distributing the load
over<00:01:14.930> two<00:01:15.200> or<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.590> anchors<00:01:16.070> that's<00:01:16.790> where

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
over two or more anchors that's where

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.640 
over two or more anchors that's where
the<00:01:17.090> Alpine<00:01:17.390> equalizer<00:01:17.840> can<00:01:17.990> come<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.470> and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the Alpine equalizer can come in and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.580 
the Alpine equalizer can come in and
really<00:01:18.680> help<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.159> out<00:01:19.870> so<00:01:20.870> here<00:01:21.110> we<00:01:21.230> are<00:01:21.260> at<00:01:21.500> a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
really help you out so here we are at a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.080 
really help you out so here we are at a
place<00:01:21.680> we<00:01:21.950> want<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.190> set<00:01:22.340> up<00:01:22.370> an<00:01:22.580> anchor<00:01:22.880> we've

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
place we want to set up an anchor we've

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.450 
place we want to set up an anchor we've
got<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.330> nice<00:01:23.600> horizontal<00:01:23.990> crack<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.830> really

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
got a nice horizontal crack in really

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.390 
got a nice horizontal crack in really
solid<00:01:25.970> good<00:01:26.210> granite<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.710> only<00:01:27.950> reason<00:01:28.280> we'd

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
solid good granite the only reason we'd

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.040 
solid good granite the only reason we'd
want<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.670> equalize<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.300> really<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.690> because

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
want to equalize this really is because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.140 
want to equalize this really is because
these<00:01:30.260> anchors<00:01:31.010> on<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.190> side<00:01:31.460> are<00:01:31.730> really<00:01:31.940> set

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
these anchors on the side are really set

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.570 
these anchors on the side are really set
up<00:01:32.270> more<00:01:32.450> for<00:01:32.780> horizontal<00:01:33.740> pulls<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.400> we'll

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
up more for horizontal pulls so we'll

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.940 
up more for horizontal pulls so we'll
bring<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.420> everything<00:01:35.780> together<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.440> master

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
bring in everything together to a master

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.370 
bring in everything together to a master
point<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.430> make<00:01:38.330> sure<00:01:38.480> all<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.960> all<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
point and make sure all that all the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.150 
point and make sure all that all the
nuts<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:39.830> cams<00:01:40.310> are<00:01:40.550> really<00:01:40.760> stable<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.360> there

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
nuts and cams are really stable in there

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.140 
nuts and cams are really stable in there
so<00:01:43.160> we're<00:01:43.280> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> put<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.700> three<00:01:43.940> anchors

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
so we're going to put in three anchors

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.680 
so we're going to put in three anchors
here<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:46.100> think<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.090> guy<00:01:47.270> he'll<00:01:47.420> fit<00:01:47.660> in

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
here and I think that guy he'll fit in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:56.800 
here and I think that guy he'll fit in
over<00:01:48.110> here<00:01:48.560> sure<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:55.240> check<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.390> out<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.540> think

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
over here sure and check it out I think

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.070 
over here sure and check it out I think
we<00:01:56.900> got<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.050> nice<00:01:57.410> max<00:01:57.830> cam<00:01:58.220> location<00:01:59.080> right

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
we got a nice max cam location right

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.620 
we got a nice max cam location right
here<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.920> good<00:02:04.190> yeah<00:02:04.700> that's<00:02:04.970> good

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.350 

and<00:02:08.630> then<00:02:08.990> we'll<00:02:09.229> put<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.819> try<00:02:10.819> cam<00:02:11.120> in

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then we'll put a little try cam in

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:25.000 
and then we'll put a little try cam in
right<00:02:11.540> over<00:02:11.810> here<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.040> good

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.120 

take<00:02:25.640> your<00:02:25.849> equalizer

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.890 

I'm<00:02:30.670> tired

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.330 

and<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.049> see<00:02:39.290> you've<00:02:39.560> got<00:02:39.739> three<00:02:40.250> arms<00:02:41.109> here

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and you see you've got three arms here

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.050 
and you see you've got three arms here
where<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.640> rig<00:02:43.879> it<00:02:43.909> so<00:02:47.200> clip<00:02:48.200> one<00:02:48.409> here<00:02:49.060> one

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
where we can rig it so clip one here one

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.699 
where we can rig it so clip one here one
here<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:52.129> one<00:02:52.370> here<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.359> go<00:02:56.420> now<00:02:57.379> see

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
here and one here there you go now see

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.009 
here and one here there you go now see
how<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:57.950> automatically<00:02:58.519> equalizes<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.390> when

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
how it automatically equalizes it when

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.610 
how it automatically equalizes it when
we<00:03:00.170> move<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:01.519> dynamically<00:03:02.120> equalizes<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.470> no

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
we move it dynamically equalizes so no

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.860 
we move it dynamically equalizes so no
matter<00:03:03.799> where<00:03:04.069> we're<00:03:04.340> standing<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:05.659> get

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
matter where we're standing we get

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.119 
matter where we're standing we get
fairly<00:03:06.319> even<00:03:06.829> pull<00:03:07.069> on<00:03:07.730> all<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.150> these<00:03:08.299> anchors

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
fairly even pull on all of these anchors

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.869 
fairly even pull on all of these anchors
you<00:03:10.129> see<00:03:10.280> how<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.459> works<00:03:10.689> like<00:03:11.689> that<00:03:12.760> clip<00:03:13.760> it

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
you see how that works like that clip it

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.420 
you see how that works like that clip it
into<00:03:14.090> your<00:03:14.209> rope<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:14.599> you're<00:03:14.689> ready<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.049> go

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
into your rope and you're ready to go

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.210 
into your rope and you're ready to go
where<00:03:16.430> are<00:03:16.579> you<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:17.000> don't<00:03:17.989> think<00:03:18.349> so<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.799> think

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
where are you I don't think so I think

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.170 
where are you I don't think so I think
we<00:03:19.489> want<00:03:19.669> to<00:03:20.079> make<00:03:21.079> this<00:03:21.230> multi-directional

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
we want to make this multi-directional

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.909 
we want to make this multi-directional
why<00:03:23.180> not<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.720> somebody's<00:03:24.260> leading<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.650> next

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
why not if somebody's leading the next

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.830 
why not if somebody's leading the next
pitch<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.340> takes<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.700> boomer<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.659> don't

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
pitch and takes that boomer you don't

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.360 
pitch and takes that boomer you don't
want<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.049> be<00:03:27.109> yanked<00:03:27.439> six<00:03:27.680> feet<00:03:27.859> up<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.220> air

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
want to be yanked six feet up in the air

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.830 
want to be yanked six feet up in the air
you<00:03:28.579> might<00:03:28.700> hit<00:03:28.879> your<00:03:29.030> head<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.329> rock<00:03:29.599> you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
you might hit your head on the rock you

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.569 
you might hit your head on the rock you
might<00:03:29.870> break<00:03:30.200> your<00:03:30.260> hand<00:03:30.650> all<00:03:31.040> these<00:03:31.400> have

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
might break your hand all these have

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.659 
might break your hand all these have
happened<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.569> we're<00:03:32.750> looking<00:03:32.989> for<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.200> little

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
happened so we're looking for a little

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:39.789 
happened so we're looking for a little
place<00:03:34.669> down<00:03:34.700> there<00:03:36.280> we've<00:03:37.280> got<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.930> nice<00:03:38.930> pod<00:03:39.379> we

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
place down there we've got a nice pod we

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.360 
place down there we've got a nice pod we
can<00:03:39.950> get<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.209> big<00:03:41.209> nut<00:03:41.540> in

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.100 

that<00:03:48.370> won't<00:03:48.580> quite<00:03:48.879> go<00:03:49.090> directly<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:49.930> why

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
that won't quite go directly so why

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.680 
that won't quite go directly so why
don't<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:52.799> clip<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:57.510> we've<00:03:58.510> got

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
don't we clip in there so now we've got

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.160 
don't we clip in there so now we've got
an<00:03:58.810> anchor<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.890> will<00:04:00.040> prevent<00:04:00.310> us<00:04:00.489> from

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
an anchor that will prevent us from

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.869 
an anchor that will prevent us from
being<00:04:02.170> yank<00:04:02.470> anywhere<00:04:02.920> we<00:04:03.099> can<00:04:03.250> tie<00:04:03.459> right<00:04:03.670> in

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
being yank anywhere we can tie right in

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.270 
being yank anywhere we can tie right in
there<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.239> we've<00:04:04.360> got<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> good<00:04:04.750> system<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.409> lot

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
there and we've got a good system a lot

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.890 
there and we've got a good system a lot
of<00:04:06.310> people<00:04:06.610> wonder<00:04:06.879> if<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.060> Alpine<00:04:07.390> equalizer

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
of people wonder if the Alpine equalizer

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.050 
of people wonder if the Alpine equalizer
can<00:04:08.200> conform<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.799> serene<00:04:09.129> standards<00:04:09.760> of

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
can conform to serene standards of

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.119 
can conform to serene standards of
course<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.480> can<00:04:10.690> if<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.349> want<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.650> secured

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
course it can if you want it secured

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.000 
course it can if you want it secured
equalized<00:04:13.120> not<00:04:13.810> extending<00:04:14.379> and<00:04:14.500> redundant

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
equalized not extending and redundant

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.170 
equalized not extending and redundant
here's<00:04:15.489> all<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.730> have<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.970> do<00:04:16.090> at<00:04:16.810> each<00:04:17.019> point

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
here's all you have to do at each point

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:40.940 
here's all you have to do at each point
tie<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> clove<00:04:19.479> hitch

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.270 

there<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.730> go<00:04:41.850> okay<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:43.650> we've<00:04:43.830> got<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:44.010> fully

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
there you go okay now we've got a fully

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.570 
there you go okay now we've got a fully
serene<00:04:44.700> anchor<00:04:45.800> alright<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:47.220> those<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.490> you

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
serene anchor alright for those of you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.460 
serene anchor alright for those of you
naysayers<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.210> think<00:04:48.480> clove<00:04:48.930> hitches<00:04:49.170> won't

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
naysayers I think clove hitches won't

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.040 
naysayers I think clove hitches won't
hold<00:04:49.680> when<00:04:50.400> we<00:04:50.520> pull<00:04:50.760> tests<00:04:51.060> these<00:04:51.300> tie<00:04:52.020> a

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
hold when we pull tests these tie a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.900 
hold when we pull tests these tie a
clove<00:04:52.320> hitch<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.770> carabiner<00:04:53.160> pull<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.730> or

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
clove hitch and a carabiner pull one or

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.970 
clove hitch and a carabiner pull one or
the<00:04:54.000> other<00:04:54.150> strand<00:04:54.570> we<00:04:55.290> usually<00:04:55.620> break<00:04:55.800> the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
the other strand we usually break the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.080 
the other strand we usually break the
carabiners<00:04:58.010> so<00:04:59.010> this<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> pretty<00:04:59.550> perfect

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
carabiners so this is a pretty perfect

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.150 
carabiners so this is a pretty perfect
setup<00:05:00.510> we've<00:05:00.810> got<00:05:00.960> three<00:05:01.230> good<00:05:01.440> anchors<00:05:01.830> close

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
setup we've got three good anchors close

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.800 
setup we've got three good anchors close
to<00:05:02.310> each<00:05:02.460> other<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:03.090> course<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.450> could<00:05:03.600> be<00:05:03.720> an

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
to each other of course it could be an

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.960 
to each other of course it could be an
in<00:05:03.930> vertical<00:05:04.440> alignment<00:05:04.950> as<00:05:05.040> well<00:05:05.070> but<00:05:05.850> what

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
in vertical alignment as well but what

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.610 
in vertical alignment as well but what
happens<00:05:06.270> if<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.480> only<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.840> places<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.290> too

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
happens if you only have places for too

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.920 
happens if you only have places for too
close<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.430> then<00:05:08.520> another<00:05:08.730> one's<00:05:09.000> maybe<00:05:09.750> up

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
close and then another one's maybe up

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.930 
close and then another one's maybe up
there<00:05:10.200> well<00:05:11.100> there's<00:05:11.280> no<00:05:11.400> problem<00:05:11.760> at<00:05:11.820> all

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
there well there's no problem at all

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.800 
there well there's no problem at all
with<00:05:12.120> extending<00:05:12.750> these<00:05:12.990> with<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.830> runner<00:05:14.130> so

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
with extending these with a runner so
