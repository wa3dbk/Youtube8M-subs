00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.160
 hi this is the video site team 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.219
 test.com today the bar test 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 thick myprotein mania 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.080
 call and diamond simply the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.299
 manuscripts aps 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 so basically the clips I have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.300
 discovered thanks to mickaÃ«l 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
 gundy has moreover you will find 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.220
 videos on videotron.com where you see 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 who can compare two little lifestyles 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 different but proteins in offer 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.980
 so what is it really 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.689
 it's an accessory that will suit you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 to increase the diameter of your 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 bars so that's why increase the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.079
 diameter and a bar because 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 really to go to the basics 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.070
 allows you to gain strength from 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 solicit a little better muscle than 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 you help work and distributions 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 a little more uniform at the level of the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.629
 grip prevention is missing so that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.989
 it's interesting because like that you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.610
 just going to gain strength and that's it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 before his assets and interests to have this 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 accessory that is really becoming 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 more popular and precisely I wanted 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 a little bit to test it myself what we 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.949
 can say on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.700
 well that's obviously sold per person 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.420
 with a total weight of 560 g 13 cm in length 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.369
 and 5.6 cm in diameter you can 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.860
 obviously go beyond this one can 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.409
 discard very easily so that's it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.939
 it's interesting 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.400
 then also appreciate the side 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.799
 you have the scriptures so to locate at 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 that level and not at the level of the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.430
 pretty nice entry and again 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.340
 I am referring to the guild video 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
 it since after a while when 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 these scriptures are located at this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 level there we can hurt you to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.930
 bottom level so I wanted to test 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.509
 this on different exercises so in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.649
 link with biceps and triceps but 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.240
 also with the pectorals 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.530
 so we're going to see a little bit of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.000
 my room what it gives 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.280
 so to put it up is very 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.049
 simple so just take this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.880
 accessory to spread it and that's it and so 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.439
 then there is more to grab is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.689
 actually one compared to a bar 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.740
 classical 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:10.530
 see the seizure so it's not necessarily 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.560
 how would I say uniform while there 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.920
 with a slightly enlarged diameter is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.349
 see inside it's the catch will be that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.599
 better then at the base level that 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.739
 is easily felt 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.080
 actually you pushed a little 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.950
 heavier so that's it so I'm going to you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.690
 also show on others 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.849
 accessories 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.940
 so that's not even the dumbbells for 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.360
 work the biceps for example that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.830
 fits very well then after there 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:49.530
 see the seizure and no worries so we 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:53.910
 can work nickel and immediately 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 feel that the business this job what good 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.319
 so here I used to bicep 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 and triceps 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.560
 so for all that is laughable is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 especially in the bench press 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.810
 so it happens to me is one thing he 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.860
 so you have to be careful 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.030
 it's that when you start to 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.620
 work alone 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.920
 especially on a single machine like the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.590
 mine I remind you at the six 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.299
 machines so here you have assystem 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.230
 so the nursery 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.630
 when you are alone and then just 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 to switch to put your bar 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.790
 good the problem is that when you 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.910
 are alone then and you start to 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 carry heavy and want to rest 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.459
 your bar of 3 and well when it's 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.450
 too heavy 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.760
 in fact the claws can have 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.410
 tendency to turn as well as when 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.329
 I wanted to put back my clip shot in 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.700
 the wind and I could not get my 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.739
 again, thankfully only by the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 next we have a system here of protection 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.630
 I was able to rest quietly barr 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.459
 but watch out if you're rocking alone and 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.350
 more if you were not asked if you 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.600
 think a free hand is super 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.430
 blunder it can turn and so that 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.139
 can be quite dangerous in small 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.569
 accuracy actually I realized 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.810
 account that are uncertain the a6 in 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.459
 does one explain that when one does 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.930
 enlarge the bar the diameter of the bar 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.359
 we will gain some strength 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
 ok but that's not necessarily true for 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.560
 all the accessories which will not be 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.370
 necessarily will not go the same ratio of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.650
 gaza 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.690
 you practiced me for me 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.669
 when you practice the tug I have that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.410
 annoys me more than anything else taking in 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.169
 charge like that so after to you of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.910
 see to you to test the so a little 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.840
 demonstration 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 see it's not necessarily top 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.040
 according to what you want to practice as 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.040
 racist 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.530
 so we saw this axis interesting 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.170
 the strengths of this product 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.780
 actually it's a strength gain a 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.660
 better grip and better 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 feeling for the muscle working 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.090
 then on the other hand negative points 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.390
 in telling them so that's the fact that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.290
 his chip that it just moves the 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.670
 crimes are not are not tight if 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.370
 you use quite heavy departure in 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.960
 does the league and not tend to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.520
 turn so it can be dangerous if 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 you work alone so this problem 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.660
 can be solved by working with a 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.840
 partner for example 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.360
 so be careful in my opinion 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.860
 honestly it's finally I 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.780
 knew a little bit about this system 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.110
 there so I had not tested in Corsica 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.310
 myprotein is actually pretty 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.110
 undeniable is if you really want 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.170
 have a real sensation and and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.830
 work a little better at your level 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.350
 plugs etc 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.870
 really have to go on for 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.550
 buy it is pretty night after 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.580
 I hope that myprotein would find a 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.950
 solution why not create a species 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.730
 of opening here and there and with a 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.890
 system of 200 to blush with a system of 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.020
 lock that we can tighten a 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.340
 little more this grip so that when 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.380
 I work alone I can not 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:07.020
 turn to see that it's really at a 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.730
 frankly nice accessory but who 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.200
 asks a little more than 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.230
 perfection so here 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.210
 so here is really then against 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.000
 since you have clearly stated that it is 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.400
 that it's up to you to see next 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.500
 the exercises we count on sion if 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.390
 will really have a good or not it's at 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.290
 say that for example me all that is 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.540
 cultural etc 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:35.420
 there's no problem I feel great 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:38.420
 here are however the Americans there by 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.190
 against I limit meant better for me 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.800
 so it depends after only people 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.390
 but we can not rely not want and 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.340
 if we do not want to say that to the prince 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.560
 accessories we are going to win the 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.500
 strength for all the exercises it's not 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.390
 true it depends on the feelings each and 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.460
 it depends also on them if I think about 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.230
 have it right for you to tell me ah if 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.570
 you have tested these accessories there if 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.030
 you felt effects on everyone 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.440
 exercises or not or where to give 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.640
 me your opinion bah I tell you to very 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.690
 soon on video was this to the point 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.960
 as for other tests 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.960
 Hi
