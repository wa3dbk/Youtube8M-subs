00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.800 
pump that works off the vacuum of the
engine<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> build<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.200> own

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:15.809 

you

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:26.970 

you

you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.730 

put<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.580> air<00:04:24.669> cleaner<00:04:24.940> back<00:04:25.180> on<00:04:25.740> that's

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
put the air cleaner back on that's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.080 
put the air cleaner back on that's
really<00:04:26.979> how<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.280> should<00:04:27.610> do<00:04:27.699> your<00:04:27.880> final

way to the right until it just seats and
in<00:04:56.889> this<00:04:56.979> case<00:04:57.250> this<00:04:57.430> has<00:04:57.580> backed<00:04:57.819> out<00:04:58.030> to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
in this case this has backed out to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.260 
in this case this has backed out to
complete<00:04:58.780> exact<00:04:59.349> turns<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.729> then<00:05:00.909> under<00:05:01.150> the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
complete exact turns and then under the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.320 
complete exact turns and then under the
fuel<00:05:01.509> pump<00:05:01.780> here<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.830> have<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:04.300> idle<00:05:04.990> screw

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
fuel pump here you have the idle screw

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.909 
fuel pump here you have the idle screw
same<00:05:07.330> deal<00:05:07.569> here<00:05:07.599> righty<00:05:08.199> tighty<00:05:08.440> till<00:05:08.830> you

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
same deal here righty tighty till you

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.339 
same deal here righty tighty till you
just<00:05:09.159> gently<00:05:09.370> seat<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.569> one<00:05:10.810> tuned<00:05:11.110> out

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
just gently seat it this one tuned out

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.159 
just gently seat it this one tuned out
at<00:05:11.650> one<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:12.069> a<00:05:12.130> quarter<00:05:12.520> turns<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.840> it's<00:05:13.960> one

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
at one and a quarter turns so it's one

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.779 
at one and a quarter turns so it's one
full<00:05:14.409> revolution<00:05:14.590> plus<00:05:15.190> another<00:05:15.430> quarter

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
full revolution plus another quarter

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.330 
full revolution plus another quarter
turn<00:05:15.819> out<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.479> then<00:05:17.319> you<00:05:17.409> do<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.650> final<00:05:17.919> idle

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
turn out and then you do the final idle

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.700 
turn out and then you do the final idle
