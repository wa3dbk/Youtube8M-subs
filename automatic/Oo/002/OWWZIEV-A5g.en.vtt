series arsenal of lenses well that's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.609 
series arsenal of lenses well that's
true<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:28.850> typically<00:00:29.480> panasonic<00:00:30.260> makes<00:00:30.440> its

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
true but typically panasonic makes its

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.799 
true but typically panasonic makes its
lenses<00:00:31.039> with<00:00:31.279> leica<00:00:31.730> these<00:00:32.359> ones<00:00:32.629> however

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
lenses with leica these ones however

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.260 
lenses with leica these ones however
have<00:00:33.199> been<00:00:33.379> built<00:00:33.649> entirely<00:00:34.250> in-house<00:00:34.970> and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
have been built entirely in-house and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.389 
have been built entirely in-house and
Panasonic's<00:00:36.050> say<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.440> there<00:00:36.649> are<00:00:36.800> premium

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
Panasonic's say that there are premium

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.670 
Panasonic's say that there are premium
lenses<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.420> they've<00:00:38.570> been<00:00:38.690> given<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.079> x<00:00:39.290> name

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
lenses and they've been given the x name

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.790 
lenses and they've been given the x name
so<00:00:39.920> these<00:00:40.040> are<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.250> lumix<00:00:40.700> g<00:00:41.120> x<00:00:41.450> lenses<00:00:42.260> so

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
so these are the lumix g x lenses so

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.889 
so these are the lumix g x lenses so
first<00:00:43.070> i<00:00:43.250> will<00:00:43.399> have<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.550> quick<00:00:43.850> look<00:00:43.880> at<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.420> 14

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
first i will have a quick look at the 14

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.130 
first i will have a quick look at the 14
to<00:00:45.350> 42<00:00:45.920> millimeter<00:00:46.399> lens<00:00:46.579> now<00:00:47.059> at<00:00:47.870> first

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
to 42 millimeter lens now at first

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.959 
to 42 millimeter lens now at first
glance<00:00:48.380> this<00:00:48.649> might<00:00:48.829> look<00:00:49.040> like<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.309> 20<00:00:49.730> mil

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
glance this might look like a 20 mil

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.270 
glance this might look like a 20 mil
pancake<00:00:50.570> lens<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.530> because<00:00:51.739> it's<00:00:52.160> a

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
pancake lens and that's because it's a

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520 
pancake lens and that's because it's a
collapsible<00:00:52.969> lens<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:53.870> can<00:00:53.989> see<00:00:54.230> if<00:00:54.469> we

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
collapsible lens so we can see if we

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.069 
collapsible lens so we can see if we
switch<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.790> it<00:00:56.480> pops<00:00:56.719> out<00:00:56.899> at

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
switch it on here that it pops out at

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.709 
switch it on here that it pops out at
the<00:00:57.170> front<00:00:57.440> there's<00:00:58.160> also<00:00:58.399> zoom<00:00:59.000> control<00:00:59.510> on

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
the front there's also zoom control on

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.260 
the front there's also zoom control on
the<00:01:00.079> lens<00:01:00.230> barrel<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.829> focus<00:01:01.579> control<00:01:01.879> too

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
the lens barrel and focus control too

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.090 
the lens barrel and focus control too
now<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:02.600> zoom<00:01:02.960> control<00:01:03.350> is<00:01:03.500> particularly

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
now that zoom control is particularly

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.760 
now that zoom control is particularly
handy<00:01:04.670> when<00:01:05.059> you're<00:01:05.210> shooting<00:01:05.360> video<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.740> now

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
handy when you're shooting video so now

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.210 
handy when you're shooting video so now
we'll<00:01:07.010> look<00:01:07.130> at<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.460> 45<00:01:08.360> 2<00:01:08.600> 1<00:01:08.780> 75<00:01:09.320> millimeter

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
we'll look at the 45 2 1 75 millimeter

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.390 
we'll look at the 45 2 1 75 millimeter
lens<00:01:10.700> this<00:01:11.659> has<00:01:11.780> also<00:01:12.080> got<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.619> zoom<00:01:12.860> control

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700 
lens this has also got the zoom control
on<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.270> lens<00:01:14.479> barrel<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.110> there's<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.500> lever

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
on the lens barrel and there's the lever

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.160 
on the lens barrel and there's the lever
here<00:01:16.130> or<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.760> can<00:01:16.970> turn<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.450> ring<00:01:17.659> as<00:01:17.869> you
