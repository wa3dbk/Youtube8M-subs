think
nights<00:00:38.380> to<00:00:39.010> take<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.160> look<00:00:39.430> inside<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:41.110> nice

finishes<00:00:41.740> going<00:00:42.040> on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.820 

see<00:00:45.060> if<00:00:45.150> I<00:00:45.240> can<00:00:45.360> grab<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.690> opportunity<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.560> take

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
see if I can grab an opportunity to take

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.470 
see if I can grab an opportunity to take
a<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> interior<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.150> a<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.360> more

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a look at the interior in a bit more

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.290 
a look at the interior in a bit more
detail<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.790> see<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.910> entire<00:00:51.240> car<00:00:51.600> here

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130

follow<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.420> due<00:01:04.660> course

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
follow in due course

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.429 
follow in due course
