00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
first thing with the meat is you need to

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.900 
first thing with the meat is you need to
pay<00:00:46.710> attention<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.280> where<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:47.520> grain<00:00:47.880> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
pay attention to where the grain is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.700 
pay attention to where the grain is
running<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.290> select<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
running and you also want to select the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.640 
running and you also want to select the
piece<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.880> some<00:00:51.570> marbling<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.260> some

piece that has some marbling and some
connective<00:00:53.070> tissue<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> pick<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
connective tissue and if you pick a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.530 
connective tissue and if you pick a
piece<00:00:54.450> that's<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.200> solid<00:00:55.740> red<00:00:56.070> meat

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
piece that's just like solid red meat

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.270 
piece that's just like solid red meat
you're<00:00:57.540> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.720> be<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.500> tough

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you're going to be in from one tough

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.840 
you're going to be in from one tough
stringy<00:00:59.730> final<00:01:00.480> dish<00:01:00.720> now<00:01:01.640> you're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.790> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
stringy final dish now you're going to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
stringy final dish now you're going to
want<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.030> cut<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.810> pieces<00:01:04.079> in<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.680> direction

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
want to cut the pieces in this direction

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
want to cut the pieces in this direction
so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> short<00:01:05.909> grains<00:01:06.210> running<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so you have short grains running the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190 
so you have short grains running the
length<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:08.509> often<00:01:09.509> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> case

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
length but also often is the case

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.780 
length but also often is the case
especially<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.740> Russia<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> band

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
especially in Russia you got this band

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.910 
especially in Russia you got this band
here<00:01:12.120> it's<00:01:12.240> clearly<00:01:12.570> visible<00:01:12.900> band<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> tissue

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
here it's clearly visible band of tissue

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
here it's clearly visible band of tissue
that<00:01:14.760> runs<00:01:15.030> around<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.050> I'm<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that runs around here so I'm going to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.110 
that runs around here so I'm going to

bit of salt on the other side it's not

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.899 
bit of salt on the other side it's not
too<00:01:55.259> critical<00:01:57.680> in<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.800> case<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.220> using<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
too critical in this case I'm using the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.660 
too critical in this case I'm using the

now<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.729> measured<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.600> infrared

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
now just measured it with an infrared

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.920 
now just measured it with an infrared
thermometer<00:02:10.880> anding<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.180> olive<00:02:12.510> oil<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
thermometer anding a little olive oil to

thermometer anding a little olive oil to
this<00:02:13.110> couple<00:02:13.860> tablespoons<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.330> I'm<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
this couple tablespoons and I'm going to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.470 
this couple tablespoons and I'm going to
begin<00:02:16.590> searing<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.250> means<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.880> it's<00:02:18.150> got<00:02:18.330> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
begin searing this means all it's got on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.080 
begin searing this means all it's got on
it<00:02:18.570> right<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.560> coarse<00:02:19.830> whole<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.430> I'm

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
it right now is the coarse whole and I'm

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.729 
it right now is the coarse whole and I'm
doing<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.570> two<00:02:22.050> batches<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:27.410> have<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.590> heat

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
doing it in two batches I have the heat

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.190 
doing it in two batches I have the heat
up<00:02:28.950> fairly<00:02:29.310> high<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:29.880> almost<00:02:30.569> eight<00:02:30.840> that's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
up fairly high it's almost eight that's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
up fairly high it's almost eight that's
seven<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.860> order<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.459> if<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.910> try<00:02:33.120> to

seven of the order and if you try to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.970 
seven of the order and if you try to

move the meat and it's stuck to the pans

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.530 
move the meat and it's stuck to the pans
means<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:35.819> done<00:02:36.120> yet
