to do too soft or too runny because it

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.520 
to do too soft or too runny because it
won't<00:07:06.100> be<00:07:06.220> thick<00:07:07.120> enough<00:07:07.150> to<00:07:07.540> do<00:07:07.690> all<00:07:08.350> right

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.380 
sure we get all of it okay we're gonna
whisk<00:07:23.350> that<00:07:23.470> in<00:07:23.650> a<00:07:23.680> little<00:07:23.860> bit

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
whisk that in a little bit

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.420 
whisk that in a little bit
this<00:07:25.390> will<00:07:25.540> help<00:07:25.660> thicken<00:07:25.810> our<00:07:26.020> soup

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
this will help thicken our soup

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.410 
this will help thicken our soup
generally<00:07:27.430> a<00:07:27.460> clam<00:07:27.850> chowder<00:07:28.120> is<00:07:28.240> a<00:07:28.270> little

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
generally a clam chowder is a little

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.080 
generally a clam chowder is a little
thicker<00:07:28.630> than<00:07:28.750> this<00:07:28.990> but<00:07:29.260> given<00:07:30.130> our<00:07:30.310> the<00:07:31.060> way

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
thicker than this but given our the way

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.250 
thicker than this but given our the way
we're<00:07:31.360> making<00:07:31.450> it<00:07:31.690> today<00:07:31.810> our<00:07:32.020> mashed

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
we're making it today our mashed

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.480 
we're making it today our mashed
potatoes<00:07:32.680> we're<00:07:32.800> gonna<00:07:32.890> add<00:07:33.130> into<00:07:33.370> the<00:07:33.460> bowl

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
potatoes we're gonna add into the bowl

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.970 
potatoes we're gonna add into the bowl
will<00:07:34.090> help<00:07:34.240> thicken<00:07:34.420> the<00:07:34.600> soup<00:07:34.750> as<00:07:34.930> well<00:07:34.980> okay

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
will help thicken the soup as well okay

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.290 
will help thicken the soup as well okay
now<00:07:36.190> it's<00:07:36.340> also<00:07:36.460> important<00:07:36.940> once<00:07:37.090> you<00:07:37.150> put

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
now it's also important once you put

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.120 
now it's also important once you put
your<00:07:37.330> ruin<00:07:37.750> to<00:07:37.900> lower<00:07:38.470> your<00:07:38.650> heat<00:07:38.860> to<00:07:38.980> a<00:07:39.010> simmer

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130 
your ruin to lower your heat to a simmer

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.450 
your ruin to lower your heat to a simmer
and<00:07:39.700> let<00:07:40.480> that<00:07:40.810> that<00:07:41.290> flour<00:07:41.680> kind<00:07:42.070> of<00:07:42.130> cook<00:07:42.280> out

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460 
and let that that flour kind of cook out

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.520 
and let that that flour kind of cook out
of<00:07:42.580> there<00:07:42.670> for<00:07:42.820> about<00:07:42.970> 15<00:07:43.450> to<00:07:43.540> 20<00:07:43.870> minutes<00:07:44.200> okay

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
of there for about 15 to 20 minutes okay

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.190 
of there for about 15 to 20 minutes okay
so<00:07:44.740> you<00:07:45.010> don't<00:07:45.100> get<00:07:45.250> that<00:07:45.600> chalky<00:07:46.600> taste<00:07:46.960> in

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.200 
so you don't get that chalky taste in

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.870 
so you don't get that chalky taste in
your<00:07:47.230> mouth<00:07:47.350> and<00:07:47.920> you<00:07:48.010> let<00:07:48.160> that<00:07:48.190> butter<00:07:48.580> just

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 
your mouth and you let that butter just

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.480 
your mouth and you let that butter just
melt<00:07:49.090> into<00:07:49.270> that<00:07:49.450> soup<00:07:49.720> and<00:07:49.930> just<00:07:50.340> make<00:07:51.340> it

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490 
melt into that soup and just make it

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.400 
melt into that soup and just make it
richer<00:07:51.730> than<00:07:51.880> it<00:07:51.970> already<00:07:52.090> was<00:07:52.300> and<00:07:52.870> once<00:07:53.230> it's

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.410 
richer than it already was and once it's

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.540 
richer than it already was and once it's
done<00:07:53.560> we'll<00:07:53.890> be<00:07:53.920> able<00:07:54.160> to<00:07:54.220> check<00:07:54.370> it<00:07:54.520> for

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.550 
done we'll be able to check it for

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.610 
done we'll be able to check it for
seasoning<00:07:54.820> and<00:07:55.270> taste<00:07:55.810> it<00:07:56.020> and<00:07:56.050> then<00:07:56.350> we'll<00:07:56.500> be

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.620 
seasoning and taste it and then we'll be

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.550 
seasoning and taste it and then we'll be
ready<00:07:56.740> to<00:07:57.010> assemble<00:07:57.400> the<00:07:57.580> soup<00:07:58.110> to<00:07:59.110> watch<00:07:59.290> the
