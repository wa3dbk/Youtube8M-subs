00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
pigmented you swatch like all of them I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.960 
pigmented you swatch like all of them I
think<00:02:59.930> my<00:03:00.170> camera<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.560> washing<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.160> but<00:03:01.700> in

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
think my camera is washing it out but in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.150 
think my camera is washing it out but in
real<00:03:02.150> life<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:02.690> looks<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:03.200> lot<00:03:03.500> more<00:03:03.560> pigmented

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
real life it looks a lot more pigmented

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.900 
real life it looks a lot more pigmented
and<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:05.120> doesn't<00:03:05.480> really<00:03:05.660> provide<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.850> glow<00:03:07.850> to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
and it doesn't really provide a glow to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.650 
and it doesn't really provide a glow to
your<00:03:08.240> skin

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
your skin

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.930 
your skin
I'm<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.710> glow<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.130> see<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.640> from<00:03:10.760> Mac

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
I'm the glow that you see is from Mac

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.330 
I'm the glow that you see is from Mac
soft<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.300> gentle<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.780> think<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.220> a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
soft and gentle I think it's more of a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.640 
soft and gentle I think it's more of a
satiny<00:03:13.850> finish<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.390> not<00:03:14.510> 100%<00:03:14.840> matte<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.470> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
satiny finish it's not 100% matte but it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.020 
satiny finish it's not 100% matte but it
definitely<00:03:16.070> isn't<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.420> um<00:03:18.520> glow<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.580> or

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
definitely isn't as um glow you or

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.030 
definitely isn't as um glow you or
shimmery<00:03:20.360> as<00:03:20.630> some<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.020> my<00:03:21.080> other<00:03:21.290> blushes<00:03:21.620> I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
shimmery as some of my other blushes I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.430 
shimmery as some of my other blushes I
think<00:03:22.460> natural<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.120> more<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.140> little<00:03:24.350> bit

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
think natural is more it's a little bit

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.950 
think natural is more it's a little bit
on<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> bag<00:03:24.800> each<00:03:24.950> side<00:03:25.280> for<00:03:26.210> me<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.930> my

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
on the bag each side for me I like my

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.400 
on the bag each side for me I like my
blush<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.530> be<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.300> chose<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.020> rose<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
blush to be like so I chose the rose and

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.780 
blush to be like so I chose the rose and
also<00:03:30.680> because<00:03:30.950> my<00:03:31.100> store<00:03:31.280> didn't<00:03:31.520> have<00:03:31.550> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
also because my store didn't have the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.520 
also because my store didn't have the
natural<00:03:32.210> one<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.200> think<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.610> is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
natural one and I think that this is

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.380 
natural one and I think that this is
really<00:03:36.530> nice<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.190> price<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.490> paid<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.000> left

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
or it doesn't make me red and it just

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.010 
or it doesn't make me red and it just
gives<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.780> really<00:04:53.470> nice<00:04:53.650> kind<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:55.020> really

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
gives a really nice kind of a really

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.900 
gives a really nice kind of a really
natural<00:04:56.260> tan<00:04:57.160> scent<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.730> effect<00:04:58.890> if<00:04:59.890> you<00:05:00.670> are

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
natural tan scent and effect if you are

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.530 
natural tan scent and effect if you are
darker<00:05:01.480> than<00:05:01.510> like<00:05:01.780> NC<00:05:02.880> 25<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.150> don't<00:05:04.330> think

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
darker than like NC 25 I don't think

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.860 
darker than like NC 25 I don't think
this<00:05:04.690> will<00:05:04.870> work<00:05:05.080> for<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.530> just<00:05:06.630> because<00:05:07.630> the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
this will work for you just because the

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.550 
this will work for you just because the
pigmentation<00:05:08.350> isn't<00:05:09.010> as<00:05:09.160> good<00:05:09.880> as<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.630> blush

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
pigmentation isn't as good as the blush

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.130 
pigmentation isn't as good as the blush
and<00:05:11.860> this<00:05:12.580> one<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:12.910> get<00:05:13.090> 11<00:05:13.480> grams<00:05:13.810> which

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
and this one you get 11 grams which

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.010 
and this one you get 11 grams which
again<00:05:14.640> it's<00:05:15.640> really<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.360> lot<00:05:16.690> more<00:05:16.720> bang<00:05:16.930> for

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
again it's really a lot more bang for

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.460 
again it's really a lot more bang for
your<00:05:17.140> buck<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.520> again<00:05:18.520> they<00:05:18.700> smell<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.470> mix
