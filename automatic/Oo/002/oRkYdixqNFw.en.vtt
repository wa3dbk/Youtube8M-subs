00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
themselves or blended together and would

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.419 
themselves or blended together and would
start<00:02:09.289> out<00:02:09.439> with<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.679> little<00:02:09.950> finger<00:02:10.219> stop

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
start out with a little finger stop

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.519 
start out with a little finger stop
playing<00:02:10.729> using<00:02:11.389> only<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.900> pies<00:02:12.109> or<00:02:12.319> pick<00:02:12.499> up

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:12.529 
playing using only the pies or pick up

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:13.860 
playing using only the pies or pick up
by<00:02:12.920> itself

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
by itself

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.470 
by itself
and<00:02:13.959> I've<00:02:14.110> got<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.349> EQ<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.159> board<00:02:15.430> pretty<00:02:16.299> much

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and I've got the EQ on board pretty much

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
and I've got the EQ on board pretty much
flat<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.170> guitar<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.799> can<00:02:17.950> really

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
flat on this guitar so you can really

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.160 
flat on this guitar so you can really
just<00:02:18.340> hear<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.030> pickup<00:02:19.420> played<00:02:19.870> through<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
just hear the pickup played through a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.680 
just hear the pickup played through a
little<00:02:20.409> Fishman<00:02:20.860> loud<00:02:21.010> box<00:02:21.310> 100<00:02:21.790> amp<00:02:22.120> that's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
little Fishman loud box 100 amp that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.750 
little Fishman loud box 100 amp that's
also<00:02:22.870> set<00:02:23.409> fairly<00:02:23.739> flat<00:02:23.980> I've<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.340> got<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
also set fairly flat I've just got a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:50.210 
also set fairly flat I've just got a
touch<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.150> reverb<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.930> this

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.040 

so<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.550> heard<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.090> under<00:02:52.390> saddle<00:02:52.600> pickup

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
so we just heard the under saddle pickup

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.110 
so we just heard the under saddle pickup
of<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> guitar<00:02:53.560> used<00:02:53.800> by<00:02:53.980> itself<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.880> has

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
of the guitar used by itself which has

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.210 
of the guitar used by itself which has
the<00:02:55.330> typical<00:02:55.480> fairly<00:02:56.140> bright<00:02:56.410> sound<00:02:56.770> that

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
the typical fairly bright sound that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.280 
the typical fairly bright sound that
that<00:02:58.030> kind<00:02:58.240> of<00:02:58.270> pick<00:02:58.450> up<00:02:58.540> usually<00:02:58.930> picks<00:02:59.140> up

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
that kind of pick up usually picks up

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.080 
that kind of pick up usually picks up
because<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.800> its<00:03:00.010> location<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.640> there<00:03:00.970> in

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
because of its location right there in

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.290 
because of its location right there in
the<00:03:01.120> saddle<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:02.319> magnetic<00:03:03.310> pickup<00:03:03.700> usually

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the saddle a magnetic pickup usually

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.270 
the saddle a magnetic pickup usually
offers<00:03:04.720> pretty<00:03:05.080> much<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.350> opposite<00:03:05.860> kind<00:03:06.190> of

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
offers pretty much the opposite kind of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.030 
offers pretty much the opposite kind of
a<00:03:06.370> sound<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:06.880> warm<00:03:07.270> sound<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:08.650> doesn't

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
a sound a very warm sound it doesn't

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040 
a sound a very warm sound it doesn't
have<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.250> snap<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.270> strings<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.900> an

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
have the snap of the strings that an

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.110 
have the snap of the strings that an
underside<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.440> pickup<00:03:11.800> tends<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.790> on

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
underside of pickup tends to get and on

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.460 
underside of pickup tends to get and on
this<00:03:13.209> particular<00:03:13.390> guitar<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.959> was<00:03:14.110> surprised

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
this particular guitar I was surprised

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.260 
this particular guitar I was surprised
how<00:03:14.739> much<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.190> could<00:03:15.340> almost<00:03:15.489> sound<00:03:15.850> like<00:03:15.970> an

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
how much it could almost sound like an

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.479 
how much it could almost sound like an
archtop<00:03:16.720> electric<00:03:17.260> guitar<00:03:17.530> something<00:03:18.190> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
archtop electric guitar something that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.890 
archtop electric guitar something that
you<00:03:18.580> would<00:03:18.730> use<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:18.910> playing<00:03:19.300> jazz<00:03:19.630> or

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
you would use for playing jazz or

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.540 
you would use for playing jazz or
something<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:20.500> right<00:03:20.770> now<00:03:20.800> I'm

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
something like that so right now I'm

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.180 
something like that so right now I'm
going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.820> demonstrate<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.780> lace<00:03:22.959> l<00:03:23.500> f-150s

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
going to demonstrate the lace l f-150s

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.780 
going to demonstrate the lace l f-150s
ee<00:03:24.519> using<00:03:24.940> only<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.480> magnetic<00:03:25.900> pickup<00:03:26.320> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
ee using only the magnetic pickup and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.690 
ee using only the magnetic pickup and
with<00:03:27.989> kind<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.140> warm<00:03:29.620> jazz<00:03:30.010> setting<00:03:30.459> even

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
with kind of a warm jazz setting even

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.130 
with kind of a warm jazz setting even
though<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.880> EQ<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.269> still<00:03:31.450> pretty<00:03:31.630> flat<00:03:31.989> I've

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
though the EQ is still pretty flat I've

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.870 
though the EQ is still pretty flat I've
just<00:03:32.320> added<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.680> tiny<00:03:33.130> little<00:03:33.190> bit<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.459> highest

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
just added a tiny little bit of highest

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.610 
just added a tiny little bit of highest
to<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.600> magnetic<00:03:34.900> pickup<00:03:35.319> on<00:03:35.500> the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
to the to the magnetic pickup on the

to the to the magnetic pickup on the
onboard<00:03:36.010> eq<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> now<00:03:47.650> we've<00:03:47.830> heard<00:03:48.069> only<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
onboard eq so now we've heard only the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.460 
onboard eq so now we've heard only the
underside<00:03:49.060> will<00:03:49.239> pick<00:03:49.390> up<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.080> magnetic

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
underside will pick up and the magnetic

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.650 
underside will pick up and the magnetic
pickup<00:03:50.860> by<00:03:51.100> themselves<00:03:51.580> I've<00:03:51.910> now<00:03:52.120> combined

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
pickup by themselves I've now combined

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.770 
pickup by themselves I've now combined
the<00:03:52.840> two<00:03:53.019> signals<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.010> F<00:03:54.239> adjusted<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.329> EQ<00:03:55.660> on

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
the two signals and F adjusted the EQ on

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.270 
the two signals and F adjusted the EQ on
the<00:03:55.870> guitar<00:03:56.079> just<00:03:56.320> slightly<00:03:56.620> boosting<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
the guitar just slightly boosting the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.400 
the guitar just slightly boosting the
base<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.090> underside<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> pick<00:03:59.079> up<00:03:59.200> a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
and demonstrate what the combined

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:16.470 
and demonstrate what the combined
sources<00:04:04.120> could<00:04:04.630> sound<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.320> an<00:04:05.530> example

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:27.330
