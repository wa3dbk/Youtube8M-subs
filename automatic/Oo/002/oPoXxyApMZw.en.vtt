00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.930 
can't see what we're you're brushing it
and<00:03:24.709> since<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.959> square<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.160> can't<00:03:29.459> see

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
and since it's square you can't see

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.449 
and since it's square you can't see
where<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.930> spa<00:03:31.769> suit<00:03:32.299> scrub<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.829> if<00:03:35.160> I

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
where your spa suit scrub to so if I

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.520 
where your spa suit scrub to so if I
will<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.910> cut<00:03:36.120> down<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.450> bottom<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.170> can't

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
will just cut down the bottom I can't

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.740 
will just cut down the bottom I can't
see<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:40.200> kind<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.769> hard<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.100> scrub

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
see that and it's kind of hard to scrub

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.979 
see that and it's kind of hard to scrub
toward<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:43.500> substrate<00:03:44.340> because<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:45.780> thing

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
toward your substrate because this thing

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.060 
toward your substrate because this thing
is<00:03:46.079> kind<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.350> difficult<00:03:48.440> I'm<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:49.650> sure<00:03:49.829> why

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
is kind of difficult I'm not sure why

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.220 
is kind of difficult I'm not sure why
they<00:03:50.280> could<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:50.610> make<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:51.299> whole<00:03:51.630> circle

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
they could just make it a whole circle

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.180 
they could just make it a whole circle
and<00:03:52.470> then<00:03:53.420> make<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.450> scrubber<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.799> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
and then make that scrubber so go to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.430 
and then make that scrubber so go to
several<00:03:56.880> square<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:58.370> don't<00:03:59.370> know<00:03:59.489> but<00:04:00.290> come<00:04:01.290> on

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
several square I don't know but come on

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.750 
several square I don't know but come on
it's<00:04:01.799> it's<00:04:02.160> okay

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
it's it's okay

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.449 
it's it's okay
one<00:04:03.030> thing<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.329> also<00:04:03.660> notice<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.400> if<00:04:05.400> you

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
one thing I also notice that if you

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.840 
one thing I also notice that if you
release<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.829> it's<00:04:08.720> nothing

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
release this it's nothing

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.780 
release this it's nothing
it<00:04:11.850> does<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.390> flow<00:04:12.930> saucy<00:04:13.770> it<00:04:14.040> sinks<00:04:14.460> down<00:04:14.490> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
it does not flow saucy it sinks down the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.990 
it does not flow saucy it sinks down the
bottom<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:16.200> it's<00:04:16.739> gonna<00:04:17.130> grab<00:04:17.400> your<00:04:17.580> sand

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
bottom so it's gonna grab your sand

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.770 
bottom so it's gonna grab your sand
whatever<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:19.290> on<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> substrate<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.720> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
whatever is on the substrate so you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.090 
whatever is on the substrate so you
won't<00:04:22.049> be<00:04:22.170> careful<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.800> too<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:25.100> that's

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
won't be careful of that too so that's

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.520 
won't be careful of that too so that's
pretty<00:04:26.520> much<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:27.060> mean<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.540> will<00:04:28.200> recommend

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
pretty much it I mean I will recommend

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.710 
pretty much it I mean I will recommend
to<00:04:28.890> may<00:04:29.310> be<00:04:29.370> useful<00:04:30.020> occasional<00:04:31.020> claiming<00:04:31.560> but

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
to may be useful occasional claiming but

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.630 
to may be useful occasional claiming but
it's<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.170> very<00:04:34.440> bad<00:04:34.680> product<00:04:35.340> at<00:04:35.460> all

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
it's so not very bad product at all

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's so not very bad product at all
especially<00:04:36.450> for<00:04:36.750> little<00:04:37.320> nano<00:04:37.560> tanks<00:04:38.330> super

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
especially for little nano tanks super

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.020 
especially for little nano tanks super
good<00:04:39.570> scrubber<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.490> might<00:04:41.700> want<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
good scrubber but you might want to

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.490 
good scrubber but you might want to
invest<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.480> something<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.320> can

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
invest is something that you can

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.010 
invest is something that you can
actually<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.250> actually<00:04:44.490> clean<00:04:45.120> or

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
actually that you can actually clean or

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.800 
actually that you can actually clean or
screw<00:04:46.620> up<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.950> bottom<00:04:47.520> taller<00:04:48.210> your<00:04:48.510> saw

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
screw up the bottom taller your saw

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.330 
screw up the bottom taller your saw
straight<00:04:49.200> cause<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.650> don't<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.070> thing

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
straight cause I don't think this thing

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.850 
straight cause I don't think this thing
will<00:04:50.520> get<00:04:51.510> near<00:04:51.900> your<00:04:52.170> substrate<00:04:54.230> so<00:04:55.230> there<00:04:55.680> is

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
will get near your substrate so there is

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.700 
will get near your substrate so there is
say<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:57.000> does<00:04:57.540> not<00:04:58.700> float<00:04:59.700> for<00:04:59.940> some<00:05:00.120> reason<00:05:00.710> so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
say it does not float for some reason so

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.100 
say it does not float for some reason so
it<00:05:01.830> sinks<00:05:02.100> down<00:05:02.430> there<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> gotta<00:05:03.630> get<00:05:03.870> out

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it sinks down there so you gotta get out

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.390 
it sinks down there so you gotta get out
and<00:05:05.360> sometimes<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.750> will<00:05:07.010> attach<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.220> to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
and sometimes it will attach it to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.160 
and sometimes it will attach it to
something<00:05:08.700> your<00:05:08.940> substrate<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.660> get<00:05:09.990> on<00:05:10.140> it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
something your substrate and get on it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.940 
something your substrate and get on it
so<00:05:10.940> make<00:05:11.940> sure<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.780> does<00:05:13.020> not<00:05:13.200> fall<00:05:13.470> down

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
so make sure that it does not fall down

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.030 
so make sure that it does not fall down
into<00:05:14.250> your<00:05:14.520> substrate
