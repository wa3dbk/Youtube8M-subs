like fucking hating life and don't keep
your<00:03:01.440> negativity<00:03:01.920> around<00:03:02.010> man<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.400> gotta

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
your negativity around man you gotta

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.980 
your negativity around man you gotta
move<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.989> is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:17.830 

I<00:03:10.780> don't<00:03:11.780> think<00:03:11.840> she<00:03:12.140> liked<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.320> here<00:03:16.840> okay

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
I don't think she liked you here okay

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:51.340 
I don't think she liked you here okay
well<00:03:19.270> just

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.470 

I<00:03:52.580> think<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:53.970> definitely<00:03:54.090> gonna<00:03:54.390> be

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
I think it's it's definitely gonna be

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720 
I think it's it's definitely gonna be
different<00:03:54.570> especially<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.890> you're<00:03:56.520> like

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
different especially if you're like

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
different especially if you're like
second<00:03:57.150> or<00:03:57.300> third<00:03:57.480> gen<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:58.500> you're<00:03:58.740> gonna

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
second or third gen like you're gonna

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.100 
second or third gen like you're gonna
probably<00:03:59.550> adapt<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.600> way<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.960> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
probably adapt to the way that the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.370 
probably adapt to the way that the
culture<00:04:01.440> here<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.710> in<00:04:01.830> America<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.380> hopefully

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
culture here is in America and hopefully

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.290 
culture here is in America and hopefully
we<00:04:04.890> all<00:04:05.010> don't<00:04:05.220> fall<00:04:05.400> into<00:04:05.700> like<00:04:05.820> hi<00:04:06.030> like

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
we all don't fall into like hi like

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.640 
we all don't fall into like hi like
divorce<00:04:06.630> rates<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.080> get<00:04:07.260> married<00:04:07.440> too

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
divorce rates and I get married too

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.400 
divorce rates and I get married too
young<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.720> hopefully<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:10.020> turns<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.350> to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
young but hopefully it just turns out to

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.290 
young but hopefully it just turns out to
be<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.590> very<00:04:10.800> mature<00:04:11.010> relationship<00:04:11.790> where<00:04:12.060> both

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.620 
work out all the kinks when you guys
fight<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:20.160> like<00:04:20.460> it's<00:04:21.030> good<00:04:21.300> to<00:04:21.510> have

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
fight because like it's good to have

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.780

fights<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.440> relationship<00:04:22.950> because<00:04:23.220> that's

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
fights in a relationship because that's

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.070 
fights in a relationship because that's
when<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.120> know<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.420> it's<00:04:24.600> actually<00:04:24.870> working

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
when you know that it's actually working

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.860 
when you know that it's actually working
if<00:04:25.410> one<00:04:25.980> person's<00:04:26.340> only<00:04:26.610> sees<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:27.480> way<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.810> do

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
if one person's only sees one way and do

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.120 
if one person's only sees one way and do
you<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.020> that's<00:04:28.170> right<00:04:28.440> all<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.830> time

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
you think that's right all the time

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.520 
you think that's right all the time
that's<00:04:29.790> not<00:04:29.940> necessarily<00:04:30.390> true<00:04:30.750> because<00:04:31.080> then

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
that's not necessarily true because then

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.840 
that's not necessarily true because then
there's<00:04:31.680> always<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.100> other<00:04:32.310> side<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
there's always the other side of the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.480 
there's always the other side of the
story<00:04:33.120> where<00:04:33.480> it's<00:04:34.080> like<00:04:34.230> they<00:04:35.040> see<00:04:35.100> something

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
story where it's like they see something

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.330 
story where it's like they see something
else<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.180> if<00:04:36.690> they<00:04:37.140> can<00:04:37.500> actually<00:04:37.830> convince

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
else and if they can actually convince

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.640 
else and if they can actually convince
you<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.940> see<00:04:39.120> their<00:04:39.330> other<00:04:39.480> side<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.170> you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
you to see their other side and you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.620 
you to see their other side and you
can't<00:04:40.860> understand<00:04:41.490> what<00:04:41.790> they're<00:04:42.390> coming

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
can't understand what they're coming

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.160 
can't understand what they're coming
from

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
from

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.310 
from
then<00:04:43.500> maybe<00:04:43.740> hopefully<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.670> can<00:04:44.940> just

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
then maybe hopefully that you can just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.030 
then maybe hopefully that you can just
figure<00:04:46.320> something<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.920> make<00:04:47.010> a

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
figure something out and make a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.950 
figure something out and make a
compromise<00:04:47.460> with<00:04:47.700> each<00:04:47.850> other<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.330> feel<00:04:48.810> like

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
compromise with each other I feel like

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.920 
compromise with each other I feel like
in<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.200> future<00:04:49.590> everyone<00:04:50.190> would<00:04:50.520> be<00:04:50.700> very<00:04:51.060> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
in the future everyone would be very I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.870 
in the future everyone would be very I
think<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> traditional<00:04:53.370> people<00:04:53.550> would

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
think like the traditional people would

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.380 
think like the traditional people would
want<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.870> be<00:04:55.320> very<00:04:55.710> like<00:04:56.340> lovey-dovey<00:04:56.970> still

want to be very like lovey-dovey still

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
cuz I mean they still even know it like

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.420 
cuz I mean they still even know it like
