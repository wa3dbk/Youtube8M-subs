00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this is called a head check just make

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.150 
this is called a head check just make
sure<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.930> don't<00:02:34.140> take<00:02:34.380> your<00:02:34.530> eyes<00:02:34.709> off<00:02:34.739> the

road ahead for more than one second

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.250 
road ahead for more than one second
so<00:02:37.920> scanning<00:02:38.489> includes<00:02:38.910> looking<00:02:39.750> ahead

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so scanning includes looking ahead

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
so scanning includes looking ahead
looking<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.400> rear-view<00:02:41.459> mirrors<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
looking in your rear-view mirrors and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.570 
looking in your rear-view mirrors and
looking<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.380> sides<00:02:43.680> by<00:02:44.010> doing<00:02:44.340> head

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
looking to your sides by doing head
