spray on a clear topcoat and this is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.429 
spray on a clear topcoat and this is
actually<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> question<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.800> get<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.189> lot<00:00:21.439> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
actually a question that I get a lot the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
actually a question that I get a lot the
people<00:00:22.769> were<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.250> constantly<00:00:23.730> asking<00:00:24.029> me

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
people were just constantly asking me

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960 
people were just constantly asking me
about<00:00:24.240> topcoat<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> gloss<00:00:26.010> versus<00:00:26.490> flat<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
about topcoat and gloss versus flat and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 
about topcoat and gloss versus flat and
all<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> stuff<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.410> figured<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.220> would

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
all that stuff so I figured this would

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.319 
all that stuff so I figured this would
be<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> perfect<00:00:29.910> time<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.599> show<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:32.329> now

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
be the perfect time to show that off now

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.610 
be the perfect time to show that off now

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
bother with satin or semi gloss just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.999 
bother with satin or semi gloss just
because<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:25.770> really

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
because I don't know I just don't really

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.140 
because I don't know I just don't really
care<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> usually<00:01:26.759> stick<00:01:27.119> with

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
care for it so I usually stick with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.789 
care for it so I usually stick with
either<00:01:27.420> gloss<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.380> flat<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.909> uh

I<00:02:10.410> usually<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.099> stick<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> cheap

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I usually just stick with the cheap

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720 
I usually just stick with the cheap
stuff

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
stuff

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.420 
stuff
but<00:02:13.300> yeah<00:02:13.750> there's<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.080> about<00:02:14.530> any<00:02:14.830> paint

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
but yeah there's just about any paint

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.309 
but yeah there's just about any paint
company<00:02:15.879> out<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.870> make<00:02:17.049> some

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
company out there is going to make some

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.199 
company out there is going to make some
sort<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.680> clear<00:02:18.099> topcoat<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.569> can<00:02:19.720> use

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
sort of clear topcoat that you can use

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.559 
sort of clear topcoat that you can use
so<00:02:22.209> let<00:02:23.170> me<00:02:23.349> put<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.769> camera<00:02:23.950> right<00:02:24.129> here<00:02:24.700> and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
so let me put the camera right here and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.530 
so let me put the camera right here and
basically<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:26.799> gonna<00:02:27.519> treat<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.060> top<00:02:28.269> coat

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
basically we're gonna treat the top coat

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.350 
basically we're gonna treat the top coat
the<00:02:28.720> same<00:02:29.019> exact<00:02:29.500> way<00:02:29.709> we've<00:02:30.670> been<00:02:30.879> treating

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
the same exact way we've been treating

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.190 
the same exact way we've been treating
all<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.349> other<00:02:32.530> paints<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.129> far<00:02:33.900> spraying<00:02:34.900> in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
all the other paints so far spraying in

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.280 
all the other paints so far spraying in
the<00:02:35.230> same<00:02:35.530> exact<00:02:35.890> manner<00:02:37.110> basically<00:02:38.110> just

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the same exact manner basically just

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.250 
the same exact manner basically just
really<00:02:38.650> close<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.250> parts<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.329> in<00:02:40.840> really

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
really close to the parts and in really

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.039 
really close to the parts and in really
fast<00:02:42.420> short<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.720> bursts<00:02:45.629> just<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
fast short little bursts just like that

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.979 
fast short little bursts just like that
and<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.140> course<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:51.010> can't<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.370> tell<00:02:51.670> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
and of course you can't really tell it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.380 
and of course you can't really tell it
because<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.859> flat<00:02:54.160> coat<00:02:54.400> has<00:02:54.549> yet<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.879> dry<00:02:55.090> but

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
because the flat coat has yet to dry but

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.259 
because the flat coat has yet to dry but
when<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.840> does<00:02:56.049> get<00:02:56.230> dry<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:57.849> notice

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
when it does get dry you will notice

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.800 
when it does get dry you will notice
that<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.540> has<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.690> very<00:02:59.109> nice<00:02:59.349> smooth<00:03:00.359> yet<00:03:01.359> flat

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that it has a very nice smooth yet flat

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.430 
that it has a very nice smooth yet flat
non<00:03:02.560> reflective<00:03:03.900> surface<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:07.690> this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
non reflective surface and really this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.800 
non reflective surface and really this
is<00:03:08.739> actually<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.489> my<00:03:09.700> favorite<00:03:10.209> parts<00:03:10.569> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
is actually one of my favorite parts of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.280 
is actually one of my favorite parts of
the<00:03:11.260> entire<00:03:11.620> modeling<00:03:12.099> process<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:14.079> dole

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
the entire modeling process is the dole

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.960 
the entire modeling process is the dole
coating<00:03:14.680> because<00:03:14.859> this<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.519> point<00:03:15.790> where

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
coating because this is the point where

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.030 
coating because this is the point where
you<00:03:16.030> finally<00:03:16.420> get<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.079> what<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.470> model

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
you finally get to see what the model

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.699 
you finally get to see what the model
kit<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.459> gonna<00:03:18.639> look<00:03:18.819> like<00:03:19.090> at<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.109> end<00:03:20.319> and

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
kit is gonna look like at the end and

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.839 
kit is gonna look like at the end and
it's<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.359> you'd<00:03:22.359> be<00:03:22.480> surprised<00:03:22.959> how<00:03:23.700> much<00:03:24.700> of

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
it's just you'd be surprised how much of

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's just you'd be surprised how much of
a<00:03:24.910> difference<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:26.410> clear<00:03:27.160> flat<00:03:27.489> coat<00:03:27.790> can

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
a difference that a clear flat coat can

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.009 
a difference that a clear flat coat can
make<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.799> mean<00:03:29.980> once<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.459> goes<00:03:30.669> on<00:03:31.019> it's

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
make because I mean once it goes on it's

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.650 
make because I mean once it goes on it's
just<00:03:32.380> really<00:03:32.620> really<00:03:32.919> uh<00:03:33.150> brings<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.510> whole

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
just really really uh brings the whole

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
just really really uh brings the whole
kit<00:03:34.870> together<00:03:35.049> from<00:03:35.980> an<00:03:36.220> aesthetic

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
kit together from an aesthetic

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.110 
kit together from an aesthetic
standpoint<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:38.040> couple<00:03:39.040> tips<00:03:39.310> about<00:03:39.549> using<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
standpoint a couple tips about using a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.000 
standpoint a couple tips about using a
flat<00:03:40.510> coat<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:42.569> don't<00:03:43.569> know<00:03:43.810> why<00:03:44.440> maybe<00:03:44.769> it's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
flat coat I don't know why maybe it's

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.159 
flat coat I don't know why maybe it's
just<00:03:45.280> where<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.609> live<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.180> don't<00:03:46.239> know<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:46.690> uh<00:03:46.720> I

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
just where I live I don't know but uh I

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.909 
just where I live I don't know but uh I
find<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.950> best<00:03:48.130> time<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.489> use<00:03:49.650> top<00:03:50.650> coat

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
find that the best time to use top coat

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.210 
find that the best time to use top coat
is<00:03:51.130> first<00:03:51.849> thing<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.450> morning<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
is first thing in the morning and it's

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.099 
is first thing in the morning and it's
about<00:03:54.400> ten<00:03:54.880> o'clock<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.419> morning<00:03:55.810> where

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
about ten o'clock in the morning where

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.009 
about ten o'clock in the morning where
I'm<00:03:56.230> at<00:03:56.379> right<00:03:56.410> now<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:58.239> think<00:03:58.480> what<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:58.989> is

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
I'm at right now and I think what it is

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.270 
I'm at right now and I think what it is
is<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.700> coolness<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.389> humidity<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.280> what

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
is the coolness and the humidity is what

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.309 
is the coolness and the humidity is what
makes<00:04:03.579> flat<00:04:04.060> coat<00:04:04.389> work<00:04:04.810> better<00:04:05.049> in<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
makes flat coat work better in the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.809 
makes flat coat work better in the
morning

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
morning

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.390 
morning
because<00:04:06.819> when<00:04:07.419> it's<00:04:07.599> cooler<00:04:07.810> outside<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
because when it's cooler outside the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.319 
because when it's cooler outside the
flat<00:04:09.760> coat<00:04:10.030> dries<00:04:10.690> slower<00:04:11.910> having<00:04:12.910> giving<00:04:13.209> it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
flat coat dries slower having giving it

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.990 
flat coat dries slower having giving it
more<00:04:13.599> time<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.379> kind<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.370> get<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:15.699> flat

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
more time to kind of get it's flat

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.849 
more time to kind of get it's flat
finish<00:04:16.419> because<00:04:17.169> if<00:04:17.289> it's<00:04:17.410> really<00:04:17.680> hot

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
finish because if it's really hot

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.940 
finish because if it's really hot
outside<00:04:18.359> then<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:20.079> paint<00:04:20.349> dries<00:04:20.620> really

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
outside then the paint dries really

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.440 
outside then the paint dries really
quick<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.579> doesn't<00:04:21.880> have<00:04:21.969> a<00:04:22.030> chance<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
quick and it doesn't have a chance to

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.640 
quick and it doesn't have a chance to
get<00:04:22.570> flat<00:04:22.930> yet

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
get flat yet

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.210 
get flat yet
so<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:25.600> how<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.080> coolness<00:04:26.590> comes<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:26.979> also

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
so that's how the coolness comes in also

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.600 
so that's how the coolness comes in also
humidity<00:04:28.150> for<00:04:28.870> some<00:04:29.080> reason<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.889> makes<00:04:30.190> flat
