should be noted that you do not have to
have<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.189> there<00:01:49.369> yeah<00:01:49.789> in<00:01:50.179> order<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.450> do

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
have that in there yeah in order to do

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.029 
have that in there yeah in order to do
studies<00:01:50.929> but<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.319> is<00:01:51.469> nice<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.709> know<00:01:51.979> if

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
studies but it is nice you know if

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.589 
studies but it is nice you know if
you're<00:01:52.130> doing<00:01:52.159> an<00:01:52.399> OB<00:01:52.670> patient<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.389> can

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
you're doing an OB patient that you can

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.379 
you're doing an OB patient that you can
put<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.249> LMP<00:01:55.249> or<00:01:55.459> EDD<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.240> it'll

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
put in the LMP or EDD and it'll

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.999 
put in the LMP or EDD and it'll
calculate<00:01:56.779> that<00:01:56.899> information<00:01:57.469> for<00:01:57.709> you

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
calculate that information for you

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.129 
calculate that information for you
and<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.939> navigate<00:01:59.359> it<00:01:59.509> looks<00:01:59.719> like<00:01:59.869> if<00:02:00.049> I

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
and so to navigate it looks like if I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.839 
and so to navigate it looks like if I
just<00:02:00.349> move<00:02:00.529> my<00:02:00.560> trackball<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.429> will<00:02:01.579> highlight

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
just move my trackball it will highlight

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.209 
just move my trackball it will highlight
wherever<00:02:02.569> I<00:02:02.659> want<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:02.959> go<00:02:03.079> yep<00:02:03.409> correct<00:02:03.770> yep<00:02:04.039> so

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
wherever I want to go yep correct yep so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.760 
wherever I want to go yep correct yep so
as<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.459> move<00:02:04.579> that<00:02:04.789> trackball<00:02:05.329> that's<00:02:05.770> that's

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
as you move that trackball that's that's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949 
as you move that trackball that's that's
important<00:02:07.340> piece<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:08.030> m7<00:02:08.569> is<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
important piece of the m7 is when you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.719 
important piece of the m7 is when you
move<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.319> trackball<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.950> moves<00:02:10.160> your<00:02:10.280> cursor

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
move the trackball it moves your cursor

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.930 
move the trackball it moves your cursor
or<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.090> arrow<00:02:11.530> your<00:02:12.530> yeah<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.550> allows<00:02:13.730> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
or your arrow your yeah and allows you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.910 
or your arrow your yeah and allows you
to<00:02:14.030> jump<00:02:14.240> between<00:02:14.569> fields<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.230> don't<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.800> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
to jump between fields I don't have to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920 
to jump between fields I don't have to
hit<00:02:16.010> set<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.580> put<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.120> over<00:02:17.239> correct<00:02:17.720> yep

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
hit set I just put it over correct yep

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.270 
hit set I just put it over correct yep
and<00:02:18.019> then<00:02:18.140> you're<00:02:18.230> gonna<00:02:18.349> start<00:02:18.560> typing<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
you can also use the tab key right there

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:22.430 
you can also use the tab key right there
to<00:02:21.980> move

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
to move

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
to move
between<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> fields<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.250> well<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:24.180> that'll

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
between the fields as well so that'll

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
between the fields as well so that'll
allow<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.660> because<00:02:25.020> some<00:02:25.230> users<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.340> use

little thing saying like because this is
our<00:02:55.770> demo<00:02:56.070> system<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.270> DICOM

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
our demo system that the the DICOM

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.590 
our demo system that the the DICOM
that'll<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:59.010> something<00:02:59.190> i<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the crux of where a decision is made on

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.380 
the crux of where a decision is made on
upon<00:03:13.440> what<00:03:13.710> type<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:14.160> transducer<00:03:14.880> you're

going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> use<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.200> which<00:03:16.380> exam<00:03:16.770> preset<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.460> if

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
going to use and which exam preset so if

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.950 
going to use and which exam preset so if
you<00:03:17.610> go<00:03:17.700> ahead<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.060> hit<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.300> exam<00:03:18.660> button

you go ahead and hit the exam button
just<00:03:19.470> below<00:03:19.680> patient<00:03:20.250> ID<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:21.450> pulls<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.140> all

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
just below patient ID it pulls up all

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.170 
just below patient ID it pulls up all
three<00:03:22.710> transducers<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.490> are<00:03:23.700> plugged<00:03:23.970> in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
three transducers that are plugged in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.700 
three transducers that are plugged in
into<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> multi<00:03:24.930> port<00:03:25.140> connect<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.590> we

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
into the multi port connect that we

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.460 
into the multi port connect that we
talked<00:03:25.920> about<00:03:26.010> earlier<00:03:26.459> okay<00:03:27.200> yep<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.350> you'll

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
talked about earlier okay yep and you'll

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.830 
talked about earlier okay yep and you'll
see<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.830> have<00:03:28.890> your<00:03:29.000> c<00:03:30.000> v<00:03:30.209> 2<00:03:30.480> which<00:03:30.720> is

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
see that you have your c v 2 which is

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.590 
see that you have your c v 2 which is
the<00:03:30.989> curvilinear<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.920> p4<00:03:32.459> 2's<00:03:32.940> which<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
the curvilinear the p4 2's which is the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.770 
the curvilinear the p4 2's which is the
phased-array<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.310> L<00:03:35.700> 12<00:03:36.030> 4s<00:03:36.510> which

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
phased-array and then the L 12 4s which

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.300 
phased-array and then the L 12 4s which
is<00:03:36.930> our<00:03:37.080> linear<00:03:37.410> okay

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
is our linear okay

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.390 
is our linear okay
and<00:03:38.820> we'll<00:03:39.690> note<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:40.140> users<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.680> don't<00:03:41.130> have

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
and we'll note for users that don't have

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.130 
and we'll note for users that don't have
the<00:03:41.580> multi<00:03:41.880> port<00:03:42.090> connector<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.020> have

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the multi port connector and just have

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.810 
the multi port connector and just have
one<00:03:43.410> transducer<00:03:44.070> plugged<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.580> back<00:03:44.730> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
one transducer plugged in the back of

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.880 
one transducer plugged in the back of
the<00:03:44.880> machine<00:03:45.180> when<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.230> hit<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.530> exam

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the machine when you hit that exam

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.920 
the machine when you hit that exam
button<00:03:47.220> you'll<00:03:47.700> still<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.360> same<00:03:48.600> screen

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
button you'll still get this same screen

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.840 
button you'll still get this same screen
however<00:03:49.709> it'll<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.730> one

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
however it'll just have the one

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.970 
however it'll just have the one
transducer<00:03:51.570> plugged<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:52.019> there<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.769> allow

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
transducer plugged in there and allow

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.620 
transducer plugged in there and allow
you<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.430> all<00:03:53.459> these<00:03:53.730> options<00:03:53.970> you'll<00:03:54.390> see

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
you to have all these options you'll see

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.210 
you to have all these options you'll see
that<00:03:54.840> there's<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.350> whole<00:03:55.530> big<00:03:55.769> list<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.190> each

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
that there's a whole big list on each

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.050 
that there's a whole big list on each
transducer

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
transducer

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.790 
transducer
and<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:58.200> may<00:03:58.350> be<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.500> little<00:03:58.709> bit

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
and that may be a little bit

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.040 
and that may be a little bit
overwhelming<00:03:59.120> especially<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.630> users<00:04:00.930> that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
overwhelming especially for users that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.620 
overwhelming especially for users that
are<00:04:01.170> only<00:04:01.410> using<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.890> m7<00:04:02.400> for<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:03.060> specific

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
are only using the m7 for a specific

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.449 
are only using the m7 for a specific
skill<00:04:04.230> set<00:04:04.530> mm-hmm

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
skill set mm-hmm

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.710 
skill set mm-hmm
and<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.720> will<00:04:07.380> make<00:04:07.650> those<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.850> know<00:04:08.970> you

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
and so that will make those you know you

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.600 
and so that will make those you know you
more<00:04:09.959> user<00:04:10.230> friendly<00:04:10.350> list<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.430> you
