00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.369 
cool because you want the paddle to be a
certain<00:01:52.030> length<00:01:52.179> depending<00:01:52.659> on<00:01:52.780> how<00:01:52.899> tall<00:01:53.170> the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:53.379 
certain length depending on how tall the

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.589 
certain length depending on how tall the
person<00:01:53.739> is<00:01:53.829> using<00:01:54.039> it<00:01:54.310> okay<00:01:54.610> how<00:01:55.030> important<00:01:55.479> it

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
person is using it okay how important it

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.369 
person is using it okay how important it
is<00:01:55.810> like<00:01:56.079> balance<00:01:57.039> um<00:01:57.719> balances<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:59.140> know<00:01:59.259> if

00:01:59.369 --> 00:01:59.379 
is like balance um balances you know if

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.319 
is like balance um balances you know if
you<00:01:59.469> can<00:01:59.649> walk<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.369> straight<00:02:00.549> line<00:02:00.670> I've

then<00:02:01.689> we<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:02.020> probably<00:02:02.259> stand<00:02:02.679> up<00:02:02.770> paddle

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.129 
then we can probably stand up paddle

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:05.279
