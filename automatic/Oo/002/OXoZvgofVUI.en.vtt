00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.410 
looked too just because you have a lot
of<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.640> options<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of lot of options you can take from the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 
of lot of options you can take from the
palette<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.020> after<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.860> took<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.280> gunmetal

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
palette so after that I took a gunmetal

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.399 
palette so after that I took a gunmetal
what<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> shade<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.049> started

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
what kind of shade and I started

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.350 
what kind of shade and I started
contouring<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> face<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.790> add<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.329> more

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
contouring the face to add a bit more

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.109 
contouring the face to add a bit more
depth<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:02.070> also<00:02:02.310> blend<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
depth to it and I also blend it up the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.270 
depth to it and I also blend it up the
edges<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.509> make<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> look<00:02:03.899> more

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
edges to make you look more

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
realistic after that I just took the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.219

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
same shadow and I just started creating

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.410 
same shadow and I just started creating
a<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:09.709> design<00:02:10.069> on<00:02:10.100> my<00:02:10.729> forehead<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.390> make

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
just decided not to make it totally even

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.140 
just decided not to make it totally even
and<00:02:49.310> add<00:02:49.550> an<00:02:50.060> x<00:02:50.360> mark<00:02:50.510> over<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.319> like<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.459> don't

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
and add an x mark over it like I don't

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.820 
and add an x mark over it like I don't
know<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.420> felt<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.110> I'm<00:02:54.500> doing

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.100 
know I just felt like I'm doing
something<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:55.280> bit<00:02:55.370> more<00:02:55.430> different<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.360> this

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
something a bit more different and this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.930 
something a bit more different and this
turned<00:02:57.350> out<00:02:57.470> really<00:02:57.769> really<00:02:57.890> well<00:02:58.100> I'm<00:02:58.400> really

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
turned out really really well I'm really

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.110 
turned out really really well I'm really
happy<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.300> how<00:02:59.690> I<00:03:00.050> did<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.830> yeah<00:03:01.640> after

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
happy with how I did it and yeah after

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.050 
happy with how I did it and yeah after
that<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.510> colored<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.260> my<00:03:03.470> nose<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
that I just colored in my nose you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.120 
that I just colored in my nose you
really<00:03:05.480> want<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.750> make<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.019> really<00:03:06.560> opaque

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
really want to make it really opaque

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.830 
really want to make it really opaque
because<00:03:07.610> calla<00:03:07.940> tones<00:03:08.180> don't<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.690> have

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
because calla tones don't really have

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.530 
because calla tones don't really have
any<00:03:09.049> noses<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.640> make<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.850> as<00:03:11.120> black<00:03:11.390> as

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
any noses so just make it as black as

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.479 
any noses so just make it as black as
possible<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.230> don't<00:03:12.500> forget<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.799> color<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
possible and don't forget to color the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.550 
possible and don't forget to color the
bottom<00:03:13.970> part<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.360> your<00:03:14.510> nose<00:03:14.630> because<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.320> is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
bottom part of your nose because it is

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.530 
bottom part of your nose because it is
going<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.860> show<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.579> don't<00:03:16.790> like<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.390> it's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
going to show if you don't like and it's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.690 
going to show if you don't like and it's
going<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.750> mess<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.860> make<00:03:19.400> make

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
that I took the detailed brush and I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.170 
that I took the detailed brush and I
started<00:03:23.989> kind<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.860> emphasizing<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.760> details

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
started kind of emphasizing the details

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.600 
started kind of emphasizing the details
making<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.750> more<00:03:26.989> 3d<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.890> then<00:03:28.190> you're<00:03:28.370> done
