00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.640
 the writer knew books like scissors 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.660
 to see from outside 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 I became a reader I assume that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 because my parents kept many of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.740
 the books that I had in childhood and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.560
 in a fairly large collection 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.650
 There are those who say that I liked reading a lot 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.690
 I believe that the fact also of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.150
 and to have been a man was a house 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.760
 where women predominated 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.010
 it took me a bit to isolate a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.470
 look for company in the free when I 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.340
 I had to think I was going to turn 15 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.490
 years 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 my maternal grandfather gave me romeo and 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.550
 julieta and that for me was like entering 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 by an important door to the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 universal literature 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.940
 know shakespeare from that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.729
 book and from there I have not stopped reading it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.400
 I think it influenced me a lot as well 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 Writer 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 from 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 from that book I think I took great pleasure 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 to love stories in literature 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.750
 and it's something that I also give away 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 books and I try not to lend ourselves sometimes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.870
 I see myself cornered in a situation 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.180
 uncomfortable in which the book you lend it 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.979
 but rather chose to give them 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.310
 if someone wants that book a book that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.020
 I have then rather I prefer 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 a moment to buy it and give it to him 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 so that I have kept copies 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.090
 let's see there is a book that I read 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.399
 some years does not do so many but 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.750
 but I think it does as good 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.789
 since it was published that is called the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.870
 cormac mccarthy road is an author 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.730
 American that I love 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.820
 and that's a book that when I read it 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.560
 he says that everybody read it and it's a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.480
 book that I give with the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.810
 companies that you're going to love that's going 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.810
 to be able to move 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 and it is also what I recommend most 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 always and the one that more gift there is an appointment 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.670
 I read it in a rilke book 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.490
 letters to a young poet 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.700
 that a reader friend told me about that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.280
 quote words more words less says 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.020
 that if you can not make the decision to 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.370
 not writing is better to take it 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.370
 It's like a warning 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.120
 to the world of writing that one should 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.620
 enter and that is a pretty world 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.989
 complicated there is a quote that when 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.790
 when I speak to you for example young people who 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.370
 they are beginning to write 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.780
 He stressed it a lot about a writer who 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.960
 she is interested in being thirsty 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.740
 and she said she already had a 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.170
 to the computer of which he had written 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.610
 I write a little bit every day 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.620
 hope and without despair 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.910
 I think that 's an important apprentice 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.490
 for the fourth person who wants to start 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.530
 to write to keep calm the 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.530
 patience and perseverance at the time
