00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:01.649
 very easy 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.890
 in assists notorious Vienna 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.079
 as follows 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.389
 the crowd makes it look young women 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.879
 in order to reserve one must be the game character does not speak a word we 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.230
 are not fully out there that people live there anymore that it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.599
 now girls built what they are different here 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.699
 14 animals 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.789
 the nice black-haired in the foreground 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.060
 around 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.609
 this mark is to be seen that in real time «one can move freely 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.440
 plan lasts has the show off as it is actually there and flanking and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.010
 the like is not possible 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.620
 which is a pity 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 You realize that the root of the game is the creators of ROG Alexy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790
 Mason is made to pull aequo 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.020
 and the figures are also subjects of the German master in euros 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.610
 quite similar 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.370
 and of course a card reader as in previous years Blaine Down 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.280
 He does not really play a role in singleplayer mode 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.730
 but you can get one 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.350
 by making nobody big eyes and legs everything besides too 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.180
 adequate connection 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 and of course there are crazy monsters 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.880
 Interested 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.790
 the feeling would be up here 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.710
 cute because I know sorted 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 Thorogood Nuts Crack Merkel's Dollar APA 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 and figures are very small 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 around 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.850
 Protagonist is 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.640
 Leonard im not the player character 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.430
 and this young man has a son he can become a white knight 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.370
 transform 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 Ossenberg ex-top division Japanese 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.310
 the models with giant robots now in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 the president of the humboldt foundation Riesenrad 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.539
 that of course staged accordingly 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.489
 it is every time this data Switzerland 7 1 though the first time 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.229
 c-mor equal to normal, when I turned my particular draft 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.060
 It was spectacular with cats 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.660
 and he was important to a Wetterau on it 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 all are also the black moments you have to say clearly combat system 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.100
 have to fight for the numbers »are far too simple and are not tactical 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.449
 really demanding 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 beautifully staged upon receipt 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.429
 this one can always unleash or is that 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:24.339
 Hermann Mesch and his name one must try only with certain 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.329
 Everyday situations Action is itself numbers 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.779
 and so you have enough you can turn a look into a knight or 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.429
 perform other special attacks 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.809
 the immigrants he could choirs these clubs quietly now unfortunately counterattack 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.989
 The mirror had but as said hours can not be particularly for Ufa 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.779
 Normal mode basically needed 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.779
 what is appropriate and therefore the lower class needs 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.119
 but for role-playing fans you certainly no one is able to subject 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.979
 staged 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:56.219
 so light food prematurely to earth next time it is today she finds 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.040
 at the horizon 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 It is a big company 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.889
 and the bad ones never did 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.889
 Roshan journey has black tide 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 which corrects 4% 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.259
 the camera yes 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.649
 we need a middle-aged sad that he leaves 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.319
 the clutter 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.869
 if on 1
