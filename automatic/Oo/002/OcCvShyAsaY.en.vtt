somebody come out on the handlebars
whatever<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.210> gage<00:00:24.210> face<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.920> you

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
whatever and gage face has when you you

get a pay for the wiring on this but the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
get a pay for the wiring on this but the
application<00:00:30.720> itself<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.410> free<00:00:31.920> and

little gage faces that you can choose
from<00:00:41.989> for<00:00:42.989> example<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.059> stand<00:00:45.829> just

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
from for example you will stand just

from for example you will stand just
just<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> quick<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.030> demonstration

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
just go to a quick little demonstration

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.920 
just go to a quick little demonstration
what<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.960> look<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:56.930> going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
what they look like but there's going

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.569 
what they look like but there's going
through<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.649> example<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.430> looks

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
through a little example what it looks

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
through a little example what it looks
like<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:02.090> that's<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.250> mostly

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
like there that's the one that I mostly

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.660 
like there that's the one that I mostly
use<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> do

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
use is this one here and then all you do

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
use is this one here and then all you do
is<00:01:09.890> connect<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:12.350> plug<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> case

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
is connect your plug it into the case

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:28.359 
is connect your plug it into the case
here<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.909> turn<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.270> bike

tachometer what-have-you
I'll<00:01:46.170> start<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:49.140> garage

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I'll start it up here I'm in my garage

I'll start it up here I'm in my garage
and<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.860> raining<00:01:50.399> outside<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.170> might<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and it's raining outside so might be a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.370 
and it's raining outside so might be a
little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.649> loud<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little bit loud but you can kind of have

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:16.690 
little bit loud but you can kind of have
an<00:01:55.530> idea<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> looks<00:01:56.790> like

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.789 

and<00:02:18.769> that's<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> gauge<00:02:20.129> face<00:02:20.400> takes<00:02:21.359> oh<00:02:21.799> five

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
and that's the gauge face takes oh five

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.149 
and that's the gauge face takes oh five
minutes<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.340> install<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.810> wire<00:02:25.139> here<00:02:25.639> we'll

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
minutes to install this wire here we'll

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.500 
minutes to install this wire here we'll
run<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:30.260> down<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.530> through<00:02:31.739> here<00:02:32.189> across<00:02:33.060> over

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
run it down in through here across over

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.770 
run it down in through here across over
my<00:02:33.889> gas<00:02:34.889> tank<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.939> see<00:02:36.209> where<00:02:36.389> it<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.659> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
my gas tank you can see where it kind of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.940 
my gas tank you can see where it kind of
pops<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.769> here<00:02:38.099> underneath<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.349> seat<00:02:40.349> here<00:02:40.799> I

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
pops out here underneath the seat here I

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.899 
pops out here underneath the seat here I
could<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.040> done<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.219> little<00:02:44.310> bit<00:02:44.549> better<00:02:44.669> job

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
could have done a little bit better job

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.179 
could have done a little bit better job
but<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.389> just<00:02:45.810> kind<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.469> did<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:46.859> kind<00:02:47.129> of

but I just kind of did it kind of
quickly<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.639> then<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.560> axle<00:02:49.889> gauge<00:02:50.159> face

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
quickly and then the axle gauge face

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.319 
quickly and then the axle gauge face
plug<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.489> over<00:02:53.489> here<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.879> you're<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.269> your
