00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.089
 today at 12 o'clock according to your local 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.849
 the time will happen the inevitable change of day 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.679
 and nights also inevitably decrease 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.679
 and optimization of construction costs 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.750
 your home welcome to 3 cards 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.039
 where we look at the obvious 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.770
 cost reduction method 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.390
 building your home 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 Today we will consider another 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 interesting topic is the level of your house 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 It is suitable for sites from sloping I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 I honestly declare that this way 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 is not always possible to apply but I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 set out to give you a comprehensive 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 information about all the main ways 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.950
 saving and reducing cost 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.520
 building your house I don't want that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 it happened to you as in that proverb 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 good thoughts comes afterwards you should 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.309
 know all the main ways and u of them 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.180
 choose the ones that suit you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.640
 would be appropriate 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.350
 exactly in your case so what's 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.950
 is the way to level your home 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.570
 let's consider a specific situation 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.540
 we have here we have the entrance to the house if 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.369
 we will do what he is on the same level 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.549
 that is, the beer will also be on the same level 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:26.640
 then in this place we will go out 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.880
 plot here at that height of about 22 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.009
 meters and it is from 13 degrees agree 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.979
 pretty awkward every time you go down 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.790
 and climb to a height of 2 meters therefore 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.030
 for convenience, let's say a move on this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.950
 the stairs here would be appropriate here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 shown by a gray dotted line 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.399
 to fill the ground in this place to the level 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.890
 example of media steps that is about 1 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.899
 meter we need to fill up with this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.079
 there will be an inevitable increase 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.899
 cost of work since we 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.200
 just this amount of land you need 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.299
 get stuffed tamp and act dignify 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.670
 let's see what can be done in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.959
 In this case, we can apply 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.400
 level that is to do a smooth slide 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.410
 level of your home here first we are here 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 reduced by three steps and then 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.630
 on the terrace itself also made three 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.269
 steps and lowered the level 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.580
 cuirass we got just the very 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.400
 seven steps that are optimal for 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.700
 which is comfortable to walk and which are not 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.830
 cause discomfort in the background i 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 gray boat showed that option 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.110
 which we had the previous slide and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.440
 so what we see we see what we have 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.299
 decrease occurred first 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.940
 the distance we have our steps 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.920
 moved up to the house and therefore a meter 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 sixty we could this one instead 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.349
 optimize this first moment second 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 moment we could just at that very 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.650
 meter reduce the height of the terrace and the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.489
 we made the least amount 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.670
 steps 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.299
 so on optimization that we have here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.769
 it turned out what we got the winnings 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.769
 First of all, we answered, I showed 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.940
 decreased length of the height of these pillars 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.000
 terraces first moment second moment of us 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.220
 the number of steps has decreased one more 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.220
 moment and we have decreased here in this 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:38.370
 place that is, let's say this one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.400
 a small fragment of the wall and we can 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.340
 make less n provided we have 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.709
 the height of the house that's the height of the room 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 the same is preserved 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.450
 interesting way well as i said he 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.549
 not in all cases therefore applicable 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 look at your project if we have 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.750
 eat and see how much you can 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.150
 optimize it using 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.040
 level is the most interesting moment 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:09.530
 the fact that the level of our house is practically 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.530
 repeat the relief of the land that is 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:16.660
 our ground floor floor is also a bit 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.410
 goes down to the exit like the existing 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.079
 ground level 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.449
 this way is still good so that we can 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.530
 combine it with the previous two 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.940
 ways and that we had the first way 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.960
 is to abandon the basement 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.090
 as you can see in this version we have 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.210
 the basement is the first moment the second moment 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.919
 we can optimize the foundation and we 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.229
 we can apply a shallow depth 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.419
 the foundation these all ways is beautiful 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.360
 combined with this third way 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.150
 so now tick somewhere in your 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.850
 head possible on a piece of paper that 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.210
 There is such a way that you can use 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.680
 levels of the house and don't be shy about it when 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.350
 this is his than much greater comfort 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.460
 movement and we can reduce a little 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.639
 its construction costs i think that 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.470
 we will be able to make sure that 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.180
 optimizing the cost of construction 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.180
 your home see you soon
