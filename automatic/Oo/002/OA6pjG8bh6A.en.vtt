00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the brow plumper is a little bit

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.179 
the brow plumper is a little bit
different<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> brush<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.070> actually

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
different of a brush and I actually

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
different of a brush and I actually
think<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> brush<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.840> is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
very very well it is kind of a different

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.690 
very very well it is kind of a different
shade<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.710> brow<00:02:04.710> drama<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.310> feel<00:02:05.549> like

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
really really hated this ball and I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.030 
really really hated this ball and I
would<00:03:23.010> say<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.310> not<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.670> best<00:03:24.120> application

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
would say it's not the best application

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.220 
would say it's not the best application
but<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.460> not<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:26.790> bad<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.270> as<00:03:27.570> people<00:03:27.990> think

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.250 
like covered in hair for the most part
it<00:03:47.370> should<00:03:47.400> stay<00:03:48.030> pretty<00:03:48.540> much<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:49.410> your<00:03:49.470> brows

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
fake or Kid Don so that's the difference

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.310

when<00:04:05.070> done<00:04:05.340> when<00:04:05.940> undone<00:04:06.420> as<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.960> tell<00:04:07.140> it

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
when done when undone as you can tell it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.590 
when done when undone as you can tell it
just<00:04:07.350> kind<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.800> holds<00:04:08.100> everything<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.520> place

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
just kind of holds everything in place

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.030 
just kind of holds everything in place
makes<00:04:09.600> everything<00:04:09.840> look<00:04:09.990> nice<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.470> neat<00:04:10.590> and

makes everything look nice and neat and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040 
makes everything look nice and neat and
I<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.490> think<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:11.910> matches<00:04:12.090> my<00:04:12.450> color<00:04:12.690> pretty

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
used this a couple times so it's not a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.670 
used this a couple times so it's not a
complete<00:04:23.610> first<00:04:23.820> impression

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
and it's a little different to get the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.270 
and it's a little different to get the
hang<00:04:30.199> of<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.850> from<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.380> ball<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.740> was<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.130> used

to using the ball that this brush

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.390 
to using the ball that this brush
actually<00:04:36.110> took<00:04:36.440> me<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.680> little<00:04:36.770> bit<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.100> time<00:04:37.250> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
actually took me a little bit of time to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.920 
actually took me a little bit of time to
get<00:04:37.490> used<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:37.820> doing<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.210> can<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.510> guys<00:04:38.660> see<00:04:38.810> me

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
okay and I feel like this formula is a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.500 
okay and I feel like this formula is a
little<00:04:44.750> wetter<00:04:45.639> than<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.880> Maybelline<00:04:47.300> the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
little wetter than the Maybelline the

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.210 
little wetter than the Maybelline the
Maybelline<00:04:47.990> one<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> biggest<00:04:48.860> complaints

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
Maybelline one of the biggest complaints

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.740 
Maybelline one of the biggest complaints
I<00:04:49.490> heard<00:04:49.669> about<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.940> was<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:50.449> a<00:04:50.570> bit

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
I heard about it was that it's a bit

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.020 
I heard about it was that it's a bit
sticky<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.949> I<00:04:52.130> would<00:04:52.280> agree<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.699> I

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
sticky and I would agree with that I

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.460 
sticky and I would agree with that I
feel<00:04:53.120> like<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.720> little<00:04:53.930> bit<00:04:54.080> sticky<00:04:54.440> but

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
feel like it is a little bit sticky but

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.330 
feel like it is a little bit sticky but
once<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:54.919> dries<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.190> really<00:04:55.639> can't<00:04:55.880> feel<00:04:56.210> that

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
once it dries you really can't feel that

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.779 
once it dries you really can't feel that
as<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.639> tell<00:04:58.789> there<00:04:59.000> is<00:04:59.199> definitely<00:05:00.199> a

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
as you can tell there is definitely a

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.740 
as you can tell there is definitely a
shade<00:05:01.789> difference<00:05:02.300> here<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.970> feel<00:05:05.360> like<00:05:05.419> the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
shade difference here I feel like the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.310 
shade difference here I feel like the
L'Oreal<00:05:06.260> is<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.860> lot<00:05:07.190> redder<00:05:08.150> if<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.139> makes

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
L'Oreal is a lot redder if that makes

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.340 
L'Oreal is a lot redder if that makes
sense<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.880> has<00:05:11.419> more<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:11.810> an<00:05:12.050> orangey

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
sense it has more of like an orangey

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.460 
sense it has more of like an orangey
tone<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:13.660> whereas<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:16.930> Maybelline<00:05:17.930> like<00:05:18.320> I

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
tone to it whereas the Maybelline like I

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.850 
tone to it whereas the Maybelline like I
said<00:05:18.680> has<00:05:19.039> more<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.460> an<00:05:19.550> ashy<00:05:19.760> tone<00:05:20.440> overall<00:05:21.440> I

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
the reason I can wear it is because my

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.300 
the reason I can wear it is because my

feel like if you were a very light

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.820 
feel like if you were a very light
blonde<00:05:58.240> this<00:05:59.240> would<00:05:59.510> not<00:05:59.660> necessarily<00:05:59.870> be<00:06:00.680> the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
blonde this would not necessarily be the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.010 
blonde this would not necessarily be the
best<00:06:00.860> look<00:06:01.370> for<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.729> but<00:06:01.760> if<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.389> are<00:06:02.690> like<00:06:02.990> a

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
best look for you but if you are like a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.290 
best look for you but if you are like a
light<00:06:03.410> brown<00:06:03.800> then<00:06:04.789> it<00:06:04.910> might<00:06:05.090> look<00:06:05.240> really

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
light brown then it might look really

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.270 
light brown then it might look really
good<00:06:05.660> on<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:05.930> as<00:06:06.080> well<00:06:06.260> so<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:06.979> it<00:06:07.250> just

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
good on you as well so I think it just

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.860 
good on you as well so I think it just
kind<00:06:07.550> of<00:06:07.669> depends<00:06:08.090> on<00:06:08.150> your<00:06:08.210> natural<00:06:08.479> hair

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
kind of depends on your natural hair

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.409 
kind of depends on your natural hair
color<00:06:09.220> and<00:06:10.220> your<00:06:10.280> natural<00:06:10.580> brow<00:06:10.970> color<00:06:11.270> as

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.770 
color and your natural brow color as
