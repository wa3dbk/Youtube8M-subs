00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
capacity of this gun so I'm going to try

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.050 
capacity of this gun so I'm going to try
and<00:01:48.799> fire<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.250> see<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.700> get<00:01:49.849> it<00:01:49.939> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.109 
and fire and see if I can get it to
reload<00:01:51.369> but<00:01:53.709> it's<00:01:54.709> it's<00:01:55.159> got<00:01:55.399> quite<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.819> lot<00:01:56.000> of

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
reload but it's it's got quite a lot of

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:07.419 
reload but it's it's got quite a lot of
ammo<00:01:56.390> so<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:05.450> don't<00:02:06.409> think<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.039> reload

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429
