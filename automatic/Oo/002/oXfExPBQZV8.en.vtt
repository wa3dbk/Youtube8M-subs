00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.600
 in Russia in the 16th century called the package 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.330
 he looked then really not too 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 gracefully 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.679
 whether it's modern 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.650
 floor coverings such as parquet 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.249
 board 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.079
 By the way, you can put it in one place. 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.949
 day 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.019
 all that you do not mean bad floorboard 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.300
 good movie fedora home drove 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 first prepare the floor about 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.449
 if time allows 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 assigned to him if scheduled 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 Moscow will help build Western 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.280
 countries 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.900
 the destruction of the aircraft is 5 10 years 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 started practicing temperature differences 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.470
 on the background we lay the substrate if you live 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.920
 on the first floor you need more seriously 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 it will protect the board from moisture in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.780
 In other cases, cork is suitable for 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.390
 besides, it will serve as an excellent 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 sound insulation 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.880
 so that my work will help commission chala 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
 thundering career 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.960
 now we mount the floorboard 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.860
 hell not necessarily back down go 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 centimeters 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.260
 to mark the gap sticking insert 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.120
 wooden floors can be swedish 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.660
 make and bans panels and she 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.570
 second and third of our team 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.520
 not to break the panels do it 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.560
 45 degrees only 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.290
 then the rows are fitted to each other by wood 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.020
 hammer must go all over 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 row only then he will fall into place 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.990
 the second 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.840
 it is also important to properly position the junction 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050
 the spirit possess the chess order of her 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.630
 size means that the success of the previous 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 I did not think the same as the list 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.380
 subsequent 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.869
 then the load on the foundation will be evenly 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.869
 and cover and crackle at the seams 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 it remains only to close the gap between 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.280
 plinth wall and board 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.610
