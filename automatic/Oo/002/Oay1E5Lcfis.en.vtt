whether<00:03:26.819> director<00:03:27.510> was<00:03:27.659> a<00:03:27.689> male<00:03:27.959> or<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.139> female

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
whether director was a male or a female

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.069 
whether director was a male or a female
and<00:03:29.669> I<00:03:30.090> think<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.629> way<00:03:30.659> it<00:03:30.840> should<00:03:30.900> be

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
and I think that's the way it should be

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.990 
and I think that's the way it should be
that<00:03:31.739> you're<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.069> director<00:03:32.400> you're<00:03:32.819> not<00:03:32.970> a

that you're a director you're not a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.059
