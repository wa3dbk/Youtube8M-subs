00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 very well we are all in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.970
 points 2 let's see a mod a macrista 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.790
 pretty cool 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.800
 now too long ago either 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.630
 we made a mod that was from the team fortress 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.590
 2 that added some dispensers so very 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.789
 pimps this adds some turrets that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.260
 I assumed that entry translates it as 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.240
 sentries but but hey I call him 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 turrets and that's it and it's pretty 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.670
 pretty cool let's go to see how 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 they are done first let's see the the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.430
 tripod would be that it is made with iron 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.620
 as you are seeing here then the part 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.930
 this one here is done with a dispenser 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 four iron two gunpowder and two 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 reston and then we just have to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.770
 put the dye the red dye and we have 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.770
 that this one here is very cool 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.950
 mola can move much but hey it 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.050
 I miss it and the question if we do 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.970
 been here that we should also 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.970
 do it with six of rest on two buttons 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.980
 and a crystal we make this kind of 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.380
 rare command but good is for 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.420
 schedule it we give you right click and as 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.830
 You see we can choose whoever attacks for 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.310
 defect comes this the gas clipper 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.450
 giant pit zombie slim skeleton and 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.740
 zombie 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 but we can also put the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.020
 spiders etc etc. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 and we're going to see who's cool a lot 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.270
 is that bullets are often not seen 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.680
 they're almost going out there but you see 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.300
 a little 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 but super ethical it also seems that 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 whenever I'm putting critters for 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.640
 try it seems they get mad at the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 turret as much but is super cool 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.340
 you really see it seems that they get angry and 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.010
 They want to destroy it but good too 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.290
 we have to do this here for 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.090
 example this undoes with iron like os 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.950
 dais watching here is a little weird the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 kraft eo but we can do it well 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.220
 Gold also now is much better 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.450
 but good is that with this in your hand and 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.580
 we click right and we can see the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 ammunition that has and so on if you 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.070
 we stick with this clear we increase it 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.320
 both life and ammunition and this from 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.929
 down here is the level that you can upload 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.700
 level now we will see it but it is very 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.180
 very cool as you are watching is not for 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.200
 protect the house but what happens the chicken 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.090
 Where is 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.730
 God is very cool then blue is made 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.000
 exactly the same but exactly the same 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.819
 in fact if we have one red by 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.099
 example this red if we put one of 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.629
 lapis lazuli rush in blue or blue 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.019
 with one of red dye we turn it into 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.340
 the red that are exactly the same or 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.340
 not several huy has turned upside down 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.700
 you do not turn around, so it follows 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.770
 they will continue 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.980
 how cool it is to the noise it makes 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.269
 super epic but we can give it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.610
 blows as you have seen it for 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.550
 recharge the ammunition etcetera and also 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.930
 we level them up with this apart that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.080
 is spent before we had very little level 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.630
 with gold it has more uses and it goes up 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.580
 faster at the level bar , look at it 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:10.220
 Spain reveals that cool but good 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.220
 turn much faster than that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.120
 you see 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.080
 they go up a lot in the fastest ones 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.080
 let's try like this 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.030
 and if you can see the pellets as 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.850
 skis super episodes but good if you 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.220
 he liked the ammunition a lot 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.410
 a blow and a blow but good we're going to 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.590
 see the last level 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.800
 a kind of androids or they look like 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.400
 look how cool 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.750
 being in a pile the tripod is little 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.280
 weird but it goes up that's it and this is more 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.280
 of up explosives 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.060
 shoot and explosive the super epic 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.640
 but well let's try it better 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.410
 this is going to be very very epic expects that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.700
 I need that 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.700
 let's put creepers 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.530
 2 how they become super crazy this 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.480
 it seems an invasion and careful because if 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 he pisses you animals for you 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.680
 they paint charged that they have some 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.730
 but it's like ball is also changes 1 and 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.350
 it seems that the other also changes the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.540
 objective of at least that's how it seemed to me 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.620
 it's also that I've put too many in 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.620
 this position too simply 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.939
 sometimes put ammunition in addition this is 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.209
 as you see also the ammunition here below 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:41.839
 the rockets and the bullets then you have to go 

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:44.929
 with the eye kit but it's super epic 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:46.910
 like the older one and it stays the taste of 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:48.350
 the bugs is shooting 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.160
 but we'll leave it here 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.160
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.930
 when they get close they explode nobles 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.119
 it stimulates us a lot even noise 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.119
 what does he do but good 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.960
 they 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.960
 We did not know if the dispensers 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.650
 but I hope you liked it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 bye 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.930
 ah
