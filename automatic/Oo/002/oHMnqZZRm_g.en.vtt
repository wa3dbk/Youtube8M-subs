00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:11.490
 my name is johan le bon 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.460
 I have been cycling since the age of eighteen 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 years later I started with the fact that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 30 mountain bikes and then I got on the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609
 road 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.230
 so if that's done now I'm going to do 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.230
 my fourth professional year 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 for sure it's something that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.680
 will remain engraved for life but hey it's 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.400
 something I have that I forget that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.760
 I try to forget 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.970
 good I have junior and professionals already 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 it's not the same thing and then I got 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 badly debut pros in my debut at 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.340
 the pros I had a lot of difficulties in 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.140
 adapt myself so I try to forget everything 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
 that and resume from scratch was a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 runner like the others it's true that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.180
 we were waiting for a little bit of me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.409
 put myself pressure and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 that's why I want to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.600
 reset everything so that I want 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.350
 to forget that behind me that's for sure 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 it's a good result 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.119
 very nice result had good 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.940
 moments but a certain level I think 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.150
 he must put it behind and leaves 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.150
 to zero 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.750
 four years at this game him things 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.750
 past so that's it's not 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.340
 the experience of racers of the pack but 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.440
 I had a few maquis 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.010
 experiences 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.710
 good it's like to say that my results 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.940
 level results I speak we are not 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.340
 face is from my results but 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 level experience I feel the difference 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.850
 from year to year that I learned 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.040
 a lot 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.400
 I was lucky already two conscious 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.580
 mainland continental after one is 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.050
 spent two years in pro continental so 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.690
 with little by little I mounted the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.690
 marches and that's what satisfies me 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.230
 it was a young team already a 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.590
 team a little more family than it was 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 a squad of 16 runners so a little 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.850
 less important even than the challenge 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.630
 so good that it has changed enormously 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 I think I know everyone 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.580
 not only between the staff and the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.190
 runners that makes a number that has changed 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.540
 in that way his wife comes this is where 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.310
 one of the biggest teams is even 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.020
 there the biggest team 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.989
 back in France they go one like very 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.370
 beautiful 2nd place globally so 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.590
 it is true that it is fun and then 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.380
 try surprisingly to spend brittany 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.620
 schuller to this team there they go 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.489
 also propose a challenge that also 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.150
 to interest me must relaunch of duty 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.650
 really what I am worth and I in 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.650
 thank you for trusting me and 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.630
 now it's up to me to prove it and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.330
 to prove that they were right and I hope 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.390
 that it will do that I will satisfy 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.120
 the world that awaits me and jc when 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.570
 even a team that lives there since 97 his 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.070
 life will lead years so 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.790
 so it's true to see everything 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.180
 time the 90th I was 7 when I 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.140
 advise to bike so I always 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 known this team 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.640
 and then good 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.280
 and a lot of Britons who have 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.710
 hurry in this team partly 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 frederic guesdon so I know him well 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.080
 that I saw in training all that 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.570
 at events brittany so it's 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.120
 While it's good and then 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.010
 I hope to do that I'm going to do the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.150
 same thing with young people and it's going 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.150
 to make dream young Bretons 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.010
 I am a coach 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.799
 I change 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.860
 manager I change all that and that that 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.319
 I think that will renew everything and 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.840
 it's a new challenge new staff 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.790
 will do good I am currently 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.400
 trained by frédéric raf and then yes 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.639
 since early November that I think about 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.639
 trails 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.440
 we benefit it would be rather it is 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.860
 true that against the road this is a 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.320
 race that I absolutely love the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.139
 military forces after I really like 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 racing in classical or Belgian so 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.789
 mans style I was lucky enough to do 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.880
 paris volleyball the hand blad it's 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.130
 races that will attract a lot 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.199
 now after I hope I hope we 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.669
 was trying dote to have really if 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.650
 it's against what I like but 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.840
 it is true that it is race 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.120
 that make you dream the new ones I do not 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.580
 do not know yet if they will do me 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.240
 participate in this kind of race but 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.150
 it's my wish is to go into these 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.919
 races there with the team was doing j have 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.660
 is to do the best I can and 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.660
 then do the work that will be asked of me
