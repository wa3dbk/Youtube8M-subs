00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:45.290

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:52.060
 to the web and friend Laura and the clicks of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.060
 truth here we all want 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.920

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.370
 Yes Yes 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.200
 good compaÃ±eras and compaÃ±eros we are in 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.970
 this moment in the process of editing 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.530
 all the voices together with Pablo 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.970
 day and complicate the teacher's woes 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 ricard sales to explain it 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.459
 the characters peeling the eye 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.830
 they entered the study and practically 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.390
 take one such as I are as such as 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.950
 they are there was no preparation 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.870
 strange of 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.569
 of arrangements nothing was simply recorded 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.660
 as I did not feel and that's what he created 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.640
 like a very cute very real movement of 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.060
 the song I'm very happy with the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.330
 product because it feels is reflected in 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
 this recording the spirit that we want 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.840
 achieve with the song how many channels 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.070
 more or less I use exterior pablo as 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.280
 a few channels in the recording 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.790
 normal 13 channels one per character per 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.770
 per person the channel of the track and what 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.400
 what is left is this to record the voices and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.290
 process them and I have the recording was 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680
 relatively easy with multiplying 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.389
 very fast and and hoping that it is what 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.710
 rather possible good very fast 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.410
 we are talking about two more hours or 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.180
 least to do this little sketch that 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.000
 you are going to observe ok to observe and 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.200
 this one three minutes 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.970
 We can play lasted about two hours 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.160
 elaborating all that is part of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.900
 realization of the voices now my 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.900
 partner the editing part
