economic work I guess the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
economic work I guess the
environmentally<00:00:59.100> friendly<00:00:59.460> approach<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
environmentally friendly approach is the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
environmentally friendly approach is the

technology that is also present here at
the<00:01:09.659> taipei<00:01:09.990> computex<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.549> we

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the taipei computex what can what can we

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
the taipei computex what can what can we
expect<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.180> year<00:01:12.450> coming<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:12.930> forward<00:01:13.260> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
expect this year coming from forward in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
expect this year coming from forward in
terms<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.680> technology<00:01:14.299> well<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.479> mean<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
terms of technology well I mean this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
terms of technology well I mean this
year<00:01:16.020> we've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.380> obviously<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.070> talking

year we've got obviously we're talking

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
year we've got obviously we're talking
about<00:01:17.310> work<00:01:17.670> tomm<00:01:17.850> adapalene<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.869> example<00:01:19.259> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
about work tomm adapalene for example so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
about work tomm adapalene for example so
the<00:01:20.220> gap<00:01:20.400> link<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> great<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> great

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
know that a lot of people are actually

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.420 
know that a lot of people are actually
using<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.680> smartphones<00:01:32.130> while<00:01:32.310> they're

obviously business development leads to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.390 
obviously business development leads to
kind<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:07.019> spend<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.410> our<00:03:07.530> time<00:03:07.590> out

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.759 
apps are appropriate to be used in the
vehicle<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.660> obviously<00:03:15.989> hearing<00:03:16.470> directly

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
vehicle so obviously hearing directly

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.090 
vehicle so obviously hearing directly
from<00:03:17.090> customers<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:19.200> they<00:03:19.230> want<00:03:19.350> will<00:03:19.890> help

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
from customers what they want will help

from customers what they want will help
us<00:03:20.390> engage<00:03:21.390> with<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.230> developers<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.860> try

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
us engage with with developers and try

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.620 
us engage with with developers and try
and<00:03:23.130> find<00:03:23.340> experiences<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.150> people<00:03:24.209> really

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
and find experiences that people really

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.390 
and find experiences that people really
really<00:03:24.959> want<00:03:25.200> right<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.070> that's<00:03:26.250> what

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
really want right I think that's what

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.310 
really want right I think that's what
we're<00:03:26.519> that's<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.360> power<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.810> plank<00:03:28.110> is

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
we're that's the power of a plank is

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.860 
we're that's the power of a plank is
that<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.769> technology<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.549> we<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.750> not

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
that the technology that we have are not

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.720 
that the technology that we have are not
embedded<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> vehicle<00:03:31.799> right<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.610> that

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
embedded in the vehicle right so that

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.310 
embedded in the vehicle right so that
would<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:33.000> very<00:03:33.150> limiting<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.810> terms<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.140> what

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
would be very limiting in terms of what

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.870 
would be very limiting in terms of what
apps<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.769> experience<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:35.250> what<00:03:35.430> experiences

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
apps and experience or what experiences

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.520 
apps and experience or what experiences
we<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.180> actually<00:03:36.299> deliver<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.260> actual

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
we can actually deliver to the actual

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.160 
we can actually deliver to the actual
driver<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> fact<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.570> apps<00:03:39.750> live<00:03:40.049> on

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
driver so the fact that the apps live on

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930 
driver so the fact that the apps live on
the<00:03:40.230> smartphone<00:03:40.500> means<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.130> can<00:03:41.340> deliver

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the smartphone means that we can deliver

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910 
the smartphone means that we can deliver
a<00:03:42.239> whole<00:03:42.510> range<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:43.079> different<00:03:43.140> experiences

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
a whole range of different experiences

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860 
a whole range of different experiences
that<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.519> otherwise<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:45.150> able<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.630> be

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that would not otherwise be able to be

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.630 
that would not otherwise be able to be
you<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.380> be<00:03:46.739> available<00:03:47.100> for<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.280> customers

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
you know be available for the customers

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.580 
you know be available for the customers
yeah<00:03:48.000> I'm<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:48.690> entirely<00:03:48.959> true<00:03:49.200> i<00:03:49.290> mean<00:03:49.470> i

to<00:04:23.550> vehicle<00:04:23.700> function<00:04:24.419> now<00:04:24.599> we<00:04:25.020> need<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.229> little

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
to vehicle function now we need a little

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.440 
to vehicle function now we need a little
bit<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.620> X<00:04:25.919> Club<00:04:26.070> explanation<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.060> one

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
bit of X Club explanation of this one

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.980 
bit of X Club explanation of this one
so<00:04:28.350> vehicle<00:04:29.070> vehicle<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.610> vehicle<00:04:29.640> is<00:04:30.210> really

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
so vehicle vehicle the vehicle is really

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.260 
so vehicle vehicle the vehicle is really
into<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.350> realm<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.150> Internet<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.180> Things

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
into the realm of the Internet of Things

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.360 
into the realm of the Internet of Things
now<00:04:33.750> right<00:04:34.050> right<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.590> vehicle<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> thing

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
now right right the vehicle is a thing

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.160 
now right right the vehicle is a thing
and<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.210> they<00:04:36.390> need<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.570> be<00:04:36.660> able<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.870> speak<00:04:37.020> to

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
and so they need to be able to speak to

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.360 
and so they need to be able to speak to
each<00:04:37.410> other<00:04:37.560> they<00:04:37.740> need<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.920> understand

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
each other they need to understand

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.680 
each other they need to understand
what's<00:04:38.520> going<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.880> around<00:04:39.000> them<00:04:39.420> so<00:04:39.570> that

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
what's going on around them so that

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.540 
what's going on around them so that
drivers<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.380> be<00:04:40.410> safer<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.190> everybody

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
drivers can be safer so that everybody

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.010 
drivers can be safer so that everybody
around<00:04:41.760> them<00:04:41.970> whether<00:04:42.210> it's<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:42.480> pedestrian

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
around them whether it's a pedestrian

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.690 
around them whether it's a pedestrian
even<00:04:43.110> or<00:04:43.440> somebody<00:04:44.040> else<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.310> another<00:04:44.370> vehicle

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
even or somebody else in another vehicle

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.220 
even or somebody else in another vehicle
can<00:04:45.000> be<00:04:45.030> safer<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.080> way

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
can be safer so this way

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.660 
can be safer so this way
vehicle-to-vehicle<00:04:46.740> they're<00:04:47.190> communicating

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
vehicle-to-vehicle they're communicating

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.280 
vehicle-to-vehicle they're communicating
to<00:04:47.910> each<00:04:47.940> other<00:04:48.240> they're<00:04:48.660> gathering<00:04:49.110> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
to each other they're gathering the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.600 
to each other they're gathering the
information<00:04:49.560> from<00:04:49.980> what's<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.490> around

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
information from what's going on around

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.180 
information from what's going on around
them<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:51.390> maybe<00:04:51.660> it's<00:04:51.840> not<00:04:51.990> even<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.830> vehicle

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
them so maybe it's not even the vehicle

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.500 
them so maybe it's not even the vehicle
right<00:04:53.340> next<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.790> you<00:04:53.970> can<00:04:54.330> pull

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
right next to you you can pull

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.180 
right next to you you can pull
information<00:04:54.720> from<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.230> vehicle<00:04:55.410> that's<00:04:55.650> maybe

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
information from a vehicle that's maybe

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.520 
information from a vehicle that's maybe
20<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> 30<00:04:57.420> meters<00:04:57.570> ahead<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.470> you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
20 to 30 meters ahead of you and you

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.020 
20 to 30 meters ahead of you and you
know<00:04:58.770> when<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.070> vehicle<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.550> slowing<00:04:59.910> down

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
know when that vehicle is slowing down

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.760 
know when that vehicle is slowing down
or<00:05:00.090> braking<00:05:00.660> or<00:05:00.810> if<00:05:01.170> something<00:05:01.380> that's<00:05:01.620> run

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
or braking or if something that's run

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.830 
or braking or if something that's run
into<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.070> road<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.910> alerts<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.480> and

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
into the road so that it alerts you and

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.270 
into the road so that it alerts you and
you've<00:05:04.320> got<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.620> ability<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:05.100> make<00:05:05.250> a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
you've got the ability to make a

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.400 
you've got the ability to make a
decision<00:05:05.460> based<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.240> technology<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.260> be

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
decision based on that technology to be

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.810 
decision based on that technology to be
a<00:05:07.440> safer<00:05:07.830> driver<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.490> make<00:05:08.610> sure<00:05:08.640> that

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
a safer driver and to make sure that

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.120 
a safer driver and to make sure that
people<00:05:08.880> around<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.360> are<00:05:09.390> safer<00:05:09.810> as<00:05:09.900> well<00:05:10.130> so

good job right but it's the idea of
again<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.870> vehicle<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.410> vehicle<00:05:46.440> the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
again the vehicle to vehicle the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.830 
again the vehicle to vehicle the
technology<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.640> we've<00:05:47.820> got<00:05:47.970> inside<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.480> the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
technology that we've got inside and the

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.590 
technology that we've got inside and the
fact<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.170> nowadays<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:50.850> things<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.390> we're

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
fact that nowadays the things that we're

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.390 
fact that nowadays the things that we're
working<00:05:51.780> on<00:05:52.110> are<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.680> things<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.010> people

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
working on are the things that people

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.320 
working on are the things that people
have<00:05:53.490> like<00:05:53.670> you<00:05:53.760> said<00:05:53.910> have<00:05:54.000> already<00:05:54.210> been

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
have like you said have already been

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.090 
have like you said have already been
doing<00:05:54.660> outside<00:05:55.200> of<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.410> vehicle<00:05:55.590> so<00:05:55.950> it's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
doing outside of the vehicle so it's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.100 
doing outside of the vehicle so it's
it's<00:05:56.460> just<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:56.760> ability<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.240> implement<00:05:57.840> that

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
it's just that ability to implement that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.810 
it's just that ability to implement that
in<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.380> vehicle<00:05:58.740> in<00:05:58.830> an<00:05:58.920> appropriate<00:05:59.370> way<00:05:59.460> and

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
in the vehicle in an appropriate way and

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.310 
in the vehicle in an appropriate way and
so<00:06:00.210> we're<00:06:00.360> really<00:06:00.480> excited<00:06:00.600> about<00:06:01.110> the

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
so we're really excited about the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.960 
so we're really excited about the
vehicle<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.710> vehicle<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:02.310> new<00:06:02.490> types<00:06:02.760> of

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
vehicle the vehicle the new types of

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.030 
vehicle the vehicle the new types of
EcoBoost<00:06:03.870> engines<00:06:04.380> and<00:06:04.530> how<00:06:04.650> those<00:06:04.800> things

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
EcoBoost engines and how those things

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.160 
EcoBoost engines and how those things
all<00:06:05.250> tie<00:06:05.520> together<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:06.300> not<00:06:06.450> the<00:06:06.600> individual

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
all tie together it's not the individual

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.990 
all tie together it's not the individual
components<00:06:07.800> anymore<00:06:08.160> it's<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.580> driving

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
components anymore it's the driving

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.420 
components anymore it's the driving
experience<00:06:09.120> it's<00:06:09.960> true<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.440> lions<00:06:11.280> do<00:06:11.370> you

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
experience it's true and lions do you

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.150 
experience it's true and lions do you
have<00:06:11.520> anything<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:11.790> add<00:06:11.900> well<00:06:12.900> no<00:06:13.800> I<00:06:13.830> think<00:06:14.100> you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
have anything to add well no I think you

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000
