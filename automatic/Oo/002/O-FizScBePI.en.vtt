louder<00:02:07.729> than<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.420> gums<00:02:08.720> when<00:02:09.289> I'm<00:02:09.500> gone<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.340> I

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
louder than the gums when I'm gone so I

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.789

sans will be shifting from my sight when

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.309 
sans will be shifting from my sight when
I<00:02:23.920> can't<00:02:24.920> add<00:02:25.129> my<00:02:25.370> name<00:02:25.430> into<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.450> flight<00:02:26.750> when

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
I can't add my name into the flight when

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:35.589 
I can't add my name into the flight when
I'm<00:02:27.470> gone<00:02:27.829> I<00:02:32.980> won't<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.220> laughing<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.269> lies

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.420 

Catholics<00:02:42.969> are<00:02:43.239> enough<00:02:43.689> to<00:02:44.049> die<00:02:44.530> when<00:02:45.250> I'm

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
Catholics are enough to die when I'm
