so for example I'm going to select this

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.480 
so for example I'm going to select this
one<00:05:22.539> what<00:05:22.900> is<00:05:23.130> then<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.250> am<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.880> direct<00:05:25.270> mode

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
one what is then I am in the direct mode

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.240 
one what is then I am in the direct mode
and<00:05:27.490> while<00:05:27.789> I'm<00:05:28.389> here<00:05:28.690> in<00:05:28.900> kind<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.349> a<00:05:29.470> person

and while I'm here in kind of a person
with<00:05:30.639> machine<00:05:33.479> item<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:35.169> move<00:05:35.440> around

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:46.730 

tell<00:05:38.850> them<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.300> raise<00:05:40.050> sales<00:05:43.190> doing<00:05:45.590> zoom<00:05:46.590> out

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.570 

so

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:12.379 

what's<00:06:04.879> wrong<00:06:06.069> fire<00:06:07.069> two<00:06:07.280> pounds

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.090 

we

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
we

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.939 
we
experimental<00:06:16.100> work<00:06:16.340> first<00:06:16.699> time<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.650> that's

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
experimental work first time so that's

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.730 
experimental work first time so that's
basically<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.960> regularly<00:06:20.960> visiting<00:06:21.650> a
