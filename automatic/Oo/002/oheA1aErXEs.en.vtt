hey<00:00:02.230> guys<00:00:02.409> in<00:00:02.620> the<00:00:02.680> last<00:00:02.860> video<00:00:03.100> I<00:00:03.159> got<00:00:03.340> a

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:03.399 
hey guys in the last video I got a

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.220 
hey guys in the last video I got a
Easton<00:00:03.939> to<00:00:04.120> ebuy<00:00:04.390> card<00:00:04.690> and<00:00:04.810> I<00:00:04.840> said<00:00:05.080> that<00:00:05.200> I

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.230 
Easton to ebuy card and I said that I

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.560 
Easton to ebuy card and I said that I
performed<00:00:05.650> poorly<00:00:05.830> so<00:00:06.760> I<00:00:06.790> got<00:00:07.150> something<00:00:07.480> else

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:07.570 
performed poorly so I got something else

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.799 
performed poorly so I got something else
to<00:00:07.690> compare<00:00:08.050> it<00:00:08.109> with<00:00:09.509> so<00:00:10.509> you<00:00:10.570> might<00:00:10.780> be

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
to compare it with so you might be

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.869 
to compare it with so you might be
asking<00:00:11.019> what's<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.530> difference<00:00:11.950> well<00:00:12.789> the

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
asking what's the difference well the

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.480 
asking what's the difference well the
last<00:00:13.059> one<00:00:13.269> was<00:00:13.419> made<00:00:13.599> in<00:00:13.629> Taiwan<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:15.129> new<00:00:15.339> one

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
last one was made in Taiwan the new one

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.529 
last one was made in Taiwan the new one
I<00:00:15.519> got<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:17.260> assembled<00:00:17.769> in<00:00:17.859> Japan<00:00:18.189> I<00:00:18.519> wanted<00:00:19.480> to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
I got is assembled in Japan I wanted to

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.759 
I got is assembled in Japan I wanted to
do<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.660> test<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.050> see<00:00:20.259> if<00:00:20.289> there's<00:00:20.590> any

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
do a test to see if there's any

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.230 
do a test to see if there's any
difference<00:00:20.890> between<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.429> two<00:00:21.580> or<00:00:21.910> for<00:00:22.150> now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
difference between the two or for now

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.700 
difference between the two or for now
let's<00:00:22.480> just<00:00:22.660> say<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.840> I<00:00:23.019> believe<00:00:23.439> there's<00:00:23.650> a

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
let's just say that I believe there's a

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.839 
let's just say that I believe there's a
difference<00:00:23.740> between<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.400> two<00:00:24.580> and<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.820> just

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
difference between the two and I just

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.730 
difference between the two and I just
want<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.179> see<00:00:25.269> by<00:00:25.509> how<00:00:25.660> much<00:00:25.869> also<00:00:26.470> wanted<00:00:26.679> to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
want to see by how much also wanted to

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.050 
want to see by how much also wanted to
make<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.919> note<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.490> Taiwan<00:00:27.849> version

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
make a note that the Taiwan version

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.210 
make a note that the Taiwan version
States<00:00:28.630> Taiwan<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.380> microSD<00:00:29.890> card<00:00:30.099> and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
States Taiwan on the microSD card and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.569

the SD adapter States China and the ones
assembled<00:00:33.820> in<00:00:34.090> Japan<00:00:34.390> just<00:00:34.660> States<00:00:34.899> Japan<00:00:35.320> and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
assembled in Japan just States Japan and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.380 
assembled in Japan just States Japan and
this<00:00:36.190> D<00:00:36.399> card<00:00:36.610> doesn't<00:00:36.789> have<00:00:36.940> anything<00:00:37.270> right

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
this D card doesn't have anything right

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.720 
this D card doesn't have anything right
not<00:00:37.570> yet<00:00:38.160> everything<00:00:39.160> else<00:00:39.340> pretty<00:00:39.610> much

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
not yet everything else pretty much

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.340 
not yet everything else pretty much
looks<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> same<00:00:42.510> maybe<00:00:43.510> other<00:00:43.750> than<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.140> fact

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
looks the same maybe other than the fact

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.200 
looks the same maybe other than the fact
that<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:45.160> Taiwan<00:00:45.489> versions<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:45.940> may<00:00:46.059> be<00:00:46.120> a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
that the Taiwan versions I may be a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.700 
that the Taiwan versions I may be a
little<00:00:46.359> bit<00:00:46.600> yellower<00:00:46.930> than<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.320> Japanese

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
little bit yellower than the Japanese

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.660 
little bit yellower than the Japanese
one<00:00:47.890> but<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.550> could<00:00:48.579> just<00:00:48.789> be<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.000> packaging

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
one but it could just be the packaging

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.009 
one but it could just be the packaging
to<00:00:51.670> run<00:00:51.820> this<00:00:51.910> test<00:00:52.149> I<00:00:52.329> download<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.780> tool

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
to run this test I download a tool

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.900 
to run this test I download a tool
called<00:00:53.170> crystal<00:00:53.590> disk<00:00:53.769> mark<00:00:54.010> it's<00:00:54.430> free<00:00:54.699> and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
called crystal disk mark it's free and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.250 
called crystal disk mark it's free and
I'll<00:00:55.000> put<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> link<00:00:55.510> on<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.690> right<00:00:55.840> side<00:00:55.870> it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
I'll put the link on the right side it's

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.380 
I'll put the link on the right side it's
very<00:00:56.320> straightforward<00:00:56.769> you<00:00:57.280> can<00:00:57.910> specify<00:00:58.149> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
very straightforward you can specify the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.000 
very straightforward you can specify the
size<00:00:58.719> of<00:00:58.840> data<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.289> drive<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.739> want<00:00:59.829> to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
size of data and drive you want to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.970 
size of data and drive you want to
perform<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.429> test<00:01:00.640> on<00:01:00.820> here<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:02.469> if<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.829> run

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
perform the test on here then if you run

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.170 
perform the test on here then if you run
the<00:01:03.100> program<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.670> will<00:01:03.760> tell<00:01:03.969> you<00:01:04.059> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
the program it will tell you the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.700 
the program it will tell you the
performance<00:01:04.660> for<00:01:04.780> sequential<00:01:05.110> read<00:01:05.470> write

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
performance for sequential read write

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.590 
performance for sequential read write
and<00:01:05.920> performs<00:01:06.549> two<00:01:06.700> random<00:01:07.060> read<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.420> write

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
and performs two random read and write

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.649 
and performs two random read and write
in<00:01:07.780> different<00:01:07.960> block<00:01:08.290> sizes<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.850> short<00:01:10.119> the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
in different block sizes so in short the

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.539 
in different block sizes so in short the
higher<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.990> number<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.409> get<00:01:11.560> here<00:01:11.860> better

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
higher the number you get here better

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.280 
higher the number you get here better
your<00:01:12.729> performance<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.509> I'm<00:01:13.630> using<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:14.020> micro

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
your performance is so I'm using a micro

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.499 
your performance is so I'm using a micro
SD<00:01:14.560> card<00:01:14.770> plugged<00:01:15.009> into<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.369> USB<00:01:15.400> adapter<00:01:15.880> which

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
SD card plugged into a USB adapter which

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.469 
SD card plugged into a USB adapter which
is<00:01:16.659> plugged<00:01:16.869> into<00:01:17.079> an<00:01:17.259> USB<00:01:17.799> hub<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.329> H

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
is plugged into an USB hub so the H

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.630 
is plugged into an USB hub so the H
Drive<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:20.110> they<00:01:20.619> want<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.860> mate<00:01:20.979> in<00:01:21.009> Japan<00:01:21.430> and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
Drive is they want to mate in Japan and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
Drive is they want to mate in Japan and
I<00:01:22.210> Drive<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> one<00:01:22.960> made<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.229> Taiwan<00:01:23.590> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I Drive is the one made in Taiwan so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.340 
I Drive is the one made in Taiwan so
just<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.150> make<00:01:25.299> sure<00:01:25.329> here<00:01:25.720> they're<00:01:26.020> both<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
just to make sure here they're both the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
just to make sure here they're both the
same<00:01:26.380> format<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:29.649> file<00:01:29.920> system<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.369> fat<00:01:30.610> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.950 

I'll<00:01:34.659> system<00:01:35.049> fat<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.439> they're<00:01:35.590> both<00:01:35.770> empty<00:01:35.920> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
I'll system fat and they're both empty I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.300 
I'll system fat and they're both empty I
have<00:01:37.960> two<00:01:38.200> instances<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.680> crystal<00:01:39.100> disk

SD<00:01:44.740> card<00:01:44.950> I'm<00:01:45.340> gonna<00:01:45.520> run<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.700> test

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.860 

I<00:01:52.340> didn't<00:01:53.030> think<00:01:53.150> there<00:01:53.330> was<00:01:53.390> gonna<00:01:53.510> be<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
I didn't think there was gonna be this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.870 
I didn't think there was gonna be this
much<00:01:54.140> difference<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.220> Taiwanese<00:01:55.850> version

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
much difference the Taiwanese version

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.050 
much difference the Taiwanese version
ran<00:01:56.420> about<00:01:56.750> 20<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.590> 25<00:01:57.920> percent<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.490> how<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
ran about 20 to 25 percent of how the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060 
ran about 20 to 25 percent of how the
Japanese<00:01:59.510> version<00:01:59.840> ran<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.260> also<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.860> right

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
Japanese version ran and also the right

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.670 
Japanese version ran and also the right
speed<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.000> about<00:02:02.150> 40<00:02:02.420> percent<00:02:02.750> or<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.620> I'm

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
speed it's about 40 percent or so so I'm

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.350 
speed it's about 40 percent or so so I'm
gonna<00:02:03.830> do<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:03.979> side-by-side<00:02:04.250> comparison<00:02:04.640> on

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
gonna do a side-by-side comparison on

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.870
