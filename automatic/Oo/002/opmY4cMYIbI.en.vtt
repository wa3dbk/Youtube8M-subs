00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.859
 attention this video can hurt to 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:09.120
 more sensitive people do not recommend 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.120
 under 11 years old 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.220
 hi friends of creepy people we are already 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 again giving scare crises in this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.180
 new video we are going to tell the story 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.010
 of a crepe and pasta that will not leave you 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.300
 indifferent 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.300
 it's about green and lime 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.280
 yes 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.270
 I remember the first time I saw him I went to 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.150
 Take a nighttime spin as normally 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.160
 I do not have to fear to leave 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 night since in my neighborhood the most crime 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.820
 great that has been committed is only the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.640
 of shoplifting or excessive 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.010
 speed was taking a walk by the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 park and I sat on a bench under 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.900
 a lamppost until a cat appeared 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.850
 black in front of me I heard him purr 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.890
 and it did not look like it was going to hurt me 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.650
 so he came over and I started 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.170
 caress him then he began to purr 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.869
 stronger and he started rubbing against 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.790
 my leg as cats do 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.460
 I would swear it looked like it was almost 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.740
 smiling something made a whisper in one of 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.890
 the bushes of the park and the cat came out 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.530
 fleeing it was getting very late like this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.330
 I started walking towards my house 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.280
 I arrived at my door and just when I got 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.770
 the key I heard a meow behind me or 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.470
 I turned around and there was the same 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.470
 cat sitting looking directly towards 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.050
 I knew that you should not feed the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.480
 wild animals but I could not help it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.000
 he looked very hungry 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.220
 I went into the house and quickly picked up a 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.710
 small paper plate and I put some 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.050
 small slices of ham I opened the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 door to give him but he was gone 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.060
 so I put the plate right in front of 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 my door after that I went to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.770
 bed as they were about eleven 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.870
 mean that night I woke up with something that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.200
 hit my window I turned around to 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.840
 see what was happening and I saw the same cat 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.740
 sitting to the right of the window 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.170
 definitely this time 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.810
 smiling his tail waved happily 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.610
 and bouncing against my window always 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.310
 I keep my blinds and curtains 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.990
 closed but when I saw the cat the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.410
 curtains opened and the blinds 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.480
 they were up I woke up that day 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.360
 without even remembering what I saw and 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.280
 happened that night and I prepared to go to 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
 work that caught me about 30 minutes 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.350
 from my house when I got to work in 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.380
 the parking lot right next to me 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.960
 car was he sitting again and 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.180
 smiling looking at me in that 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.830
 moment I knew something was happening and 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.020
 I called animal control 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.780
 Then I went home to try to 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.030
 calm down a bit just before I stay 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.950
 asleep and I heard kick the door of my 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.740
 bedroom but I confused it with the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.620
 washing machine or some other common sound but 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.780
 That morning I woke up scared because 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.390
 the same cat lay there at the end of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.630
 my bed asleep even with that smile on 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.970
 his face had already endured enough 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.220
 so I grabbed the cat by the collar what 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.800
 I threw the backyard and hit it with 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.900
 a shovel to death throughout the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 process he did not give me even once 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.850
 when I was able to regain control of my 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.370
 thoughts and actions the cat was 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.100
 unrecognizable his two front legs 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.770
 they were broken the right ear was 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.320
 broken his ribs were demolished and his 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.110
 face had a huge gap I could not 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.000
 believe what he had done he had to go to 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.709
 work that day so I put his 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.780
 mutilated body in a box 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 I went away from the city and buried it 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.670
 near a forest next to the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.490
 road you know why because I am a 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.670
 idiot I was really agitated by 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.770
 the happened 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.830
 how I had gotten that cat in my 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.959
 room and much less to my house not 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.569
 I wanted to think about it so I went back to my 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.400
 house and I fell exhausted in bed I was 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.220
 slept almost all day but I 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.019
 I wish I had slept more time 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.940
 I woke up on my own and he said 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.889
 forced to look immediately towards me 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.620
 window and I saw something that was marked 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.560
 for the rest of my life that cat was 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.810
 with all his body shattered with a 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.540
 smile bigger than ever and looking 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.000
 towards me his eyes were completely 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.870
 blacks he looked at me and started to move 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.639
 strange his limbs were red and still 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.760
 so he was shaking in a way 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.010
 supernatural his left leg was 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.800
 half destroyed and his ear bled 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.930
 I still screamed and ran for my life 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.540
 I got in my car and I went as far as 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.669
 that I could of the cities now I'm 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.860
 trying to start a new life in a 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.139
 new place and I hope not to have to 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.290
 relate to wild animals never 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.290
 plus 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.530

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.949
