00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.850 
definitely think that drug stores have
the<00:05:02.310> best<00:05:02.640> miss<00:05:02.940> Harris<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.540> there's<00:05:04.320> so

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
the best miss Harris and there's so

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.770 
the best miss Harris and there's so
there's<00:05:04.890> really<00:05:05.310> no<00:05:05.520> use<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:06.120> splurge<00:05:06.419> on<00:05:06.660> the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
there's really no use to splurge on the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.150 
there's really no use to splurge on the
MLS<00:05:07.080> you've<00:05:07.320> really<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:07.770> like<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.950> high-end

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
MLS you've really really like a high-end

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.220 
MLS you've really really like a high-end
mascara<00:05:08.640> but<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.180> reason<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.510> like<00:05:09.660> falsies<00:05:10.080> is

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
mascara but the reason I like falsies is

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.860 
mascara but the reason I like falsies is
because<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.560> wand<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.190> curved<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:12.510> can<00:05:12.660> see

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
because the wand is curved you can see

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.280 
because the wand is curved you can see
that<00:05:13.050> it's<00:05:13.350> like<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:14.000> frown<00:05:15.000> or<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> smile<00:05:15.960> this

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
that it's like a frown or a smile this

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.080 
that it's like a frown or a smile this
way<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.220> why<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.370> like<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.700> because<00:05:17.910> I

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
way and so why I like this because I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.940 
way and so why I like this because I
have<00:05:18.180> really<00:05:18.419> long<00:05:18.570> lashes<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.380> I<00:05:19.800> don't

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
have really long lashes and I don't

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.500 
have really long lashes and I don't
really<00:05:20.040> like<00:05:20.160> curling<00:05:20.490> my<00:05:20.610> lashes<00:05:20.640> because<00:05:21.270> it

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
really like curling my lashes because it

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.360 
really like curling my lashes because it
kind<00:05:21.690> of<00:05:21.720> takes<00:05:21.960> too<00:05:22.140> long<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:22.979> really<00:05:23.160> gets

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
kind of takes too long so it really gets

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.760 
kind of takes too long so it really gets
it<00:05:23.580> like<00:05:23.760> arched<00:05:24.210> up<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.840> really<00:05:25.140> high<00:05:25.320> bulb

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
it like arched up and really high bulb

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.530 
it like arched up and really high bulb
at<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.130> same<00:05:26.280> time<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.669> makes<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.910> really<00:05:27.240> bad

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
at the same time it makes it really bad

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.630 
at the same time it makes it really bad
eyes<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.200> then<00:05:28.650> other<00:05:28.890> favorites<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.490> mine

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
eyes and then other favorites of mine

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.180 
eyes and then other favorites of mine
are<00:05:29.729> voluminous<00:05:30.060> lashes<00:05:30.380> because<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.710> really

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
are voluminous lashes because it really

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.830 
are voluminous lashes because it really
does<00:05:32.460> make<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.760> difference<00:05:32.970> with<00:05:33.180> volume<00:05:33.600> and

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
does make a difference with volume and

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.980 
does make a difference with volume and
then<00:05:33.990> one<00:05:34.290> by<00:05:34.320> one<00:05:34.740> kind<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.280> D<00:05:36.120> clumps<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.750> if

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
then one by one kind of D clumps it if

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.750 
then one by one kind of D clumps it if
you're<00:05:37.140> laying<00:05:37.410> mascaras<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.550> want<00:05:38.700> to

you're laying mascaras and you want to

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.219 
you're laying mascaras and you want to
go<00:05:38.790> back<00:05:39.000> in<00:05:39.150> with<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:39.479> it<00:05:39.600> has<00:05:39.720> really<00:05:39.930> fine

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
go back in with it it has really fine

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.380 
go back in with it it has really fine
bristles<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.160> separates<00:05:41.970> all<00:05:42.210> your

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
bristles and it separates all your
