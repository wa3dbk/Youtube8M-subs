this<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:42.690> niece's<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> reason<00:00:43.680> being

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this in my niece's from the reason being

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760 
this in my niece's from the reason being
is<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.129> well<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.079> have<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> wii<00:00:46.379> I've<00:00:46.620> never

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is because well I have a wii I've never

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
is because well I have a wii I've never
tested<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> wii<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.840> hardware

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
tested this on the wii but the hardware

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
tested this on the wii but the hardware
seems<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> same<00:00:49.860> anyway<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.430> I'm

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
seems to be the same anyway so I'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850 
seems to be the same anyway so I'm
guessing<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.170> probably<00:00:52.410> work<00:00:52.649> with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
guessing that it will probably work with

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
guessing that it will probably work with
a<00:00:52.890> wii<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:54.050> just<00:00:55.050> plug<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> game<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.000> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
a wii but just plug the game in and the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.130 
a wii but just plug the game in and the
cool<00:00:57.210> Vantage<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> say<00:00:58.050> you're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
cool Vantage of this is say you're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.849 
cool Vantage of this is say you're
playing<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> game<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> kirby<00:00:59.250> game<00:00:59.480> and
