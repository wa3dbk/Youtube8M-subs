the<00:01:21.299> actual<00:01:21.780> emulator<00:01:22.200> isn't<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.770> for

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the actual emulator isn't really for

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.100 
the actual emulator isn't really for
consumers<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> play<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.270> Android<00:01:24.750> L<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
consumers to play with Android L but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.480 
consumers to play with Android L but
more<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.380> developers<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> test<00:01:26.250> out

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
more for developers to test out

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.280 
more for developers to test out
different<00:01:26.630> applications<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.840> different

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
different applications and different

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.990 
different applications and different
settings<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.909> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

old-looking<00:01:30.390> icons<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> old-looking
