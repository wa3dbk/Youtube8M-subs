 with the triggers and everything has 20 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.200
 vibration nostra you accelerate in another 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.059
 vibration on the one hand in this not because 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.239
 it's the quito more than anything to have more 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.800
 precision now that they are shooting me 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.750

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.799

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.799

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.300

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.819

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.650
 like a motorbike 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.909

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.909

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.760
 well it goes very smooth it shows that this game 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.810
 It is designed to be a ostia 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.139
 bullet uncle 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.889
 with the ms of that pull has to change 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.889
 the uncle range 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.910

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.920
 backup has just come out there 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.100
 I do not think I'm very pro because I really do not 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.100
 I am 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.570

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.550
 to provoke but that provided the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.060
 simple that you have to from that payment the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.060
 side 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.440
 perfect 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.590

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.540
 I hate how the mss goes, I have to try it 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.620
 because it kills his way he will take away the 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.620
 range in future updates 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.860

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:23.110
