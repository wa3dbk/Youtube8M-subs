00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 with the onset of winter, private owners 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.220
 houses will face the problem of freezing 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 water pipes and solutions to this 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.250
 questions by traditional methods sometimes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.360
 just impossible and meanwhile 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 modern building technologies 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 offer an easy way to protect liquid 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 heat insulation but can thin layer 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.609
 paint replace a thick layer 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.279
 thermal insulation materials 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 let's look at the seventies 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.160
 last century in the laboratories of us and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 new developments were underway 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.730
 heat insulating material it should 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 was protect the surface of the cosmic 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 ships from thermal radiation 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.830
 requirements were strict to scientists 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 only ninety managed to solve the problem 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 the sixth year of the ship of the series was shaking with 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.320
 applied to the plating details of the liquid 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.320
 thermal insulation made a successful flight 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.230
 Marina Kuzmicheva faced with 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.090
 the problem of protecting the water supply for half a year 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.360
 back in the summer her family moved to a new 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 house 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 and in the winter it ended unexpectedly 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.660
 water the problem turned out to be commonplace 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 basement frozen water pipe 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.969
 defrosted with a hairdryer tried somehow 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 to insulate but that insulation which we 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.579
 owned success we did not bring here 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.620
 heard about the liquid 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.299
 inhalation experts say that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.189
 liquid insulation in which 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.689
 glass microspheres with air included 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.460
 silicone beads and acrylic dispersions 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.320
 low thermal conductivity 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 will be able to save from the cold as well 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.040
 mineral wool but we decided to check 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.049
 theory in practice for experiment we 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.060
 take two glass bottles recall 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.340
 their water and one of them we shall cover with liquid 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.880
 thermal insulation then put the pub in 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.880
 freezer 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.590
 average air temperature in january 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.270
 Volga region minus 12 15 degrees 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 freezer to the beginning of the experiment 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.659
 was about twenty we turned 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.549
 the minimum regulator at which 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.440
 the temperature should have dropped to 30 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.970
 degrees of frost and in such conditions 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.970
 left the bottle for exactly an hour 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.430
 buildings floors are warmed like 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.890
 insulation of piping Destra Do 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.810
 water supply in the scope of the house 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 liquid insulation quite widely on 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.230
 before using it is necessary 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.790
 specialist advice otherwise belief in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.599
 miracles can turn bitter 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.599
 disappointment
