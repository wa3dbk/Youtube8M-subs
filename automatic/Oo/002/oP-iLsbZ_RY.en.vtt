00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
release with the index finger what will

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.010 
release with the index finger what will
happen<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.430> pencil<00:02:22.880> will<00:02:23.480> spin

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
happen then is that the pencil will spin

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:33.910 
happen then is that the pencil will spin
around<00:02:24.970> your<00:02:25.970> thumb<00:02:27.700> look<00:02:31.989> right<00:02:32.989> now<00:02:33.739> if<00:02:33.830> you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
around your thumb look right now if you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.449 
around your thumb look right now if you
do<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.190> too<00:02:34.340> fast<00:02:34.610> or<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.720> push<00:02:35.930> too<00:02:36.170> hard

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
do it too fast or if you push too hard

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.570 
do it too fast or if you push too hard
here's<00:02:37.459> what<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:37.700> happen<00:02:38.980> yet<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.190> that's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
here's what will happen yet see that's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.690 
here's what will happen yet see that's
no<00:02:40.790> good<00:02:40.970> nobody<00:02:41.900> wants<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.220> again<00:02:43.310> it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
no good nobody wants that so again it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.479 
no good nobody wants that so again it's
very<00:02:43.850> very<00:02:44.330> lightly<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.769> enough<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.340> make

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
very very lightly just enough to make

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.420 
very very lightly just enough to make
the<00:02:46.610> pencil<00:02:46.850> move<00:02:47.239> around<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.959> thumb<00:02:48.430> now

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the pencil move around the thumb now

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.520 
the pencil move around the thumb now
when<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.670> do<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:50.140> something<00:02:51.140> else<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.380> want

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
when you do that something else you want

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.680 
when you do that something else you want
to<00:02:51.590> keep<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.890> mind<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> make<00:02:53.030> sure<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
to keep in mind is to make sure that the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.949 
to keep in mind is to make sure that the
pencil<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:55.660> parallel<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.170> floor<00:02:57.730> okay<00:02:58.730> or

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
pencil is parallel to the floor okay or

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.120 
pencil is parallel to the floor okay or
parallel<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> table<00:03:00.410> whatever<00:03:00.860> surface

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
parallel to the table whatever surface

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.400 
parallel to the table whatever surface
you're<00:03:01.430> working<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.660> want<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> pencil

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
you're working on so you want the pencil

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.250 
you're working on so you want the pencil
and<00:03:03.590> that's<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.310> third<00:03:04.489> point<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:05.090> keep<00:03:06.080> in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and that's the third point to keep in

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.199 
and that's the third point to keep in
mind<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.160> want<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.430> pencil<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.090> be

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
mind is that you want the pencil to be

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.560 
mind is that you want the pencil to be
positioned<00:03:08.870> correctly<00:03:09.910> okay<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.180> want<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.420> to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
positioned correctly okay you want it to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.840 
positioned correctly okay you want it to
be<00:03:11.720> oriented<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.799> traveling<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> horizontal

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
be oriented in traveling on a horizontal

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.160 
be oriented in traveling on a horizontal
axis<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:15.530> on<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.250> vertical<00:03:16.880> axis<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:18.019> let's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
axis not on a vertical axis so let's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.920 
axis not on a vertical axis so let's
review<00:03:18.820> finger<00:03:19.820> positioning<00:03:21.250> pressure<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
review finger positioning pressure and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.930 
review finger positioning pressure and
then<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.049> spin<00:03:24.350> has<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.040> horizontal

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
then the spin has to be in a horizontal

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.220 
then the spin has to be in a horizontal
motion<00:03:26.590> all<00:03:27.590> right<00:03:27.739> now<00:03:27.860> beyond<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
motion all right now beyond that you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.069 
motion all right now beyond that you
pretty<00:03:30.500> much<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:30.739> practice<00:03:31.900> until<00:03:32.900> you've

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
pretty much just practice until you've

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.280 
pretty much just practice until you've
got<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.940> helicopter<00:03:35.570> trick<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.079> want

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
got it the helicopter trick and you want

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.810 
got it the helicopter trick and you want
some<00:03:36.470> other<00:03:36.590> way<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.799> completely<00:03:37.400> waste<00:03:37.610> your

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
some other way to completely waste your

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.990 
some other way to completely waste your
time<00:03:37.970> here's<00:03:38.950> another<00:03:39.950> one<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.400> think<00:03:40.910> this

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
time here's another one I think this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.060 
time here's another one I think this
one's<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.239> little<00:03:41.269> harder<00:03:41.750> actually<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.920> I

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
one's a little harder actually and I

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.479 
one's a little harder actually and I
guess<00:03:43.310> we<00:03:43.519> should<00:03:43.700> call<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.560> don't<00:03:45.560> know<00:03:45.829> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
guess we should call it I don't know the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.759 
guess we should call it I don't know the
propeller<00:03:46.910> trick<00:03:47.299> that's<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.410> good<00:03:48.650> name

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
propeller trick that's not a good name

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.080 
propeller trick that's not a good name
because<00:03:49.100> that's<00:03:49.190> not<00:03:49.400> actually<00:03:49.790> what<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.000> even

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
because that's not actually what it even

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.120 
because that's not actually what it even
looks<00:03:50.360> like<00:03:50.570> but<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.989> don't<00:03:51.530> know<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:51.860> don't<00:03:52.040> have

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
looks like but I don't know I don't have

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.009 
looks like but I don't know I don't have
a<00:03:52.190> good<00:03:52.310> name<00:03:52.459> for<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.760> again<00:03:53.630> we'll<00:03:53.810> start

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
a good name for it again we'll start

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.960 
a good name for it again we'll start
with<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.170> basic<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.739> here's<00:03:55.700> what<00:03:55.850> you<00:03:55.940> need

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
with the basic so here's what you need

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.830 
with the basic so here's what you need
to<00:03:56.120> do<00:03:57.610> first<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:58.880> when<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.480> start<00:03:59.750> with

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
to do first of all when you start with

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.140 
to do first of all when you start with
your<00:03:59.989> hand<00:04:00.170> put<00:04:01.040> your<00:04:01.070> hand<00:04:01.370> straight<00:04:01.699> out<00:04:01.820> so

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
your hand put your hand straight out so

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.689 
your hand put your hand straight out so
that<00:04:02.299> it's<00:04:02.419> parallel<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.440> floor<00:04:03.739> your

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
that it's parallel to the floor your

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.309 
that it's parallel to the floor your
thumb<00:04:05.030> will<00:04:05.209> stick<00:04:05.419> out<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.780> roughly<00:04:06.079> or

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
thumb will stick out it roughly or

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.319 
thumb will stick out it roughly or
right<00:04:06.439> angle<00:04:06.799> from<00:04:07.099> the<00:04:07.939> rest<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.209> your

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
right angle from the rest of your

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.729 
right angle from the rest of your
fingers<00:04:08.810> good<00:04:09.609> yeah<00:04:10.609> just<00:04:10.939> like<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.739> all

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
fingers good yeah just like that all

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.739 
fingers good yeah just like that all
right<00:04:12.799> then<00:04:13.639> what<00:04:13.819> you<00:04:13.939> want<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.180> do<00:04:14.389> is

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:14.749 
right then what you want to do is

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.390 
right then what you want to do is
position<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.439> pencil<00:04:15.769> on<00:04:15.829> your<00:04:15.920> hand<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.370> that

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
position the pencil on your hand so that

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.759 
position the pencil on your hand so that
the<00:04:16.699> eraser<00:04:17.150> rests<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.049> web<00:04:18.259> where<00:04:18.620> your

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
the eraser rests in the web where your

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.600 
the eraser rests in the web where your
thumb<00:04:19.039> and<00:04:19.340> fingers<00:04:20.299> meet<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:20.930> your<00:04:21.109> hand<00:04:21.320> and

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
thumb and fingers meet on your hand and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.330 
thumb and fingers meet on your hand and
so<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.030> pencil<00:04:23.210> also<00:04:23.930> lays<00:04:24.199> across<00:04:24.650> your

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
so that the pencil also lays across your

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.360 
so that the pencil also lays across your
hand<00:04:26.259> finally<00:04:27.259> ending<00:04:27.650> where<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.099> middle

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
hand finally ending where the middle

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.020 
hand finally ending where the middle
finger<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.419> ring<00:04:29.449> finger<00:04:29.660> come<00:04:30.289> together

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
finger and the ring finger come together

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.870 
finger and the ring finger come together
now<00:04:32.030> that's<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.169> finger<00:04:33.410> position<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:34.699> the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
now that's the finger position is the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.430 
now that's the finger position is the
next<00:04:35.120> part<00:04:35.270> pressure<00:04:35.630> this<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.199> little

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
next part pressure this is a little

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.560 
next part pressure this is a little
tricky<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.490> pressure<00:04:37.789> from<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.240> trick<00:04:38.539> to

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
tricky the pressure from this trick to

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.570 
tricky the pressure from this trick to
make<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.990> pencil<00:04:39.259> spin<00:04:39.860> or<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.310> make<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
make the pencil spin or to make the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.029 
make the pencil spin or to make the
pencil<00:04:40.789> move<00:04:41.180> comes<00:04:41.900> from<00:04:42.229> applying<00:04:42.620> pressure

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
pencil move comes from applying pressure

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.159 
pencil move comes from applying pressure
from<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.610> middle<00:04:43.940> finger<00:04:44.240> okay

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
from the middle finger okay

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.900 
from the middle finger okay
so<00:04:45.680> you're<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.009> with<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.669> middle

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
so you're going to with the middle

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.450 
so you're going to with the middle
finger<00:04:47.150> sort<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.960> push<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.530> towards<00:04:49.190> your

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
finger sort of push it towards your

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.810 
finger sort of push it towards your
pinky<00:04:49.940> finger<00:04:50.259> then<00:04:51.259> you'll<00:04:51.470> release<00:04:51.830> with

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
pinky finger then you'll release with

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.439 
pinky finger then you'll release with
your<00:04:53.030> thumb<00:04:53.330> when<00:04:54.139> that<00:04:54.320> happens<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.970> pencil

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
your thumb when that happens the pencil

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.779 
your thumb when that happens the pencil
will<00:04:56.870> actually<00:04:57.289> pivot<00:04:57.740> around<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.550> middle

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
will actually pivot around the middle

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.960 
will actually pivot around the middle
finger<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> be<00:04:59.990> held<00:05:00.289> in<00:05:00.590> check<00:05:01.250> from<00:05:01.550> flying

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
finger and be held in check from flying

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.450 
finger and be held in check from flying
into<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.449> air<00:05:02.479> by<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.500> joining<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:04.130> your

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
into the air by the joining of your

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.520 
into the air by the joining of your
index<00:05:04.820> finger<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.389> your<00:05:06.070> in<00:05:07.070> ring<00:05:07.580> finger

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
index finger and your in ring finger

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.770 
index finger and your in ring finger
yeah<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.800> know<00:05:10.099> that's<00:05:10.340> confusing<00:05:10.849> here<00:05:11.539> watch

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
yeah I know that's confusing here watch

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.999 
yeah I know that's confusing here watch
I'll<00:05:12.110> demonstrate<00:05:17.289> yeah<00:05:18.289> I<00:05:18.500> know<00:05:18.770> that's<00:05:18.949> a

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
I'll demonstrate yeah I know that's a

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.920 
I'll demonstrate yeah I know that's a
little<00:05:19.099> confusing<00:05:19.360> I'll<00:05:20.360> do<00:05:20.659> it<00:05:20.750> in<00:05:20.840> slow

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
little confusing I'll do it in slow

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.700 
little confusing I'll do it in slow
motion<00:05:21.020> now

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.140 

well<00:05:27.280> there<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:28.000> go<00:05:28.560> again<00:05:29.940> same<00:05:30.940> process

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
well there you go again same process

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.529 
well there you go again same process
here<00:05:31.780> finger<00:05:32.350> positioning<00:05:33.539> applying

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
here finger positioning applying

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.510 
here finger positioning applying
pressure<00:05:34.840> this<00:05:35.770> time<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.280> middle

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
pressure this time with the middle

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.240 
pressure this time with the middle
finger<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:37.500> then<00:05:38.500> you<00:05:38.650> want<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.860> make<00:05:38.979> sure

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
finger and then you want to make sure

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.100 
finger and then you want to make sure
that<00:05:39.460> as<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.759> pencil<00:05:40.150> travels<00:05:40.600> to<00:05:40.780> keep<00:05:40.960> from

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
that as the pencil travels to keep from

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.600 
that as the pencil travels to keep from
going<00:05:41.259> completely<00:05:41.530> out<00:05:41.889> of<00:05:41.919> control<00:05:42.370> you

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
going completely out of control you

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.760 
going completely out of control you
bring<00:05:42.850> together<00:05:43.000> your<00:05:43.810> index<00:05:44.229> finger<00:05:44.590> and

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
bring together your index finger and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.400 
bring together your index finger and
your<00:05:45.250> ring<00:05:45.280> finger

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
your ring finger

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.409 
your ring finger
finally<00:05:47.410> I<00:05:47.530> suppose<00:05:48.009> you<00:05:48.520> could<00:05:48.759> walk<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.270> from

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
finally I suppose you could walk it from

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.420 
finally I suppose you could walk it from
the<00:05:49.570> ring<00:05:49.750> finger<00:05:50.199> to<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.650> middle<00:05:50.889> finger<00:05:51.250> and

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
the ring finger to the middle finger and

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.490 
the ring finger to the middle finger and
then<00:05:51.669> end<00:05:51.880> with<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.210> helicopter<00:05:52.720> trick<00:05:52.960> let's

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
then end with the helicopter trick let's

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.800 
then end with the helicopter trick let's
see<00:05:53.620> what<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:53.740> looks<00:05:53.979> like<00:05:56.789> yeah<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:58.000> know<00:05:58.120> I'm

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
see what that looks like yeah I know I'm

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.260 
see what that looks like yeah I know I'm
not<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.229> impressed<00:05:59.560> either<00:06:00.210> all<00:06:01.210> right

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
not that impressed either all right

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.370 
not that impressed either all right
there<00:06:01.930> you<00:06:01.960> go

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
there you go
