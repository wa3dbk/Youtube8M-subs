my hair grows naturally pretty fast but

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.850 
my hair grows naturally pretty fast but
i<00:04:42.940> was<00:04:43.270> talking<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.840> my<00:04:43.930> hairstylist<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
i was talking to my hairstylist and I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.170 
i was talking to my hairstylist and I
was<00:04:44.979> like<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.160> want<00:04:45.310> my<00:04:45.460> hair<00:04:45.580> grow<00:04:45.789> faster<00:04:46.150> and

was like I want my hair grow faster and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
she recommended this so the reason I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.820 
she recommended this so the reason I
like<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.150> because<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:50.199> the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
like this is because this is the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.810 
like this is because this is the
conditioner<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.970> this<00:04:52.570> which<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.229> my
