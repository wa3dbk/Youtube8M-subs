00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
Islanders coming in dead last again have

the<00:00:44.670> Rangers<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.960> think

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the Rangers first just because I think

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
the Rangers first just because I think
their<00:00:46.320> attack<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.460> improved<00:00:47.640> even

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
their attack is much improved even

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.970 
their attack is much improved even
though<00:00:48.570> Brad<00:00:48.750> Richards<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.680> great

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
though Brad Richards is in that great

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.700 
though Brad Richards is in that great
but<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:51.149> think<00:00:51.809> their<00:00:51.899> attacks<00:00:52.140> improved<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
but I think their attacks improved and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
but I think their attacks improved and
their<00:00:52.829> defense<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> goaltending<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.699> always

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
their defense and goaltending is always

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
their defense and goaltending is always
pretty<00:00:54.059> solid<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> without<00:00:55.050> Crosby<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pretty solid and without Crosby the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.369 
pretty solid and without Crosby the
penguins<00:00:56.070> aren't<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.550> good<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.170> could<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
penguins aren't as good as they could be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
penguins aren't as good as they could be
to<00:00:58.770> win<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> Atlantic<00:00:59.309> Division<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.539> next<00:01:00.719> we

the<00:01:51.810> Northwest<00:01:52.409> Division<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the Northwest Division I think this is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.310 
the Northwest Division I think this is
probably<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.180> most<00:01:54.270> mediocre<00:01:54.659> division<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
probably the most mediocre division in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
probably the most mediocre division in
the<00:01:55.409> entire<00:01:55.619> league<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> sounds<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the entire league so it sounds kind of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.600 
the entire league so it sounds kind of
easy<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> call<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.770> cops<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.189> definitely<00:01:59.520> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
easy to call the cops are definitely in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.399 
easy to call the cops are definitely in
a<00:01:59.670> witness<00:01:59.909> division<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.750> every<00:02:01.110> other

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
a witness division because every other

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670 
a witness division because every other
team<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> pretty<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.939> useless<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
team is pretty much useless the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
team is pretty much useless the
Minnesota<00:02:05.009> Wild<00:02:05.159> i<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.820> second<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.420> think

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
Minnesota Wild i put in second I think

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 
Minnesota Wild i put in second I think
they'll<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.290> okay<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.489> great<00:02:08.700> I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
they'll do okay but not that great I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.100 
they'll do okay but not that great I
actually<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> oiler

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually have the oiler

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100 
actually have the oiler
coming<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.470> third<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:12.570> now<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.840> their

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
coming in third I think now that their

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.630 
coming in third I think now that their
kids<00:02:13.320> are<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> year<00:02:13.680> older<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.460> they're

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
kids are a year older that they're

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.010 
kids are a year older that they're
they're<00:02:14.880> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.330> better<00:02:15.630> they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
they're going to be a little better they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
they're going to be a little better they
were<00:02:16.080> kind<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.350> promising<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> beginning

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
were kind of promising in the beginning

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.730 
were kind of promising in the beginning
of<00:02:17.280> last<00:02:17.460> season<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.720> I've<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.410> them<00:02:19.560> actually

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
of last season so I've got them actually

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.040 
of last season so I've got them actually
coming<00:02:20.010> third<00:02:20.420> over<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.570> Colorado<00:02:21.960> Avalanche

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
coming third over the Colorado Avalanche

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.500 
coming third over the Colorado Avalanche
only<00:02:22.830> because<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.310> don't<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:23.850> trust<00:02:24.240> their

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
only because I don't really trust their

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.030 
only because I don't really trust their
goaltending<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.800> think

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
goaltending that much and I think

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
goaltending that much and I think
they're<00:02:26.250> they're<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.210> rebuild<00:02:27.600> too

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they're they're kind of in a rebuild too

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.200 
they're they're kind of in a rebuild too
and<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> calgary<00:02:29.310> flames<00:02:29.400> coming<00:02:30.120> in

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
and I have the calgary flames coming in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.140 
and I have the calgary flames coming in
last<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:31.020> i<00:02:31.800> don't<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.850> they're<00:02:33.120> just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
last because i don't know they're just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
last because i don't know they're just
old<00:02:33.480> they're<00:02:33.960> slow<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.530> i<00:02:34.980> don't<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.250> i'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
old they're slow and i don't think i'm

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.410 
old they're slow and i don't think i'm
gonna<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:35.610> able<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.880> keep<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
gonna be able to keep up to this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.860 
gonna be able to keep up to this
division<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.350> them<00:02:37.500> coming<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.890> last

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
division so have them coming in last

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
division so have them coming in last
finally<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.260> Pacific<00:02:40.830> Division<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
finally I have the Pacific Division I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.850

think<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> hardest<00:02:42.450> division<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
think this is the hardest division to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.990 
think this is the hardest division to
call<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> entire<00:02:44.490> National<00:02:44.910> Hockey
