00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:10.840
 bigger beautiful again, it's worth looking at 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.639
 It is especially this recipe 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.960
 to look at I want to do that 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.230
 a garlic konfi that means we 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.080
 make this garlic durable and 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.029
 would cook in oil 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.330
 while the garlic loses its 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.790
 intense severe smell again from 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.650
 some people are not claimed 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.239
 because sometimes I also like her 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.289
 but this is it 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.199
 It will also suit every garlic like that 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:46.059
 convincing namely really cute and 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.870
 We can see the education of 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.809
 swarm and he will not be without anymore 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 can live if that tried once 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:01.379
 has we pay more and want to catch 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.969
 Need for our garlic policy 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.969
 garlic and olive oil 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.570
 it is heated to 80 degrees and this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.740
 height was also used for grill meat 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.380
 that's not it then yes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.689
 it really is going to be too 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.759
 to use cook 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:30.189
 I have 600 grams of organic garlic here 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.820
 it is even better if you fresh 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.220
 Garlic boys take garlic when you go 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.869
 Which one gets hope that you have to 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.810
 no 600 chambers 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.159
 since only 200 camera could be important 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.960
 It is with a view to the courtyard but 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.009
 Two meters long we have each one here 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.950
 A lot to do 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.610
 to peel those ten and there I have 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.140
 ever an idea and we catch because 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.039
 then we have our garlic 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.380
 garlic bulbs as the cd singles 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.760
 again in 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:17.459
 7 being each other's life 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.459
 and before 16 see it nationwide 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.760
 I do not have to do that right now 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.700
 Show me all the crests 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.260
 That 's why I want to go to my darling 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.450
 continue 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.020
 We have now bought the club 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.270
 we have isolated in this one 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.950
 moment to change such a seven meters 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.220
 I think it is important that it 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.650
 as metal is and there we have a lot 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.489
 to steal the last garlic 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:53.170
 at least place it and that helps 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.140
 to peel us the possible and now the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.200
 you only as you see cooking completely 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.959
 ordinary water dripped and there do 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.650
 I now use the garlic with his pc 23 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.170
 seconds 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.880
 I 'm comfortable with that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.410
 can look exactly and then immediately cold 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.200
 Rinse with cold water because yes 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.959
 just help because better 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.750
 i have draw is by the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.570
 lowered with cold water of course 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.519
 There are garlic on the top 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.540
 cloth spread that fast 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.100
 that cools the tourism or even one 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 if you were not deterred 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 and now let's put it now 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.000
 the garlic steal wonderfully and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.700
 today's silence here we envy 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.430
 just from looking so our income from 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.820
 Every amount of garlic is what you do 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.820
 Do not look that there is not a thing 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.690
 it's tuned and that's also dry because 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.900
 now customers in oil gave and we see 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.180
 a lot of things are shells and those are the ones 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.420
 what have quirks or order 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.700
 these four months 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.430
 because it is also a bit durable 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.260
 should have been as I said it was 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.750
 initially 600 grams 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.540
 Of course you can only 200 grams 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.480
 but he would make 10 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.810
 that certainly not much more 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.010
 makes and now you go create inherits 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.710
 get a fitting pot on and 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.880
 fill the garlic we make the stove 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.720
 Of course not yet 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.050
 and now we will do that with oil 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.120
 refill canon 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.990
 Of course you can I have here and 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.940
 ran in oil 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.770
 Of course you can also sunflower oil 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.950
 take or rapeseed oil there you are allowed 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.800
 choose what is sympathetic to you 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.919
 now the pot follows so far that the 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.320
 garlic is covered and then can us 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.360
 can be good times and make the herd 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.110
 At first we heat up the oil 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.560
 a temperature and wait until there is something 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.740
 temperature has now rise small 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.010
 bubble up that means oil has 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.010
 already reasonably temperature and now 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:32.090
 we set up the stove top 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:36.320
 small towns stage and leave now 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:40.010
 We slow down 45 minutes 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.650
 simon our garlic and how about 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.010
 now finished it shows the 540 minutes 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.960
 well worth it and i have one like that 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.210
 thermometer used that I always 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.669
 It could become temperature control 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.180
 rather 80 degrees have something over 80 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.990
 Degree 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.020
 if you do not have a thermometer then 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.270
 must have to do so that even 10 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.900
 minutes the stove and small protection level 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.060
 power and then 14 minutes out 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.760
 But let the pressure on more 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.810
 and then ten minutes again and 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.490
 after 45 minutes it is ready when 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.229
 of course you pull a thermometer and 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.599
 exactly at the 80 degrees are reached 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.830
 then you can switch off or too 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:28.340
 let and so you get to the goal it 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:31.070
 should not be too hot should not 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.220
 his degree over 90 and it was my 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.000
 experience cooking the garlic 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.830
 and face it to them for that 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.830
 and the wind range up 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.080
 Now I want you to 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.840
 Consistency of garlic has here 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.390
 one quite casually to press right music 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:03.200
 he will be easy then too 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:11.370
 on the bread with a bit of salt pepper and 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:17.670
 tomato it really gorgeous and you see 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:21.300
 tastes really sweet so terrific 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:23.520
 Look at our finished result from me 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.330
 I'm sure it will be you too 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.060
 excite 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.750
 I wish you much success 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.750
 imitate
