00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.700
 from the hand of entertainment 2 comes this 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.380
 empire colonists a game with a 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.629
 casual headline really is a 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.920
 almost card game that will allow us 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.080
 will manage the available resources 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.640
 to create our great empire or 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.010
 show that we are better than 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.300
 others with four possible civilizations 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 let's open the box to see what it contains 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 we open the box of settlers of the empire 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.869
 big fence for this game and we have 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.579
 So here is a little leaf with a 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.070
 barcode three of these to go 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.350
 the web actually imagine what I will 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.809
 try it very large manual occupies all the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.449
 box without a very defined cover but 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.440
 that you can see with many illustrations 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.090
 good 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 ideal to learn to play have 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.649
 quite a letter 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 and in the end summary of the rules something 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.750
 that is usually very useful is a couple of the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 UFW carton blank sheets say 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.290
 because I know about this that solving for 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.790
 they have 500 very large chips that 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.180
 they are for the Egyptian civilizations 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.369
 barbarians because there are more chips under the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 second if Japanese brothers with more 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.420
 chips are not from these chips so long 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.360
 that having them in one's hand destroys 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.119
 zones a board that apparently is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.390
 score is a bunch of fixed letters 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.700
 attack letters very illustrated the very 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.979
 chulas vale are carp size letter 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.560
 standard letters for the Romans in red 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.030
 letters are also quite illustrated 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030
 for the Japanese and purple 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.270
 and letters for the barbarians in color 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.820
 green 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.280
 and in the other deck, but more than 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.020

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.390
 you are with the house in color as blue 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 are the standard letters or let's say for 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.469
 all players common cards that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.940
 like beige and text 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.810
 and finally the last but almost stretches 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.659
 detailed sachets that we have here 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.769

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.710
 trunks of wood or one stops so that
