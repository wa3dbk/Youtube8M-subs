00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Including 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.930
 I think that the bow would like to talk about Eve 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.090
 The long sea is always on playing the plum grove 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:20.320
 It is one of the things we have to think about 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.320
 Please be aware of the distribution of the bow from the initial stage to the first 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.220
 Well Mido 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.970
 12 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.340
 When you stretch 200 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:49.360
 Please be aware of the middle of my finger before this 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.360
 Let's be conscious as saying that the chairman is half 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.620
 goo 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.830
 yeah 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.030
 me 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.049
 m 5 minutes 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.049
 Tape to prevent conscious hope of the san expressed In to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.030
 It is likely that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.510
 yeah 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 yeah 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.550
 In 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:42.500
 Put away blow using now to about one half more than 3 minutes 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.500
 This is a typical pattern 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.010
 2 minutes attention 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.480
 1 minute 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:58.070
 It was still about placing the body use many later using less anymore 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.070
 That the Tteyuu 5 episode of the main in Then bow is easier born good results 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.760
 dare 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 yeah 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 yeah 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
 Hm 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.030
 But even if it becomes a difficult song bow distribution 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.030
 Is very important 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.280
 me 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:44.550
 5 minutes of Would you know what was year issue fingers 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.550
 In the fact that the sound appears in the inside early by the shooting iron 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.970
 Eeeeeee 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.920
 Good 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.140
 Now 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.780
 There is a seed in one night and so on 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.710
 The 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.900
 I am here 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.990
 Half of 200 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.920
 The corner 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.920
 The wind say half 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.319
 This far hum ah 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.140
 Haha 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.810
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.349
 In the wind 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.349
 And it will have to leave the bow that is later 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.480
 Together with others 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.510
 There is no problem at all for what remains behind 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.510
 2 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.800
 If left behind 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.210
 You can do enough for the expression 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.210
 So later processing is also a translation 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.580
 It is easier if you put up with it first 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.180
 In the distribution of the sea 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.579
 I know the rack after a minimum patience 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:25.800
 First after Kamimachi 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.800
 I think that goes well when considered in a little deal saving Fu Tteyuu to the chin
