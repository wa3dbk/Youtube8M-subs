00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you end up in this cave so now we're

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.560 
you end up in this cave so now we're
gonna<00:01:17.250> try<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> explosive<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
there we go thrown ground but that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
there we go thrown ground but that
explosion<00:01:25.830> goes<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.080> body

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
explosion goes off and you see some body

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
explosion goes off and you see some body
part<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.520> fly<00:01:29.729> around

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
part see they kind of just fly around

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
part see they kind of just fly around
there<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:31.020> he's<00:01:31.140> still<00:01:31.350> standing<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.040> he's

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
there but he's still standing but he's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
there but he's still standing but he's
like<00:01:32.250> frozen<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.500> killed<00:01:34.799> him<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.990> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
like frozen so it killed him but it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.420 
like frozen so it killed him but it
guess<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> glitched<00:01:37.590> him<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.009> well

so<00:01:54.180> yeah<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.570> odd<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.649> weird

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
so yeah a bit odd right bit weird

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.370 
so yeah a bit odd right bit weird
so<00:01:58.800> my<00:01:59.700> advice<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.510> now<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> bomb<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
so my advice for now and the bomb is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
so my advice for now and the bomb is
that<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> wild<00:02:02.400> card

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that it's a bit of a wild card

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
that it's a bit of a wild card
so<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.080> know<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.680> use<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.130> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
so you know if you're gonna use it just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.460 
so you know if you're gonna use it just
be<00:02:05.550> careful<00:02:05.580> because<00:02:06.300> it's<00:02:06.630> not<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:07.230> know<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
be careful because it's not you know it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.320 
be careful because it's not you know it
might<00:02:07.620> end<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.950> getting<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> killed<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
might end up getting you killed you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.550 
might end up getting you killed you
might<00:02:09.510> be<00:02:09.630> better<00:02:09.780> off<00:02:09.869> sticking<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.380> more

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
might be better off sticking to more

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
might be better off sticking to more
traditional<00:02:10.740> weapons<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.700> fight<00:02:12.540> off<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
tribesman next on the itinerary is the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.280 
tribesman next on the itinerary is the

I<00:03:20.070> assume<00:03:20.610> we're<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.090> bit<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.300> water

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I assume we're in a little bit of water

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.930 
I assume we're in a little bit of water
which<00:03:22.560> means<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.980> completely<00:03:23.400> negates<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
which means it completely negates the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.630 
which means it completely negates the
effect<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.930> flare<00:03:25.140> gun<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.920> if<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.459> get

weapon<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.780> use<00:05:18.900> against<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.169> tribesmen<00:05:19.800> I

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
weapon to use against the tribesmen I

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.409 
weapon to use against the tribesmen I
found<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.490> axe<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.970> get<00:05:21.150> off<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.389> plane

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
found that the axe you get off the plane

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.690 
found that the axe you get off the plane
is<00:05:21.840> actually<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:22.530> fact<00:05:22.680> stronger<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.400> my

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
is actually in fact stronger in my

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.170 
is actually in fact stronger in my
experience<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.979> only<00:05:26.220> craftable<00:05:26.729> armour

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
experience and the only craftable armour

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.659 
experience and the only craftable armour
at<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> moment<00:05:27.690> is<00:05:27.810> with<00:05:28.470> lizard<00:05:28.919> skin<00:05:29.250> which

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
at the moment is with lizard skin which

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.040 
at the moment is with lizard skin which
isn't<00:05:29.880> really<00:05:30.000> craftable<00:05:30.510> actually<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.020> just

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
isn't really craftable actually you just

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.050 
isn't really craftable actually you just
kill<00:05:31.590> lizard<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.130> then<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.400> right-click<00:05:32.700> the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
kill lizard and then you right-click the

them you can look around the plane they
are<00:05:57.270> kind<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.630> all<00:05:57.750> over<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.020> island<00:05:58.440> but

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
are kind of all over the island but

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.010 
are kind of all over the island but
they're<00:05:58.800> much<00:05:58.979> easier<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.430> spot<00:05:59.789> in<00:06:00.030> areas

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
they're much easier to spot in areas

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.020 
they're much easier to spot in areas
that<00:06:01.050> are<00:06:01.229> just<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.530> lot<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.680> brown<00:06:02.160> in<00:06:02.580> them

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
that are just a lot of brown in them

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.360 
that are just a lot of brown in them
such<00:06:03.780> as<00:06:03.990> around<00:06:04.349> the<00:06:04.530> plane<00:06:04.770> one<00:06:05.130> of<00:06:05.280> the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
such as around the plane one of the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.820 
such as around the plane one of the
locations<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.210> spear<00:06:06.539> is<00:06:06.690> just<00:06:07.530> this

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
locations of the spear is just this

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.339 
locations of the spear is just this
beach<00:06:08.099> here<00:06:08.370> you<00:06:09.090> can<00:06:09.240> find<00:06:09.419> it<00:06:09.630> just<00:06:09.840> jutting

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
beach here you can find it just jutting

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.620 
beach here you can find it just jutting
out<00:06:10.560> of<00:06:10.710> this<00:06:10.800> guy's<00:06:10.979> sleeping<00:06:11.190> bag<00:06:11.520> there<00:06:12.510> are

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
out of this guy's sleeping bag there are

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.029 
out of this guy's sleeping bag there are
many<00:06:12.810> places<00:06:13.169> where<00:06:13.530> you<00:06:13.590> can<00:06:13.800> find<00:06:13.979> the

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
many places where you can find the

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.500 
many places where you can find the
spirit<00:06:14.310> but<00:06:14.370> I<00:06:14.460> thought<00:06:14.610> this<00:06:14.820> was<00:06:15.030> just<00:06:15.060> the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
spirit but I thought this was just the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.300 
spirit but I thought this was just the
most<00:06:15.660> interesting<00:06:16.260> one<00:06:16.440> so<00:06:16.830> I<00:06:16.860> thought<00:06:17.160> I'd

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
most interesting one so I thought I'd

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.279 
most interesting one so I thought I'd
start<00:06:17.820> off<00:06:17.910> with<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.240> small<00:06:18.810> ponds<00:06:19.110> are

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
start off with that small ponds are

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.690 
start off with that small ponds are
typically<00:06:19.710> where<00:06:19.890> you<00:06:20.010> can<00:06:20.159> find<00:06:20.400> a<00:06:20.490> lot<00:06:20.669> of

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
typically where you can find a lot of

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.339 
typically where you can find a lot of
Spears<00:06:21.120> jutting<00:06:21.479> out<00:06:21.539> of<00:06:21.659> the<00:06:21.719> ground<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.169> as

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
Spears jutting out of the ground and as

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.630 
Spears jutting out of the ground and as
far<00:06:22.530> as<00:06:22.620> I<00:06:22.710> know<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.039> only<00:06:23.310> things<00:06:23.520> you

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
far as I know that the only things you

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.570 
far as I know that the only things you
can<00:06:23.789> actually

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
can actually

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.029 
can actually
fish<00:06:25.270> with<00:06:25.479> so<00:06:25.960> they're<00:06:26.259> very<00:06:26.289> handy<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:26.830> would

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
fish with so they're very handy I would

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.379 
fish with so they're very handy I would
not<00:06:27.250> recommend<00:06:27.460> trying<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.120> fight<00:06:28.270> the

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
not recommend trying to fight the

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.270 
not recommend trying to fight the
tribesmen<00:06:28.960> with<00:06:29.289> them<00:06:29.560> at<00:06:29.830> all

tribesmen with them at all

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.879 
tribesmen with them at all
and<00:06:31.000> last<00:06:31.300> but<00:06:31.389> not<00:06:31.539> least<00:06:31.810> is<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:32.080> rusty<00:06:32.740> axe

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
and last but not least is the rusty axe

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.350 
and last but not least is the rusty axe
which<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.310> could<00:06:33.460> find<00:06:33.669> invented<00:06:34.120> in<00:06:34.210> this

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
which you could find invented in this

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
out you can also just find it by finding

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.100 
out you can also just find it by finding
this<00:06:39.340> cave<00:06:39.580> there's<00:06:39.819> one<00:06:40.090> in<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.509> boards<00:06:40.870> that

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
this cave there's one in the boards that

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.860 
this cave there's one in the boards that
are<00:06:41.259> blocking<00:06:42.039> up<00:06:42.310> this<00:06:42.460> cave<00:06:42.759> and<00:06:43.120> you<00:06:43.720> can

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
are blocking up this cave and you can

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.839 
are blocking up this cave and you can
find<00:06:44.080> other<00:06:44.710> ones<00:06:44.889> around<00:06:45.129> the<00:06:45.280> island<00:06:45.639> if<00:06:45.729> I'm

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849

not mistaken your starter axe however is

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.180 
not mistaken your starter axe however is
stronger<00:06:49.780> than<00:06:49.960> this<00:06:50.080> one<00:06:50.319> if<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:50.889> am<00:06:51.039> not

stronger than this one if I am not

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.550 
stronger than this one if I am not
mistaken<00:06:51.340> so<00:06:51.909> just<00:06:52.780> try<00:06:53.050> to<00:06:53.080> stick<00:06:53.319> with<00:06:53.440> that

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
that this information you could probably

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.589 
that this information you could probably
find<00:07:02.800> pretty<00:07:02.979> easily<00:07:03.190> on<00:07:03.430> Wikipedia's<00:07:04.360> and

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 
find pretty easily on Wikipedia's and

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.570 
find pretty easily on Wikipedia's and
guides<00:07:04.750> now<00:07:05.110> but<00:07:05.380> when<00:07:05.740> I<00:07:05.770> started<00:07:06.220> it<00:07:06.400> there

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
guides now but when I started it there

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.159 
guides now but when I started it there
really<00:07:06.729> wasn't<00:07:06.970> that<00:07:07.090> much<00:07:07.270> information<00:07:07.539> and

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
really wasn't that much information and

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.189 
really wasn't that much information and
I'd<00:07:08.289> spent<00:07:08.650> like<00:07:08.860> 12<00:07:09.669> hours<00:07:09.930> actually<00:07:10.930> doing

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
I'd spent like 12 hours actually doing

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.870 
I'd spent like 12 hours actually doing
all<00:07:11.289> this<00:07:11.500> and<00:07:11.740> putting<00:07:11.949> it<00:07:12.039> all<00:07:12.130> together<00:07:12.250> so

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
all this and putting it all together so

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.279 
all this and putting it all together so
I<00:07:13.120> figured<00:07:13.599> I'd<00:07:13.659> just<00:07:13.810> throw<00:07:13.930> it<00:07:14.050> out<00:07:14.169> there

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.289 
I figured I'd just throw it out there

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.850 
I figured I'd just throw it out there
anyway<00:07:14.409> and<00:07:14.800> I<00:07:14.830> hope<00:07:14.949> it<00:07:15.130> helped<00:07:15.639> a<00:07:15.699> few<00:07:15.909> people

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
anyway and I hope it helped a few people

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.170 
anyway and I hope it helped a few people
I'm<00:07:17.860> sorry<00:07:18.069> about<00:07:18.219> the<00:07:18.370> editing<00:07:18.759> I<00:07:18.880> realized

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
I'm sorry about the editing I realized

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.200 
I'm sorry about the editing I realized
it<00:07:19.300> wasn't<00:07:19.449> the<00:07:19.569> best<00:07:19.750> but<00:07:20.620> I<00:07:21.159> couldn't<00:07:21.969> find<00:07:22.090> a

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
it wasn't the best but I couldn't find a

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.309 
it wasn't the best but I couldn't find a
way<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.360> really<00:07:22.539> make<00:07:22.719> it<00:07:22.750> flow<00:07:23.050> nicely

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
way to really make it flow nicely

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.020 
way to really make it flow nicely
because<00:07:23.590> I<00:07:23.740> had<00:07:23.830> about<00:07:23.979> 15<00:07:24.460> clips<00:07:24.789> to<00:07:24.940> go

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
because I had about 15 clips to go

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.390 
because I had about 15 clips to go
through<00:07:25.330> and<00:07:25.509> just<00:07:25.599> it<00:07:26.289> didn't<00:07:26.469> mesh<00:07:26.650> well<00:07:26.889> no

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
through and just it didn't mesh well no

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.749 
through and just it didn't mesh well no
