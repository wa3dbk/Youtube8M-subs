00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.796
We're going to have you travel the train line that goes from Shibuya to Kichijoji, the Keio Inokashira Line

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:13.964
and conquer it!

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:15.032
That's close!

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:19.503
You have to proceed to the next station by doing what is written on the card.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:22.639
There's a one in six chance.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.551
No one will pick up a sweaty guy like me!

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.952
Pick me up!

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.554
Pick me up!

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:38.155
Look!

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.389
They stopped for us!

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:40.824
No way!

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.526
This is great, thank you!!

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.495
All aboard!

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:48.365
Go one station on foot. Thank you!

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:49.466
Ok, I'm going!

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's go!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.301
Follow me!

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:52.803
He's walking!

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.212
We're overdoing the walking thing.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.148
You're fast!

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.550
You'll get tired!

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.019
Let's walk normally.

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:10.353
I'm tired.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:11.922
This is a long day.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.224
Look at that sign.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:15.559
What does that mean?

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:18.628
It's a path just for walking. Perfect, right?

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:20.363
It's so peaceful!

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:21.131
It's nice.

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.432
Just for walking.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:24.301
Could it be that this is, you know...

00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.103
A high class residential area!

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:27.737
No no no, not that.

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:30.440
These aren't high class.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.908
That's kinda rude.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.078
This is a nice area.

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:36.279
There's a cool breeze too.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.582
I saw places like this as a kid.

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:39.416
Ah yeah.

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:41.318
There's a massive Koi!

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:42.786
There's a massive Koi.

00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:45.722
Next,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.525
is Kuyagama station. The express stops there.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.827
I'm thinking of changing the cards.

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:52.596
It's here! Card changing time!

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:54.898
Yep! Something to look forward to.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.568
Something to look forward to? I'm not looking forward to anything!

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:01.638
Even if you add more fun cards I'm not going to choose them anyway.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.243
It's the "Train Game" but we haven't ridden a train yet.

00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:08.178
Yeah, it's like, what's this game again?

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:10.447
Yeah hey, it's the "Tokyo Train Game"

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.283
I've had enough.

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:16.286
Let's get a train on the next one.

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:19.756
Is this the station?!

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.003
Kugayama... this is Kugayama...

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:34.137
We made it!

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:38.208
This has been the easiest one so far but we have even easier ones!

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.709
Let's get a train card!

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.015
The cards we will change at the express station are the train cards!

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:48.018
This is what they are changing to. This first one is...

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:50.420
Ride the express train for one section!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.556
OKAY!!

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.592
This will take you to the next express station.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.294
That's 3 or 4 stations right?

00:02:57.294 --> 00:02:58.128
Yeah.

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:01.631
It's not 3 or 4. This is the longest one, it's 5 stations.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.365
Five?!

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:03.567
Whoa!!

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:05.936
This is my chance...

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:06.570
Yeah.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.438
However, this isn't all.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:08.738
Okay.

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:10.730
The other new card is this!!

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.844
Go back one section by express!

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.447
Let's throw it away.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.381
C'mon.

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:18.882
There's a river just there.
No.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:19.816
There's a river just there.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:20.183
We're not throwing it.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:20.450
C'mon.
We're not throwing it.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.151
Back to Kichijoji...
C'mon.
We're not throwing it.

00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:23.150
Even though you worked so hard.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:26.590
How many hours has it taken? We're not talking minutes here!

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.525
Yeah but you want the express card, right?

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:29.426
Yeah I do.

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:30.627
Good luck.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.728
You could go straight to Eifukucho.

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:32.562
Hey Megwin
You could go straight to Eifukucho.

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.731
We want to ride the train.

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:36.366
What was the title again?

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.235
"Tokyo Train Game"

00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:40.203
Have you ridden a train?

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:41.204
No.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:42.472
Let's do it then.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.039
Okay.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.008
Okay, so this is the line-up.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.612
I hope you get it.

00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:50.080
It's easy to see from this side.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080
Give me your strength!

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.718
We want him to get the yellow one.

00:03:54.718 --> 00:03:55.218
That's right.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:56.052
You have to get the yellow one!

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.088
Okay then!

00:03:58.088 --> 00:04:00.090
We're heading to the next station.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.491
All...

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.490
aboard!

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:07.430
Not again.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.232
He's pulling a face again.

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:11.401
Let's be positive. It will be okay.

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:12.736
Okay...

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:14.271
Ready and...

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:19.976
Not now!

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.079
Megwin! What was the name of this game again?

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.147
Tokyo Train Game

00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:25.749
Right, and what did you get?

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.517
Hitchhike...

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:29.219
Hello!

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.588
I'm Asuka Dirty Soryu!

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:32.622
It's Dirtey.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.157
Dirtey!

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.162
The next stop is Fujimigaoka!

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:42.232
Now I'll show you just how good I am!

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.934
Oh, there goes Dirtey!

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:47.671
They're pretending they didn't see him!

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.809
They're debating whether or not to give him a lift.

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.184
They were teasing!

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:03.219
They were really thinking about it, Megwin!

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.954
Nah, he just nodded.

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:06.890
You have to approach them at that moment!

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:10.460
They're so cold!

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.230
Or maybe we're too close to the intersection. They can't stop.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.598
They're not allowed.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:18.001
Let's go to the other side of the tracks.

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:23.640
I didn't think hitchhiking would come up so much.

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:26.076
Me neither!

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:29.012
I thought I was finally gonna get the train!

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.148
The flag was set!

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:34.050
The train flag was set!

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.087
The "you can ride now" flag.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.322
This is a good spot! Right here.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:48.098
Even if you add more fun cards, I'm not going to choose them anyway.

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:52.769
Yeah, it's the "Train Game" but we haven't ridden any yet.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.239
Army crawling, hitchhiking...

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:58.875
And walking. The title means nothing!
