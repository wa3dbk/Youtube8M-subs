00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
done with shapes so you go to solids

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.210

should make sure to cover this whole
phase<00:01:52.659> that's<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.780> easiest<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:56.229> later<00:01:57.940> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
phase that's the easiest one later and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:09.399 
phase that's the easiest one later and
circle<00:01:59.330> again<00:02:01.630> Spurs<00:02:02.630> I

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:41.830 

just<00:02:10.409> killed<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.129> bit

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.050 

on<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:42.530> hand<00:02:42.560> there

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.230 

now<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> mouth<00:02:53.709> took<00:02:54.400> me<00:02:54.520> forever<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:55.150> find

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
now do the mouth took me forever to find

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.610 
now do the mouth took me forever to find
this<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.560> go<00:02:56.650> down<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.100> wave<00:03:04.500> move<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
this but you go down to wave move it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.960 
this but you go down to wave move it
down<00:03:05.740> here<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.120> warp<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:09.819> go

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
down here and you get a warp and you go

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.290 
down here and you get a warp and you go
like<00:03:10.239> almost<00:03:10.750> clear<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> end<00:03:12.060> back<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.239> up

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
like almost clear to the end back it up

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.620 
like almost clear to the end back it up
a<00:03:13.420> little<00:03:13.510> bit<00:03:13.750> right<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:15.300> that's<00:03:16.300> half<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
a little bit right there that's half the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:27.140 
a little bit right there that's half the
mouth<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:18.430> we'll<00:03:18.670> take<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.620> up

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.480 

scale<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.110 

then<00:03:35.490> rotate<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.700> part<00:03:38.940> over

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
then rotate it so that the part over

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.470 
then rotate it so that the part over
lips<00:03:39.990> just<00:03:40.560> sticking<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.280> little<00:03:41.430> bit<00:03:44.480> I'll

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
lips just sticking up a little bit I'll

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.380 
lips just sticking up a little bit I'll
put<00:03:45.660> an<00:03:45.780> angle

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:04:07.160 

copy<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:51.420> flip<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.820> then<00:03:54.970> move<00:03:55.240> it

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:23.960 

or<00:04:08.170> kid<00:04:08.500> down<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.710> little<00:04:08.890> bit

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.000 

and<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.390> go

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.170 

took<00:04:28.520> me<00:04:28.610> forever<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:29.090> find<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.540> though<00:04:31.180> cuz

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
took me forever to find that though cuz

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.240 
took me forever to find that though cuz
I've<00:04:32.270> seen<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.480> bunch<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.840> people<00:04:33.140> making<00:04:33.250> faces

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
I've seen a bunch of people making faces

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.120 
I've seen a bunch of people making faces
and<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:35.180> just<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.080> isn't<00:04:36.410> any<00:04:36.620> good<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.070> I

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
and I just like that isn't any good so I

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.190 
and I just like that isn't any good so I
decided<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.610> go<00:04:37.760> make<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.270> own<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:38.960> found

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
out how to do that with wave so there's

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.320 
out how to do that with wave so there's
a<00:04:46.280> joker<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.520> for<00:04:49.520> anyone<00:04:49.730> who<00:04:49.910> wants<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.180> make
