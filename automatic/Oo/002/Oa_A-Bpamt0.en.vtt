00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.240 
over the swim sconce giant ass afro and
he<00:04:21.660> does<00:04:21.810> go<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.200> toxic<00:04:22.590> here<00:04:22.800> I'm

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
he does go for the toxic here I'm

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.640 
he does go for the toxic here I'm
assuming<00:04:23.730> his<00:04:23.850> other<00:04:24.090> moves<00:04:24.330> like

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
assuming his other moves like

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.110 
assuming his other moves like
a good<00:04:24.860> Draenor<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.400> turn<00:04:25.610> something<00:04:25.910> which

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
a good Draenor you turn something which

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.090 
a good Draenor you turn something which
wouldn't<00:04:26.389> do<00:04:26.509> much<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:27.050> saw<00:04:27.229> him<00:04:27.320> swimming<00:04:27.530> yet

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
wouldn't do much I saw him swimming yet

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.070 
wouldn't do much I saw him swimming yet
so<00:04:28.310> toxic<00:04:28.729> would<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> best<00:04:29.300> move<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.930> would

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
so toxic would be the best move it would

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.840 
so toxic would be the best move it would
widdle<00:04:30.410> me<00:04:30.530> down<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.949> it<00:04:31.190> would<00:04:31.340> reduce<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
widdle me down and it would reduce the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.999 
widdle me down and it would reduce the
