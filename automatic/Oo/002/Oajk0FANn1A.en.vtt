00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.810
 to teach as drawers to manual since 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.200
 some subscribers of my channel I 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.200
 they were asking 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.740
 for 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.110
 to upload heights to manual 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.620
 the most important is to have a bath very 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.780
 checked 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.510
 what you want to try to upload what 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.790
 you have to have an illuminated to upload it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.380
 yellow or are you going something 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.270
 they make a bar and like 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.430
 leftovers 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.410
 once you have already found that 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.780
 be a curb for example a case like 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.170
 this 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 then you should start doing a bath 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.650
 trying 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.700
 stay with the front wheels very 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.250
 so high the bunny and barely without raising 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.140
 knees up or up the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 knees just enough so that you among the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 back then they were inside the drawer 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 once you're as above you should 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.640
 push the legs towards 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.420
 down so that the rear wheel 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.790
 touch the drawer well before 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 to the strength and bike 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.010
 will keep a little raised just that is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.080
 we go a little up 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.720
 or doing today equilibrium that the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.000
 You can already do a little bit of manual 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.070
 distance or you can start to replicate 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.810
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.450
 really for this as it does not 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.159
 lack of very controlled hardware 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.970
 I did it when I did not know how to do 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.630
 good maradona 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.670
 and good the main 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.930
 and advice that you have very mastered the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.640
 neighborhood needs to have better varnish 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.070
 that the manual 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200
 I recommend the months go to a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.330
 normal speed just so that the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.430
 rear wheel or always 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.070
 and then little by little you can go more 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 Quick 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.780
 because it 's say do not go fast to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.360
 beginning 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.240
 because maybe because of fear you can 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 go back or come out on one side and 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.980
 maybe you can fall for that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.180
 I recommend going at the speed right here 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.819
 to upload 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.000
 and really if it's not done it's a lot 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.090
 manual I advise you to put the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.370
 very strong legs down doing 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.370
 force down now we will leave you 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.620
 where you will see that I do not do it from manual 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.170
 but yes he nailed the rear wheel and 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 only you had created it already arm 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 I had kept 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.400
 and it's a very simple trick 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.080
 If you want to make a tutorial 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.930
 so simple tricks 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.140
 and I will try to do them good I hope that 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.880
 you liked this tutorial and
