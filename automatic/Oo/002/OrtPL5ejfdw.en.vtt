00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
they've been chewin on it for a

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.749 
they've been chewin on it for a
filtration<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:29.199> got<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.619> sponge<00:00:29.979> filters<00:00:30.460> here

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
filtration we got to sponge filters here

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.860 
filtration we got to sponge filters here
for<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:33.060> internal<00:00:34.060> it's<00:00:34.180> got<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.390> power<00:00:34.660> head

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
for the internal it's got a power head

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.420 
for the internal it's got a power head
on<00:00:34.990> the<00:00:35.110> top<00:00:35.260> there<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:35.860> sucks<00:00:36.100> it<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.400> a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
on the top there and it sucks it to a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.870 
on the top there and it sucks it to a
sponge<00:00:36.880> so<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:38.500> basic<00:00:39.100> there's<00:00:39.340> no<00:00:39.460> carbon

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
sponge so very basic there's no carbon

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.640 
sponge so very basic there's no carbon
in<00:00:39.970> this<00:00:40.120> filter<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.780> do<00:00:40.990> the<00:00:41.110> water<00:00:41.320> chain

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
in this filter so to do the water chain

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.400 
in this filter so to do the water chain
just<00:00:41.830> keeps<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.280> water<00:00:42.430> nice<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.910> clear<00:00:43.410> but

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
just keeps the water nice and clear but

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.990 
just keeps the water nice and clear but
a<00:00:44.440> lot<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.650> these<00:00:44.830> fish<00:00:45.100> have<00:00:45.130> been<00:00:45.460> born<00:00:45.730> here

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
a lot of these fish have been born here

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
a lot of these fish have been born here
they're<00:00:46.180> both<00:00:46.360> second<00:00:47.350> or<00:00:47.440> third<00:00:47.620> generation

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.580 

so<00:00:51.160> yeah<00:00:51.400> just<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.329> sorted<00:00:52.750> African<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.380> very

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
so yeah just a sorted African it's very

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.110 
so yeah just a sorted African it's very
simple<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.590> this<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.520> tank<00:00:57.820> from<00:00:58.000> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
simple and this is that tank from the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.300 
simple and this is that tank from the
other<00:00:58.239> side<00:00:58.480> of<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.630> wall<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.040> can<00:01:00.160> see

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
other side of the wall so you can see

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.919 
other side of the wall so you can see
how<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.610> incorporate<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.420> wall<00:01:02.260> coverings<00:01:02.770> to

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
how to incorporate the wall coverings to

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:13.649 
how to incorporate the wall coverings to
accentuate<00:01:04.929> the<00:01:05.350> fish<00:01:05.560> tank<00:01:07.319> and<00:01:08.399> there<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.490> is

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659

and then the next time you clean it away

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
and then the next time you clean it away
and<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.640> easy<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> tell<00:01:51.270> which<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.049> as

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.120 

you<00:02:44.270> just<00:02:44.660> keep<00:02:44.840> using<00:02:45.080> these<00:02:45.350> sponges<00:02:45.680> over

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
you just keep using these sponges over

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.720 
you just keep using these sponges over
and<00:02:46.250> over<00:02:46.340> again<00:02:46.550> filling<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:48.280> basically<00:02:49.280> you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and over again filling it basically you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.070 
and over again filling it basically you
know<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.940> can't<00:02:50.270> use<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.570> find<00:02:50.840> anymore

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
know you can't use this find anymore

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.290 
know you can't use this find anymore
when<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.500> squeeze<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.700> stays<00:02:52.940> squeeze

when you squeeze it and it stays squeeze

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.850 
when you squeeze it and it stays squeeze
it<00:02:53.540> doesn't<00:02:53.840> come<00:02:53.960> on<00:02:54.080> squeeze<00:02:57.100> on<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.340> I'll

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
it doesn't come on squeeze on this I'll

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.400 
it doesn't come on squeeze on this I'll
take<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.010> chamber<00:03:01.720> take<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> other<00:03:03.110> stuff

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
take the chamber take the other stuff

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.060 
take the chamber take the other stuff
and<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.900> such<00:03:06.140> perfection<00:03:06.500> you're<00:03:06.890> just

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
and all such perfection you're just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.880 
and all such perfection you're just
trying<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.370> get<00:03:07.460> most<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.970> dirt<00:03:08.150> out<00:03:08.890> in

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
trying to get most of the dirt out in

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.710 
trying to get most of the dirt out in
this<00:03:10.130> system<00:03:10.370> because<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.420> two<00:03:11.600> of

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
this system because we have the two of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.400 
this system because we have the two of
them<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.960> have<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.110> better<00:03:12.380> advantage<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:15.170> you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
them and have a better advantage if you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.560 
them and have a better advantage if you
have<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.830> one<00:03:16.070> it's<00:03:16.370> probably<00:03:16.820> best<00:03:17.180> if<00:03:17.420> to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
have just one it's probably best if to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.660 
have just one it's probably best if to
clean<00:03:17.780> one<00:03:17.990> spine<00:03:18.380> bluntly<00:03:18.740> one<00:03:19.160> sponge<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
clean one spine bluntly one sponge the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.220 
clean one spine bluntly one sponge the
next<00:03:19.940> streak<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:20.600> all<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> meat<00:03:21.020> back

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
next streak and just all the meat back

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.200 
next streak and just all the meat back
and<00:03:21.500> forth<00:03:21.710> and<00:03:22.460> that<00:03:22.580> way<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.820> don't<00:03:23.000> have

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
and forth and that way you don't have

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.040 
and forth and that way you don't have
the<00:03:24.580> bacteria<00:03:25.580> where<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.570> lose<00:03:26.750> your

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
the bacteria where you lose your

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.260 
the bacteria where you lose your
bacteria<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.460> an<00:03:28.520> ammonia<00:03:28.760> spike<00:03:29.120> in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
bacteria and you get an ammonia spike in

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.510 
bacteria and you get an ammonia spike in
your<00:03:29.360> fish<00:03:29.540> tank<00:03:29.570> before<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.800> bacteria<00:03:31.280> comes

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
your fish tank before the bacteria comes

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.130 
your fish tank before the bacteria comes
back<00:03:32.770> okay<00:03:34.240> you'll<00:03:35.240> notice<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.960> have<00:03:35.990> a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
back okay you'll notice that I have a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.640 
back okay you'll notice that I have a
tendency<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.800> filter<00:03:37.340> tanks<00:03:37.700> quite<00:03:37.940> heavily

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
tendency to filter tanks quite heavily

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.760 
tendency to filter tanks quite heavily
that<00:03:39.650> way<00:03:41.020> somebody<00:03:42.020> over<00:03:42.290> feeds<00:03:42.560> or

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
that way somebody over feeds or

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.700 
that way somebody over feeds or
something<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.400> don't<00:03:43.580> get<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.730> problem<00:03:47.710> we're

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
something you don't get a problem we're

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.880 
something you don't get a problem we're
going<00:03:48.890> on<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:50.420> put<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.630> sponges<00:03:51.260> back<00:03:51.530> into

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
going on you put the sponges back into

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.570 
going on you put the sponges back into
the<00:03:52.040> Chamber's<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.590> fit<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.070> there<00:03:55.280> nice<00:03:55.550> and

it<00:04:45.790> back<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.210> tank<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:47.140> goes<00:04:47.320> on<00:04:47.530> to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
it back in the tank and it goes on to

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:58.950 
it back in the tank and it goes on to
the<00:04:48.010> bottom<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> motor<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.210> Oh<00:04:57.960> in

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the bottom of the motor just like Oh in

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.100 
the bottom of the motor just like Oh in
fact<00:04:59.170> still<00:05:00.100> gonna<00:05:00.310> shoot<00:05:00.610> slaughter<00:05:00.850> now

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
fact still gonna shoot slaughter now

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.480 
fact still gonna shoot slaughter now
okay<00:05:04.260> okay<00:05:05.260> there<00:05:05.620> now<00:05:05.830> we're<00:05:06.040> filling<00:05:06.370> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
okay okay there now we're filling the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.660 
okay okay there now we're filling the
tank<00:05:06.760> back<00:05:07.090> up<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:07.920> you<00:05:08.920> can<00:05:09.040> see<00:05:09.070> how<00:05:09.250> easy

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
tank back up so you can see how easy

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.830 
tank back up so you can see how easy
that<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.630> mixer<00:05:11.050> tap<00:05:11.290> up<00:05:11.590> there<00:05:11.950> and<00:05:12.840> I

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
that is is the mixer tap up there and I

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.250 
that is is the mixer tap up there and I
got<00:05:14.650> deeper<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.460> water<00:05:15.610> already<00:05:16.050> so<00:05:17.050> that

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
got deeper in the water already so that

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.470 
got deeper in the water already so that
way<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.680> water<00:05:18.040> as<00:05:18.310> soon<00:05:18.460> as<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.730> goes<00:05:18.880> in<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
way the water as soon as it goes in the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.660 
way the water as soon as it goes in the
chlorines<00:05:19.900> removed<00:05:20.440> doesn't<00:05:21.190> hurt<00:05:21.490> the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
chlorines removed doesn't hurt the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.360 
chlorines removed doesn't hurt the
bacteria<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.600> filters<00:05:22.990> are<00:05:23.200> working<00:05:23.710> so

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
bacteria the filters are working so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.250 
bacteria the filters are working so
we'll<00:05:24.490> just<00:05:24.550> fill<00:05:24.910> this<00:05:25.060> tank<00:05:25.330> back<00:05:25.690> up<00:05:25.960> and
