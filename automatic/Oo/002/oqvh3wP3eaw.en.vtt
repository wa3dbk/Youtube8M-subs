drop my yarn however what I'm going to
do<00:01:48.500> instead<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.979> I'm<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.159> going<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.460> go<00:01:49.579> all

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
do instead is I'm just going to go all

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.690 
do instead is I'm just going to go all
the<00:01:49.909> way<00:01:50.180> into<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.650> stitch<00:01:51.979> on<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.280> row<00:01:52.460> below

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the way into the stitch on the row below

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.580 
the way into the stitch on the row below
and<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.600> way<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.900> can<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
and the way that you can see that is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.620 
and the way that you can see that is
it's<00:01:54.799> not<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.070> loop<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:55.909> my<00:01:56.030> running<00:01:56.360> yarn

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
it's not the loop that my running yarn

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.719 
it's not the loop that my running yarn
is<00:01:56.840> pulled<00:01:57.140> out<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:58.100> actually<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.520> loop

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
is pulled out of it's actually the loop

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.429 
is pulled out of it's actually the loop
just<00:01:58.970> below<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.299> so<00:01:59.750> I'm<00:01:59.810> going<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.960> go<00:02:00.110> below

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
just below that so I'm going to go below

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.740 
just below that so I'm going to go below
I'm<00:02:01.009> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.610> grab<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.850> loop<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.270> yarn<00:02:02.420> and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
I'm going to grab a loop of yarn and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.960 
I'm going to grab a loop of yarn and
pull<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.049> through<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:03.439> I've<00:02:04.189> got<00:02:04.340> two<00:02:04.549> stitches

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
pull it through so I've got two stitches

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.600 
pull it through so I've got two stitches
that<00:02:05.000> grew<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.540> this<00:02:05.810> one<00:02:06.020> stitch<00:02:06.290> here

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that grew out of this one stitch here

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.340 
that grew out of this one stitch here
now<00:02:07.610> I'm<00:02:08.000> going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.299> make<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.450> stitch<00:02:08.810> with<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
now I'm going to make a stitch with the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.050 
now I'm going to make a stitch with the
increased<00:02:09.769> stitch<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.369> right<00:02:10.579> side<00:02:10.880> of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
increased stitch on the right side of

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.310 
increased stitch on the right side of
the<00:02:11.180> stitch<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:11.630> it's<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.840> left-leaning

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the stitch so it's a left-leaning

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.940 
the stitch so it's a left-leaning
increase<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.840> order<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.500> I'll<00:02:15.769> just

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
increase in order to do that I'll just

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.949 
increase in order to do that I'll just
reverse<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.430> order<00:02:16.579> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.790> steps<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.269> going

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
reverse the order of the steps I'm going

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.069 
reverse the order of the steps I'm going
to<00:02:18.079> knit<00:02:18.260> into<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.769> row<00:02:18.950> below<00:02:19.130> first<00:02:20.079> pull

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
to knit into the row below first pull

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.590 
to knit into the row below first pull
through<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.590> then<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.790> knit<00:02:23.180> into<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
through and then just knit into the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.130 
through and then just knit into the
stitch<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:24.079> top<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:26.000> I've<00:02:26.209> got<00:02:26.420> four

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
stitch on top and so I've got four

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.949 
stitch on top and so I've got four
stitches<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:27.769> where<00:02:27.980> there<00:02:28.100> were<00:02:28.220> two<00:02:28.250> and

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
stitches now where there were two and

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
stitches now where there were two and
the<00:02:29.959> into<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.380> really<00:02:30.650> intriguing<00:02:31.070> thing

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the into the really intriguing thing

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.789 
the into the really intriguing thing
about<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.850> increase<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.440> can<00:02:33.620> work

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
about this increase is that you can work

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.979 
about this increase is that you can work
it<00:02:33.980> right<00:02:34.190> next<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.820> another<00:02:35.030> increase<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
it right next to another increase of the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.690 
it right next to another increase of the
same<00:02:36.200> type<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.190> need<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.519> have<00:02:37.670> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
same type you don't need to have a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370 
same type you don't need to have a
stitch<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.209> between<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.690> kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> take<00:02:39.109> up<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
stitch in between to kind of take up the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.550 
stitch in between to kind of take up the
slack<00:02:39.530> or<00:02:39.949> to<00:02:40.639> anchor<00:02:41.269> them<00:02:41.449> as<00:02:41.630> with<00:02:41.930> any<00:02:42.350> kind

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
slack or to anchor them as with any kind

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.750 
slack or to anchor them as with any kind
of<00:02:42.620> yarn<00:02:42.919> over<00:02:43.220> increase

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
of yarn over increase

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.929 
of yarn over increase
or<00:02:43.970> any<00:02:44.390> increase<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:44.989> uses<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
or any increase that uses the that the

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.390 
or any increase that uses the that the
bar<00:02:47.209> between<00:02:47.450> two<00:02:47.689> stitches<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.799> again<00:02:49.159> I'll

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
bar between two stitches so again I'll

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.850 
bar between two stitches so again I'll
show<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.480> right<00:02:50.810> leaning<00:02:51.230> increase<00:02:51.650> is

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
show you that right leaning increase is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.300 
show you that right leaning increase is
to<00:02:52.430> knit<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.390> stitch<00:02:53.659> and<00:02:53.959> then<00:02:54.709> knit<00:02:55.010> into

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
to knit the stitch and then knit into

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.990 
to knit the stitch and then knit into
the<00:02:55.640> loop<00:02:55.819> below<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:57.319> drop<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.709> off<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
the loop below and drop it off the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.619 
the loop below and drop it off the
left-leaning<00:02:59.420> increase<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:01.390> knit<00:03:02.390> into

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
left-leaning increase is to knit into

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.369 
left-leaning increase is to knit into
the<00:03:02.900> bottom<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.409> row<00:03:03.890> below<00:03:04.040> first<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.379> then

the bottom the row below first and then

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.670 
the bottom the row below first and then
knit<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> stitch<00:03:06.860> on<00:03:06.980> top<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.650> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
knit the stitch on top and this is a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.770 
knit the stitch on top and this is a
very<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.549> I<00:03:10.609> think<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.299> as<00:03:11.569> a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
very you know I I think of this as a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.410 
very you know I I think of this as a
sort<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.799> an<00:03:12.920> upscale<00:03:13.400> increase<00:03:14.060> or<00:03:14.299> an

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
sort of an upscale increase or an

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.880 
sort of an upscale increase or an
advanced<00:03:14.930> increase<00:03:16.959> it's<00:03:17.959> very<00:03:18.200> subtle<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
advanced increase it's very subtle and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.629 
advanced increase it's very subtle and
very<00:03:18.920> clean<00:03:20.739> another<00:03:21.739> increase<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.400> falls

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
very clean another increase that falls

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.849 
very clean another increase that falls
into<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.970> category<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.540> me<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:24.019> what's

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
into this category for me is what's

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.740 
into this category for me is what's
often<00:03:25.040> called<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.430> lifted<00:03:25.940> increase<00:03:26.389> or<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
often called a lifted increase or the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.680 
often called a lifted increase or the
knit<00:03:27.139> one<00:03:27.349> below<00:03:27.530> increase<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.519> it<00:03:29.389> sort<00:03:29.629> of

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
knit one below increase and it sort of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.449 
knit one below increase and it sort of
is<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.049> same<00:03:30.319> spirit<00:03:30.920> as<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.099> last

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
is in the same spirit as the last

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.280 
is in the same spirit as the last
increase<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.090> it's<00:03:32.209> just<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.629> little<00:03:32.959> bit<00:03:33.079> more

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
increase but it's just a little bit more

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.740 
increase but it's just a little bit more

let me lay this flat for you first so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.180 
let me lay this flat for you first so
that<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:43.909> can<00:03:44.030> see<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:44.510> how<00:03:45.319> subtle<00:03:45.980> these

increases really are the fabric is

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.629 
increases really are the fabric is

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.759 
growing all along the center here
obviously<00:03:49.819> but<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:50.900> really<00:03:51.079> hardly<00:03:51.470> see

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
obviously but you can really hardly see

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.729 
obviously but you can really hardly see
where<00:03:51.980> they<00:03:52.129> begin<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.549> where<00:03:52.639> they<00:03:52.760> end<00:03:53.739> so

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
where they begin and where they end so

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.259

increase<00:03:56.810> first<00:03:57.940> what<00:03:58.940> what<00:03:59.030> I'm<00:03:59.120> going<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.269> do

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
increase first what what I'm going to do

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.650 
increase first what what I'm going to do
is<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.989> going<00:04:00.199> to<00:04:00.319> actually<00:04:01.329> pick<00:04:02.329> up<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
is I'm going to actually pick up the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.580 
is I'm going to actually pick up the
stitch<00:04:03.400> pick<00:04:04.400> up<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.819> left<00:04:05.180> leg<00:04:05.359> of<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.410> loop

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
stitch pick up the left leg of the loop

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.460 
stitch pick up the left leg of the loop
two<00:04:07.519> rows<00:04:08.359> below<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.109> stitch<00:04:09.349> that's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
two rows below the stitch that's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.050 
two rows below the stitch that's
actually<00:04:09.799> on<00:04:09.889> my<00:04:10.010> needle<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.699> here's<00:04:10.879> how<00:04:11.000> to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
actually on my needle so here's how to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.759 
actually on my needle so here's how to
count<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.260> stitch<00:04:12.470> that's<00:04:12.620> on

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
count that this is the stitch that's on

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.789 
count that this is the stitch that's on
my<00:04:12.889> needle<00:04:13.220> this<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:15.019> stitch<00:04:15.290> of<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.620> row

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
my needle this is the stitch of the row

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.819 
my needle this is the stitch of the row
below<00:04:15.980> these<00:04:16.729> two<00:04:16.760> legs<00:04:17.209> here<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.690> then<00:04:18.590> this

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
below these two legs here and then this

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.740 
below these two legs here and then this
is<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.190> stitch<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.760> row<00:04:19.940> below<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.479> and

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
is the stitch of the row below that and

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.330 
is the stitch of the row below that and
we'll<00:04:21.320> talk<00:04:21.440> about<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:21.859> second<00:04:22.220> but

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
we'll talk about that in a second but

we'll talk about that in a second but
I'm<00:04:22.460> going<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.669> pick<00:04:22.789> up<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> left<00:04:23.270> loop<00:04:23.479> of

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
I'm going to pick up the left loop of

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.020 
I'm going to pick up the left loop of

is a new stitch those just seemingly

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.290 
is a new stitch those just seemingly
grow<00:05:09.200> out<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.440> nowhere<00:05:09.710> why<00:05:10.430> do<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.700> pick<00:05:10.940> up<00:05:10.970> on

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
grow out of nowhere why do we pick up on

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.380 
grow out of nowhere why do we pick up on
once<00:05:11.630> on<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:12.290> row<00:05:12.740> below<00:05:12.920> for<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.670> for<00:05:14.240> one

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
once on one row below for the for one

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.630 
once on one row below for the for one
increase<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:15.440> two<00:05:15.800> rows<00:05:16.040> below<00:05:16.340> for<00:05:16.580> the

increase and for two rows below for the

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.490 
increase and for two rows below for the
other<00:05:16.790> one<00:05:16.970> well<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.480> reason<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.870> because<00:05:17.900> you

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
other one well the reason is because you

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.740 
other one well the reason is because you
know<00:05:18.830> when<00:05:18.920> we're<00:05:19.130> making<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.850> that<00:05:20.330> second

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
know when we're making that that second

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.300 
know when we're making that that second
increase<00:05:21.080> we're<00:05:21.590> picking<00:05:21.890> up<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.100> right<00:05:22.250> leg

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
increase we're picking up the right leg

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.590 
increase we're picking up the right leg
of<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.000> row<00:05:23.150> below<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:24.730> then<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:26.030> then<00:05:26.390> we're

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
of the row below and then and then we're

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.590 
of the row below and then and then we're
knitting<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.470> stitch<00:05:27.880> when<00:05:28.880> we<00:05:29.030> make<00:05:29.240> the

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
knitting the stitch when we make the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.120 
knitting the stitch when we make the
increase<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.140> picks<00:05:30.380> up<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.680> left<00:05:30.890> leg

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
increase that picks up the left leg

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.060 
increase that picks up the left leg
obviously<00:05:31.810> we've<00:05:32.810> already<00:05:33.110> knitted<00:05:33.920> the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
obviously we've already knitted the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.190 
obviously we've already knitted the
stitch<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:34.670> that<00:05:35.450> loop<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.840> going<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:36.080> be

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
stitch that that loop is going to be

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.660 
stitch that that loop is going to be
picked<00:05:36.440> up<00:05:36.560> off<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:37.010> you<00:05:37.280> know<00:05:37.370> sort<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.580> that

picked up off of you know sort of that

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.460 
picked up off of you know sort of that
column<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.300> stitches<00:05:38.510> so<00:05:39.170> we've<00:05:39.290> already

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
column of stitches so we've already

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.770 
column of stitches so we've already
knitted<00:05:39.920> this<00:05:40.100> stitch<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:41.240> we<00:05:41.360> picked<00:05:41.600> up

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
knitted this stitch and if we picked up

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.350 
knitted this stitch and if we picked up
this<00:05:42.350> loop<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.130> we<00:05:43.760> pull<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.150> loop<00:05:44.330> through

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
this loop and we pull the loop through

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.350 
this loop and we pull the loop through
all<00:05:44.960> we'd<00:05:45.710> end<00:05:45.890> up<00:05:46.010> with<00:05:46.250> is<00:05:46.430> just<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.760> yarn<00:05:47.030> over

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
all we'd end up with is just a yarn over

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.570 
all we'd end up with is just a yarn over
sort<00:05:48.230> of<00:05:48.320> wrapped<00:05:48.560> around<00:05:48.710> twice<00:05:49.010> because

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
sort of wrapped around twice because

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.060 
sort of wrapped around twice because
there's<00:05:50.120> there's<00:05:50.540> no<00:05:50.750> kind<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.380> anchor<00:05:51.710> for<00:05:51.980> it

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
there's there's no kind of anchor for it

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.860 
there's there's no kind of anchor for it
it<00:05:52.370> would<00:05:52.460> be<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.730> equivalent<00:05:52.820> of<00:05:53.480> if<00:05:53.720> we

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
it would be the equivalent of if we

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.040 
it would be the equivalent of if we
tried<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.320> pick<00:05:54.500> up<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.910> loop<00:05:56.120> of<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.390> leg<00:05:56.870> of

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
tried to pick up the loop of the leg of

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.990 
tried to pick up the loop of the leg of
the<00:05:57.170> loop<00:05:57.350> that's<00:05:57.530> on<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.890> needle<00:05:58.010> now<00:05:58.370> so

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
the loop that's on the needle now so

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.840 
the loop that's on the needle now so
we've<00:05:59.690> already<00:05:59.960> knitted<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.650> stitch<00:06:00.920> so

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
we've already knitted the stitch so

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.580 
we've already knitted the stitch so
we're<00:06:02.000> going<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.150> go<00:06:02.470> two<00:06:03.470> rows<00:06:03.800> below<00:06:04.100> and

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
we're going to go two rows below and

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.540 
we're going to go two rows below and
knit<00:06:06.590> into<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:07.100> to<00:06:07.940> make<00:06:08.090> our<00:06:08.210> increases<00:06:08.780> and

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
knit into that to make our increases and

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.040 
knit into that to make our increases and
these<00:06:10.550> are<00:06:10.700> both<00:06:10.880> really<00:06:11.180> subtle<00:06:11.720> sort<00:06:11.960> of

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
these are both really subtle sort of

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.450 
these are both really subtle sort of
beautiful<00:06:12.320> increases<00:06:12.950> that<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.160> can<00:06:13.310> use

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
beautiful increases that you can use

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.570 
beautiful increases that you can use
along<00:06:13.730> Raglan<00:06:14.180> shoulder<00:06:14.510> lines<00:06:15.340> just<00:06:16.340> for<00:06:16.550> a

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
along Raglan shoulder lines just for a

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.080 
along Raglan shoulder lines just for a
basic<00:06:17.120> primer<00:06:17.390> real<00:06:17.720> quick<00:06:17.990> on<00:06:18.790> some<00:06:19.790> of<00:06:19.970> your

basic primer real quick on some of your

basic primer real quick on some of your
more<00:06:20.270> standard<00:06:20.750> increases<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.590> make<00:06:21.830> one

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
more standard increases the make one

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.400 
more standard increases the make one
increases<00:06:22.550> are<00:06:23.000> still<00:06:23.600> good<00:06:23.840> options<00:06:24.290> for

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
increases are still good options for

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.590 
increases are still good options for
Raglan<00:06:24.860> increases<00:06:25.250> they<00:06:25.850> are<00:06:26.000> very<00:06:26.300> subtle

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
Raglan increases they are very subtle

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.910 
Raglan increases they are very subtle
their<00:06:26.930> only<00:06:27.080> problem<00:06:27.290> is<00:06:27.530> that<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:27.680> can't

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
their only problem is that you can't

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.960 
their only problem is that you can't
work<00:06:28.100> them<00:06:28.310> right<00:06:28.490> next<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.760> each<00:06:28.880> other

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
work them right next to each other

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.040 
work them right next to each other
because<00:06:29.150> they<00:06:29.300> tend<00:06:29.480> to<00:06:29.510> take<00:06:29.720> up<00:06:29.870> too<00:06:30.020> much

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
because they tend to take up too much

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.560 
because they tend to take up too much
slack<00:06:30.470> so<00:06:31.220> for<00:06:31.430> make<00:06:31.550> one<00:06:31.730> increases<00:06:32.150> we're

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
slack so for make one increases we're

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.440 
slack so for make one increases we're
always<00:06:32.750> looking<00:06:33.200> at<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.830> bar<00:06:34.190> of<00:06:34.520> yarn<00:06:35.240> that's

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
always looking at the bar of yarn that's

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.880 
always looking at the bar of yarn that's
running<00:06:35.750> between<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.320> stitch<00:06:36.530> on<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.770> right

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
running between the stitch on the right

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.730 
running between the stitch on the right
needle<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.820> loop<00:06:38.000> on<00:06:38.150> the<00:06:38.240> left<00:06:38.390> needle

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
needle and the loop on the left needle

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.020 
needle and the loop on the left needle
I'm<00:06:39.740> going<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.950> pick<00:06:40.130> it<00:06:40.250> up<00:06:40.400> just<00:06:40.940> by

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
I'm going to pick it up just by

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.430 
I'm going to pick it up just by
inserting<00:06:41.390> my<00:06:41.480> right<00:06:41.690> needle<00:06:41.900> into<00:06:42.020> it<00:06:42.290> and

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
inserting my right needle into it and

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.470 
inserting my right needle into it and
I'm<00:06:42.860> going<00:06:42.980> to<00:06:43.010> put<00:06:43.250> it<00:06:43.370> on<00:06:43.520> to<00:06:43.910> my<00:06:44.030> left<00:06:44.240> needle

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
I'm going to put it on to my left needle

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.740 
I'm going to put it on to my left needle
sort<00:06:45.260> of<00:06:45.320> oriented<00:06:46.040> knitwise<00:06:46.490> so<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.510> front

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
sort of oriented knitwise so the front

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.350 
sort of oriented knitwise so the front
loop<00:06:47.990> is<00:06:48.170> on<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:49.250> right<00:06:49.460> leg<00:06:49.730> is<00:06:49.910> on<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.120> front

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
loop is on the right leg is on the front

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.490 
loop is on the right leg is on the front
and<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.860> left<00:06:52.790> leg<00:06:53.000> is<00:06:53.150> in<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.330> back<00:06:53.510> now

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
and the the left leg is in the back now

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.140 
and the the left leg is in the back now
I'm<00:06:54.620> going<00:06:54.800> to<00:06:54.890> knit<00:06:55.040> into<00:06:55.250> the<00:06:55.610> back<00:06:55.880> of<00:06:55.910> the

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
I'm going to knit into the back of the

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.690 
I'm going to knit into the back of the
stitch<00:06:56.390> which<00:06:57.170> twists<00:06:57.590> it<00:06:57.710> as<00:06:57.830> I<00:06:58.310> knit<00:06:58.520> and

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
stitch which twists it as I knit and

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.520 
stitch which twists it as I knit and
when<00:06:59.270> you<00:06:59.360> knit<00:06:59.540> on<00:06:59.690> you<00:06:59.900> can<00:07:00.050> see<00:07:00.230> that<00:07:00.380> that

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
when you knit on you can see that that

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.950 
when you knit on you can see that that
is<00:07:00.800> just<00:07:01.460> a<00:07:01.790> nice<00:07:01.970> subtle<00:07:02.300> little<00:07:02.570> increase

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
is just a nice subtle little increase

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.370 
is just a nice subtle little increase
the<00:07:03.620> opposite<00:07:04.190> of<00:07:04.310> that<00:07:04.490> is<00:07:04.670> to<00:07:05.270> pick<00:07:05.450> up<00:07:05.690> that

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
the opposite of that is to pick up that

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.730 
the opposite of that is to pick up that
loop<00:07:06.800> and<00:07:07.330> then<00:07:08.330> orient<00:07:08.750> it<00:07:08.930> backwards<00:07:09.410> onto

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
loop and then orient it backwards onto

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.050 
loop and then orient it backwards onto
your<00:07:10.370> needle

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
your needle

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.150 
your needle
so<00:07:11.150> that<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.480> left<00:07:11.690> leg<00:07:12.050> is<00:07:12.290> in<00:07:12.350> front<00:07:12.800> and

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
so that the left leg is in front and

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.190 
so that the left leg is in front and
then<00:07:13.700> knit<00:07:13.940> into<00:07:14.090> the<00:07:14.210> front<00:07:14.300> of<00:07:14.660> it<00:07:14.750> as<00:07:14.840> normal

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
then knit into the front of it as normal

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.680 
then knit into the front of it as normal
so<00:07:15.580> there<00:07:16.580> are<00:07:16.700> some<00:07:16.880> really<00:07:17.180> fun<00:07:17.450> new

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
so there are some really fun new

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.510 
so there are some really fun new
increases<00:07:18.260> to<00:07:18.530> take<00:07:18.710> you<00:07:18.889> on<00:07:19.010> your<00:07:19.160> top<00:07:19.340> down

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520
