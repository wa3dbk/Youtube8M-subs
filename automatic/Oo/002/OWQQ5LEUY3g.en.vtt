00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.460
 fantastic recipe for pork chop 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.489
 with mango sauce the mango is a fruit 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.710
 quite good enough for our 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.040
 organism which stays perfectly 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.900
 here in the climate of axarquía we passed 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.410
 to the ingredients we have the chop 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.720
 pork the mango for our sauce the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.710
 bottle the ingredients of the sauce that 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.960
 olive oil is pepper salt and 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.660
 spicy paprika we have in a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.759
 chive the garlic previously laminated a 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.030
 little bit of vinegar a little bit of sugar 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.890
 and the thyme that we have it to decorate 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.170
 we also have some water here and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.710
 and the base of our recipe that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.120
 they are some bakery potatoes previously 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.480
 fries 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.250
 for our recipe below john 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.890
 josé reche will proceed with marking the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.640
 pork chop we take a little 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 olive oil 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.659
 our pan is quite hot 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 that is well sealed 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 so as not to lose the juices in the chop 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.780
 while we mark our chop for 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.569
 both sides proceed with the sauce for 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.950
 we are peeling the handle depending 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.549
 of the amount of sauce in this case 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.299
 we will use the whole whole mango in 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.299
 this case half 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.880
 chop the mango in cubes 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.230
 It should be noted that the handle has a 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.239
 pretty wide bone in the middle 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.580
 We cut into cubes, no need 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.299
 nor so small in this case because 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.299
 when crushed 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.180
 but if it does not provide enough at the time 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.400
 of to put the arm 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.750
 the arm turn and in this case if we have 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.159
 we have we have very at home 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.159
 we can do it that way too 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.620
 while we continue with our sauce in 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.250
 this case we miss a little bit of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.960
 olive oil to sauté garlic on 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.010
 laminated garlic that we have already laminated 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.010
 beforehand 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.770
 we toss our mango cut into cubes 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.550
 Y 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.550
 we slice the chive in bruno 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.739
 Y 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.739
 i 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 two 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.720
 we also take the sauce 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.000
 in this case it is not so important 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.959
 cut because because as has been crushed 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.959
 I repeat again 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.630
 we throw a little sugar 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.580
 a little bit of vinegar 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.870
 a little salt 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.870
 i 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400
 we put a little pepper and a 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.290
 little bit of spicy paprika always 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.810
 we can correct everything 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.140
 of all the species when we crush 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.260
 the sauce, especially salt and pepper 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 especially the taste of each person 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.780
 we are a little bit of water so that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.780
 cook and soften the onion and mango 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.660
 once the sauce the mango and the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.900
 onion is in this reduced one has 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.510
 softened and the sauce reduced 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 we beat with a nature my arm turn me or 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.250
 a thermomix and we have it and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.730
 this is the result of the sauce once 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.270
 beaten then 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.270
 we place the pork chop 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.810
 we accompany next to our potatoes 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.810
 increase our bakery potatoes 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.040
 we can now place a little to taste 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.040
 every consumer 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.030
 yes 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.030
 Y 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.430
 we proceed with our sauce 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.430
 to cover the pork chops 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.240
 spectacular the colorful of the sauce 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.240
 mango 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.750
 that contrasts very well with the flesh of 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.320
 pig in this case we decorate with a little 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.180
 from thyme 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.480
 to the taste of each person I also return 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.480
 to say 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.160
