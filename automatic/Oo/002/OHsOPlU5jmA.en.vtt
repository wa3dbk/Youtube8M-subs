00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
looks pretty sharp as you can see we

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.670 
looks pretty sharp as you can see we
don't<00:05:44.030> have<00:05:44.240> any<00:05:44.390> noise<00:05:44.630> or<00:05:44.780> something

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.460 

it<00:05:52.250> is<00:05:52.430> pretty<00:05:52.610> sharp<00:05:52.970> again<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.990> am<00:05:54.050> testing

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
it is pretty sharp again I am testing

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.129

the<00:05:54.530> camera<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.979> lot<00:05:55.160> more<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.900> we'll<00:05:56.900> make<00:05:57.110> a

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
the camera a lot more and we'll make a

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.540 
the camera a lot more and we'll make a
camera<00:05:57.530> view<00:06:02.560> so<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.590> think<00:06:03.740> that's<00:06:04.009> it<00:06:04.190> for<00:06:04.220> the

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
camera view so I think that's it for the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.490 
camera view so I think that's it for the
unboxing<00:06:04.699> of<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:06.910> motorola<00:06:07.910> Nexus<00:06:08.300> 6<00:06:08.630> again
