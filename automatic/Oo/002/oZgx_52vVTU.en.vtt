then<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.140> have<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.350> colon<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:02.429> colon<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.909> a

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
then we have the colon the colon is a

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.360 
then we have the colon the colon is a
hollow<00:00:03.300> tube<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.840> goes<00:00:03.899> from<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:05.069> small

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
hollow tube that goes from the small

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.760 
hollow tube that goes from the small
intestine<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> rectum<00:00:06.420> its<00:00:07.109> function<00:00:07.680> is

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
intestine to the rectum its function is

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.860 
intestine to the rectum its function is
to<00:00:07.799> concentrate<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.580> waste<00:00:08.790> into<00:00:09.030> feces<00:00:09.540> it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
to concentrate the waste into feces it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.860 
to concentrate the waste into feces it
absorbs<00:00:10.830> water<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.309> store<00:00:11.759> species<00:00:12.389> until

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
absorbs water and store species until

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.430 
absorbs water and store species until
defecation<00:00:13.880> few<00:00:14.880> electrolytes<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:16.020> also<00:00:16.170> be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
defecation few electrolytes can also be

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.980 
defecation few electrolytes can also be
absorbed<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.449> some<00:00:18.570> special

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
absorbed so here are some special

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
absorbed so here are some special
features<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> colon<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.550> large

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
features of the colon the large

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.480 
features of the colon the large
intestine<00:00:21.300> includes<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> cecum<00:00:22.340> terms<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
intestine includes the cecum terms that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
intestine includes the cecum terms that
you<00:00:23.640> may<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.000> heard<00:00:24.180> before<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.840> colon<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
you may have heard before the colon and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
you may have heard before the colon and
the<00:00:25.380> rectum<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.330> an<00:00:27.449> ileocecal

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the rectum we have an ileocecal

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
the rectum we have an ileocecal
sphincter<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.519> actually<00:00:30.000> between<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
sphincter that is actually between the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
sphincter that is actually between the
ileum<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.380> colon<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.920> remember<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
ileum and the colon so remember that the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060 
ileum and the colon so remember that the
ileum<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.140> last<00:00:34.350> part<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> small

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
ileum is the last part of the small

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
ileum is the last part of the small
intestine<00:00:35.450> that's<00:00:36.450> where<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> ileocecal

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
intestine that's where the ileocecal

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.729 
intestine that's where the ileocecal
sphincter<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.670> located<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
sphincter is located so it's going to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.479 
sphincter is located so it's going to
control<00:00:41.100> passage<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.530> material<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
control passage of material from the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
control passage of material from the
ileum<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> colon<00:00:45.829> then<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> these

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
ileum into the colon then you have these

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
ileum into the colon then you have these
tinea<00:00:47.879> coli<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.230> bands<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
tinea coli which are bands of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
tinea coli which are bands of
longitudinal<00:00:50.430> smooth<00:00:50.879> muscle<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.719> surround

longitudinal smooth muscle that surround

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
longitudinal smooth muscle that surround
the<00:00:52.379> colon<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.489> four<00:00:53.730> sections<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the colon and you have four sections to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
the colon and you have four sections to
the<00:00:54.449> colon<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> very<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.890> part<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> called

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the colon the very first part is called

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
the colon the very first part is called
the<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> sending<00:00:57.210> colon<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.680> contents

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the a sending colon then your contents

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.580 
the a sending colon then your contents
will<00:00:59.309> move<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> transverse<00:01:00.180> colon<00:01:00.590> then

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
will move to the transverse colon then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.549 
will move to the transverse colon then
to<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> descending<00:01:02.730> colon<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.290> then<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to the descending colon and then the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
to the descending colon and then the
last<00:01:04.769> part<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> colon<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.000> little

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
last part of the colon is this little

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.289 
last part of the colon is this little
s-shaped<00:01:07.080> portion<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> looks<00:01:09.210> like

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
s-shaped portion it's kind of looks like

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
s-shaped portion it's kind of looks like
an<00:01:09.510> S<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.470> called<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.220> sigmoid

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
an S right and that's called the sigmoid

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
an S right and that's called the sigmoid
colon<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> contents<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.860> moving<00:01:14.189> from

structure called the appendix and it's
called<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> vermiform<00:01:39.750> appendix<00:01:40.470> because

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
called the vermiform appendix because

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.370 
called the vermiform appendix because
it's<00:01:41.189> worm-like<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.049> recently<00:01:43.049> they

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's worm-like and recently they

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.289 
it's worm-like and recently they
discovered<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> might<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.640> important<00:01:45.180> in

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
discovered that it might be important in

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.340 
discovered that it might be important in
replenishing<00:01:46.399> beneficial<00:01:47.399> gut<00:01:47.640> bacteria<00:01:48.350> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
replenishing beneficial gut bacteria so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.469 
replenishing beneficial gut bacteria so
in<00:01:49.500> other<00:01:49.649> words<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> microbe<00:01:50.880> storehouse

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in other words it's a microbe storehouse

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.820 
in other words it's a microbe storehouse
it<00:01:51.810> stores<00:01:52.590> microbes<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.460> are<00:01:53.520> beneficial
