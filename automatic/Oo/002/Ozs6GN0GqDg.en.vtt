00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
nice we're gonna dig it nice and deep

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.510 
nice we're gonna dig it nice and deep
because<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.690> bury<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.260> pipeline

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
because we have to bury this pipeline

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.130 
because we have to bury this pipeline
what<00:02:23.790> kind<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> pipeline<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> may<00:02:25.080> be

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
what kind of pipeline is it it may be

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.770 
what kind of pipeline is it it may be
it's<00:02:25.320> water<00:02:27.920> okay<00:02:28.920> water<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.730> gas<00:02:30.300> okay

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's water okay water and gas okay

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
it's water okay water and gas okay
she'll<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.830> pipeline<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.490> water<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
she'll have one pipeline for water and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
she'll have one pipeline for water and
one<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.750> gas<00:02:33.930> mm-hmm<00:02:34.970> no<00:02:35.970> mean<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.320> have<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
one for gas mm-hmm no mean you have to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.980 
one for gas mm-hmm no mean you have to
bury<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.040> pipelines<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:39.150> deep<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:41.990> one

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
bury the pipelines really deep right one

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.300 
bury the pipelines really deep right one
for<00:02:43.200> fuel<00:02:43.470> yeah<00:02:43.680> well<00:02:44.160> guess<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.790> school

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.030 

sewer<00:02:51.350> sewage<00:02:52.350> drain<00:02:53.420> okay<00:02:54.530> dude

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
sewer sewage drain okay dude

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
sewer sewage drain okay dude
now<00:02:56.520> when<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.850> bury<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.240> pipeline<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.470> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
now when you bury a pipeline you have to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.230 
now when you bury a pipeline you have to
make<00:02:58.740> vigorously<00:02:59.310> these<00:02:59.490> teeth<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
make vigorously these teeth you have to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.800 
make vigorously these teeth you have to
make<00:03:00.360> sure<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.510> bury<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.990> deep<00:03:01.020> oh<00:03:05.510> yes<00:03:06.510> there's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
make sure to bury it deep oh yes there's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.170 
make sure to bury it deep oh yes there's
a<00:03:06.870> road<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.680> goes<00:03:07.740> right<00:03:08.310> over<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.060> we

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
a road that goes right over this so we

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.300 
a road that goes right over this so we
have<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.360> bury<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.750> deep<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.130> they

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
have to bury it deep so that so they

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.800 
have to bury it deep so that so they
don't<00:03:11.489> hurt<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.820> pipes<00:03:12.060> whenever<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:12.600> drive

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
don't hurt the pipes whenever they drive

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.110 
don't hurt the pipes whenever they drive
over<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.769> right<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.880> ready<00:03:14.910> to

this<00:03:35.610> could<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.910> our<00:03:35.940> pipeline<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:37.470> route

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
this could be our pipeline that route

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.570 
this could be our pipeline that route
yeah<00:03:39.530> dude<00:03:40.530> okay<00:03:40.709> all<00:03:41.130> right<00:03:41.250> wait
