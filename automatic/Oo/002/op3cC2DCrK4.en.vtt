00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.230
 but of life of hi to all 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.340
 today I'm here to talk about the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 victims or the viu tibán or the bleu same 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 that is a baby killing many of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 you probably already know what 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 is a baby cream also known or 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.180
 well his name comes from the term big 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 band or bleu itself a bicrim is a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.060
 mix between moisturizer with color 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 which is a mixture of several things 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.210
 then in Spain it was not known 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.660
 in fact they come from Southeast Asia and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.850
 its function is a mixture of how 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.220
 we started I have commented to moisturize the skin 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 also cover imperfections and the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.600
 true we a little bit of color but without 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.900
 that covers so much or overwhelms us so much 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.480
 skin with makeup 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.700
 I specifically have only tried and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.240
 I only have 2 vikings that would be 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.770
 are you here from kiko in the rose tone 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.320
 03 and the one of l'oréal news magic in the tone 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.000
 of medium skin for you to make a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.520
 idea I am more I have about the tone of nw 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 1820 is then worth good more or less 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.690
 to pray 6 with the theme of the tones 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.550
 I'm going to talk a little bit about each of 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.880
 because I do not want to get tangled 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.590
 There is not much more to tell 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 well let's see the differences or the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.660
 similarities between the kiko cream and the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.700
 de l'oréal as you can see the packaging is very 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.530
 similar 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 It is quite similar 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 and as for price that of kiko round 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.840
 good are 8 90 and the one of l'oréal announce 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 on TV that costs less than 10 euros 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 I bought it in my case in the hipercor 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.369
 from here of Cordoba cost me 830 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.979
 more differences in the one of kiko has a 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.760
 sun protection factor of 15 and that of 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.670
 the real 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.580
 mehdi has a protection factor of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.070
 12 next solar protection 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 difference if we uncover the containers 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.860
 this is Kiko's and this is the one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.500
 l'oreal you will see that the nozzles are 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.709
 different the l'oréal is more finite and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.900
 the one of kiko is thicker plus chubby 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.030
 both come the blanquita cream with 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.420
 microcapsules that have the properties 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.180
 and the color and once we apply them 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.780
 is when we say they are going to explode they go to 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.780
 extract the capsules 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.150
 in both cases the cream the content 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.610
 it comes in white color and they have inside 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.550
 of some microcapsules that in the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.970
 l'oréal or describes it better comes here 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.040
 Color pigments encapsulated their os 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.500
 Mons are released at the time of 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.710
 application to minimize shadows and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.260
 imperfections I lived it clean I like it 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.750
 use it apply with this type of brush 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.820
 or the synthetic for make-up in fact 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.610
 I do not use make - up you know that 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.890
 me for makeup I use the skunk and the 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.260
 Synthetic often used for this type of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.330
 creams because I put it here or in 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.820
 hand I apply and when 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.060
 apply it because I know that with the pressure of 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.800
 the most direct brush the capsules go to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.660
 better off the properties and the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.750
 color so good this is my way 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.060
 favorite to apply one more division 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.580
 texture difference of l'oréal 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.180
 It has a pretty liquid texture 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.990
 if you see I'm going to throw here a little 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.710
 Let's see 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.900
 you see that each lake has a lot more 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.900
 liquid and that of kiko 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.250
 it's more dense 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.890
 the two are very similar has great a 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.340
 landmark is the L'Oreal and this is the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.390
 boy once he extends it would be 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.390
 when I'm going to take color 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.250
 that of kiko costs more than one subject together 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.470
 more pasty to me I do not like so much the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.860
 from kiko 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.720
 and of color because nothing I do not know if with the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.140
 camera you are going to be able to appreciate and 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.550
 I think not but the two colors are very 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.049
 Similar 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.090
 ok but texture I like 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.459
 Quite a lot more, l'oreal is done to me 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.810
 less heavy on the face and I like it more 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.330
 all 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.229
 and another difference would be the smell 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.849
 la de l'oréal does not smell so much does not smell and 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.240
 however the happiness is that it smells 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.680
 like to glue to plastic ah I do not know no 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.289
 I know if it will be because it takes too many 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.100
 silicones or something but I do not like the 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.770
 smell of the disc 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.380
 Another live and well known here in Spain 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.170
 for being the first to get it out was 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.340
 I have not tried the honey one because 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.170
 when I was going to buy it when 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.540
 they said it was pretty fat I did not 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.420
 I bought it that was not good either 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.670
 Good thing, I have not bought it and 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.670
 other well-known brands of bibi 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.870
 cream are my yes to that I would like 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.430
 try the skin 79 but for the time being 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.820
 are the two that I have tried are the two 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.430
 of which I can give you my opinion 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.560
 As for the finish, nothing both 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.390
 equal in the peeled third perhaps the 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.060
 kiko to me I have more rise of 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.070
 color I do not know why and the one of l'oréal yes 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.569
 that this improvement is given to my tone of 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.669
 skin 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.499
 but nothing the two well cover 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.080
 imperfections good I more than cover 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.209
 imperfections I would say that what they do is 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.919
 cover a little bit the redness also because 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.349
 imperfections if you have a granite or 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.610
 a little scar I do not think you 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.590
 cover it 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.800
 and nothing good as you may have guessed 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.250
 my favorite between the two is the one of what 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.409
 real or in magic because the application 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.050
 it's much easier, it does not make 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:54.110
 to start on the skin the smell is not 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.590
 so cantoso and also cost me more 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.530
 baratitas so for me perfect the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.020
 two expire 12 months once 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.550
 open the product worth this is the 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.830
 expiration of the products can be seen 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.560
 here this jar that is here behind in 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.900
 the products to see if you see it worth it is 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.190
 like an open jar and it comes 12 m 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.729
 36 m 6 m those are the months that lasts 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.860
 since you have opened it 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.889
 they contain the same amount of product 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.749
 30 milliliters and nothing else on my part 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.349
 I do not want to spread much more because 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:31.449
 there is no more to count between me 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.870
 the two would stay with corn 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:37.089
 l'oreal and surely repeat so 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.310
 nothing more to say or I park as 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:45.680
 always thanks for watching me 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.680
 vidal and your life said
