00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
you need to do an effective edge tuning

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.460 
you need to do an effective edge tuning
on<00:00:25.789> your<00:00:26.000> skis<00:00:26.270> now<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:26.930> first<00:00:27.199> thing<00:00:27.350> you

this on top of the ski you what it what
it<00:00:31.430> rests<00:00:31.820> on<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:32.570> can<00:00:32.689> see<00:00:32.870> here<00:00:33.110> I've<00:00:33.260> got<00:00:33.290> a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
it rests on you can see here I've got a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.530 
it rests on you can see here I've got a
sawhorse<00:00:33.710> set<00:00:34.250> up<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:35.239> could<00:00:35.360> certainly

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
sawhorse set up but you could certainly

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.430 
sawhorse set up but you could certainly
set<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.110> up<00:00:36.320> off<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.530> workbench<00:00:37.010> as<00:00:37.970> well<00:00:38.440> so

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
set this up off a workbench as well so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.810 
set this up off a workbench as well so
along<00:00:39.830> with<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.070> ski<00:00:40.280> vice<00:00:40.430> you're<00:00:40.699> gonna

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
along with the ski vice you're gonna

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.850 
along with the ski vice you're gonna
need<00:00:40.970> some<00:00:41.150> things<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.600> actually<00:00:42.559> get<00:00:42.710> these

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
need some things to actually get these

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.060 
need some things to actually get these
breaks<00:00:43.280> out<00:00:43.519> of<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.760> way<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.019> this<00:00:45.500> break

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
breaks out of the way and so this break

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.240 
breaks out of the way and so this break
retainer<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.030> these<00:00:47.989> rubber<00:00:48.199> bands<00:00:48.500> will

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
retainer and these rubber bands will

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.250 
retainer and these rubber bands will
help<00:00:49.400> us<00:00:49.549> do<00:00:49.729> that<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.089> this<00:00:50.420> retainer<00:00:50.839> here

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
help us do that this this retainer here

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.740 
help us do that this this retainer here
will<00:00:51.799> set<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.280> ski<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.670> keep<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.000> on<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.390> on

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
will set the ski and keep it on the on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.539 
will set the ski and keep it on the on
the<00:00:54.019> vise<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.620> this<00:00:54.739> will<00:00:54.920> get<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.190> actual

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
the vise and this will get the actual

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.259 
the vise and this will get the actual
breaks<00:00:55.970> out<00:00:56.900> of<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.080> way<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:59.000> reason

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
breaks out of the way and so the reason

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.000 
breaks out of the way and so the reason
we<00:00:59.360> tune<00:00:59.600> edges<00:01:00.019> is<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.589> we<00:01:00.710> want<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:00.920> make

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
we tune edges is that we want to make

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.710 
we tune edges is that we want to make
sure<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.369> our<00:01:01.430> edges<00:01:02.119> are<00:01:02.239> really<00:01:02.449> sharp

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
sure that our edges are really sharp

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.810 
sure that our edges are really sharp
once<00:01:03.650> they<00:01:03.830> get<00:01:03.949> dull<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.400> can<00:01:04.519> really<00:01:04.699> make

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
once they get dull you can really make

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.180 
once they get dull you can really make
the<00:01:04.940> skiing<00:01:05.239> experience<00:01:06.110> difficult<00:01:06.950> for<00:01:07.130> your

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
the skiing experience difficult for your

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.370 
the skiing experience difficult for your
family<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.600> here<00:01:08.750> are<00:01:08.840> some<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.140> tools

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
family and so here are some of the tools

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.889 
family and so here are some of the tools
that<00:01:09.979> you're<00:01:10.100> going<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.250> need<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:11.329> have<00:01:11.479> have

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
that you're going to need to have have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.859 
that you're going to need to have have
these<00:01:12.109> edges<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:13.159> place<00:01:13.399> so<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.299> tool<00:01:14.689> right

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
these edges in place so this tool right

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.990 
these edges in place so this tool right
here<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.259> just<00:01:15.409> a<00:01:15.500> little<00:01:15.740> stone<00:01:16.009> what<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:16.850> is

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
here is just a little stone what this is

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.670 
here is just a little stone what this is
used<00:01:17.210> for<00:01:17.359> is<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.780> actually<00:01:17.899> knock<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.469> burrs

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
used for is to actually knock the burrs

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.300 
used for is to actually knock the burrs
off<00:01:19.579> off<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.240> edges<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.109> ski<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:22.189> is

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
off off the edges of the ski and this is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.679 
off off the edges of the ski and this is
if<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:22.520> run<00:01:22.670> over<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.880> rock<00:01:23.119> or<00:01:23.299> something<00:01:23.570> like

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
if you run over a rock or something like

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.260 
if you run over a rock or something like
that<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.859> mountain<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.820> little<00:01:26.090> gummy

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
that on the mountain this little gummy

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.149 
that on the mountain this little gummy
stone<00:01:26.570> right<00:01:26.750> here<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.590> get<00:01:27.679> all<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.950> rust

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
stone right here is to get all the rust

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.130 
stone right here is to get all the rust
off<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.609> can<00:01:28.729> see<00:01:28.969> it's<00:01:29.149> it's<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.600> rusty

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
off that you can see it's it's a rusty

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.630 
off that you can see it's it's a rusty
color<00:01:30.289> so<00:01:30.590> I've<00:01:30.710> certainly<00:01:30.950> got<00:01:31.130> some<00:01:31.460> rust

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
color so I've certainly got some rust

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.700 
color so I've certainly got some rust
off<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> edges<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.450> skis<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.500> rust

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
off the edges of the skis but rust

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.349 
off the edges of the skis but rust
happens<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.520> get<00:01:34.670> some<00:01:34.999> water

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
happens when you get some water

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.149 
happens when you get some water
staying<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.170> them<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:36.469> this<00:01:36.649> will<00:01:36.829> just<00:01:36.859> take

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
staying on them but this will just take

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.819 
staying on them but this will just take
it<00:01:37.280> right<00:01:37.399> off<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:38.210> tool<00:01:38.479> right<00:01:38.749> here<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:39.350> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
it right off this tool right here is the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.480 
it right off this tool right here is the
actual<00:01:40.249> edge<00:01:40.939> thing<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.200> use<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.740> file

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
actual edge thing that you use to file

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.940 
actual edge thing that you use to file
and<00:01:43.880> polish<00:01:44.270> your<00:01:45.049> edges<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:45.590> has<00:01:45.740> some

get started we're going to need to

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.020 
get started we're going to need to
attach<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:46.019> ski<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.549> base<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
attach the ski to the to the base and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.240 
attach the ski to the to the base and
get<00:02:48.599> these<00:02:48.780> breaks<00:02:49.079> out<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.440> way<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.099> so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
get these breaks out of the way and so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.160 
get these breaks out of the way and so
the<00:02:50.370> first<00:02:50.519> thing<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.030> breaks<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.599> with

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the first thing with the breaks is with

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.319 
the first thing with the breaks is with
the<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.650> rubber<00:02:52.980> band<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.849> can<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.150> take

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
the just a rubber band you can just take

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.509 
the just a rubber band you can just take
these<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.650> wrap<00:02:55.920> them<00:02:56.069> right<00:02:56.250> around

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
these and just wrap them right around

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.099 
these and just wrap them right around
and<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.639> just<00:02:59.849> get<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.720> breaks<00:03:00.930> all

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
and that just get to see the breaks all

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.860 
and that just get to see the breaks all
the<00:03:01.200> way<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.859> surface<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:03.510> work<00:03:03.659> on

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the way so you have a surface to work on

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.210 
the way so you have a surface to work on
that's<00:03:04.049> free<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.440> breaks<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.099> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that's free of the breaks and then the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.680 
that's free of the breaks and then the
other<00:03:05.370> thing<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.120> wrap<00:03:06.329> this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
other thing you do is just wrap this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.759 
other thing you do is just wrap this
right<00:03:07.650> around<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.010> binding<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.709> there's<00:03:10.709> a

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
right around the binding and there's a

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.530 
right around the binding and there's a
when<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.430> buy<00:03:11.579> your<00:03:11.790> vise<00:03:11.940> usually<00:03:12.389> get<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
when you buy your vise usually get a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.599 
when you buy your vise usually get a
tool<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.620> allows<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> attach

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
tool like this that allows you to attach

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.930 
tool like this that allows you to attach
the<00:03:14.909> ski<00:03:15.139> right<00:03:16.139> to<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:17.609> your<00:03:17.760> ski

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the ski right to the to your ski

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.020 
the ski right to the to your ski
equipment<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.930> first<00:03:19.139> step<00:03:19.349> here<00:03:19.379> in<00:03:19.709> our

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
equipment so the first step here in our

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.250 
equipment so the first step here in our
sharpening<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> edges<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.629> get<00:03:21.750> any<00:03:21.900> rust

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
sharpening the edges is to get any rust

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.920 
sharpening the edges is to get any rust
and<00:03:22.620> off<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.340> edge<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.669> you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.840> we

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and off the edge so you can see here we

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.449 
and off the edge so you can see here we
got<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.079> little<00:03:25.169> bit<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.410> rust<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.889> ski<00:03:26.099> so

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
got a little bit of rust on this ski so

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.280 
got a little bit of rust on this ski so
what<00:03:27.030> we're<00:03:27.120> gonna<00:03:27.209> do<00:03:27.449> is<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.870> use<00:03:28.109> this

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
what we're gonna do is just use this

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.280 
what we're gonna do is just use this
gummy<00:03:28.560> stone<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.340> just<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:30.389> along<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.079> top

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
gummy stone and just go along the top

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
gummy stone and just go along the top
edge<00:03:31.680> or<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.250> base<00:03:32.400> edge<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.910> ski<00:03:34.910> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
edge or the base edge of the ski and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.580 
edge or the base edge of the ski and
then<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.359> there's<00:03:36.510> any<00:03:36.599> rust<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.169> side<00:03:37.379> you

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
then if there's any rust on the side you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.559 
then if there's any rust on the side you
can<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.919> same<00:03:38.129> thing<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:41.299> going<00:03:42.299> up<00:03:42.419> and

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
can do the same thing just going up and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.119 
can do the same thing just going up and
down<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.810> ski<00:03:43.019> making<00:03:43.349> sure<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.650> rust<00:03:43.859> free

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
down your ski making sure it's rust free

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.059 
down your ski making sure it's rust free
will<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.699> help<00:03:44.849> your<00:03:45.090> edge<00:03:45.629> bevel<00:03:46.049> tools<00:03:46.290> in

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
will just help your edge bevel tools in

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.970 
will just help your edge bevel tools in

used for is to basically get any of the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.089 
used for is to basically get any of the
tuff<00:03:54.480> burrs<00:03:54.750> off<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.500> edge<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> ski<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
tuff burrs off the edge of the ski you

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.770 
tuff burrs off the edge of the ski you
might<00:03:56.250> hit<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> rock<00:03:56.669> or<00:03:56.970> another<00:03:57.299> piece<00:03:57.569> of

might hit a rock or another piece of

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.750 
might hit a rock or another piece of
debris<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.319> trail<00:03:58.560> it'll<00:03:59.430> give<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.730> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
debris on the trail it'll give you a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.750 
debris on the trail it'll give you a
little<00:04:00.239> bump<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.199> your<00:04:01.470> edge<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.069> what<00:04:02.609> this

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
little bump in your edge so what this

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.000 
little bump in your edge so what this
tool<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.359> just<00:04:03.540> run<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.780> down<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.379> base<00:04:04.799> of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
tool is you just run it down the base of

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.030 
tool is you just run it down the base of
the<00:04:05.099> ski<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.379> just<00:04:07.379> you'll<00:04:07.769> feel

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the ski like this and just you'll feel

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.970 
the ski like this and just you'll feel
it<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.400> it'll<00:04:09.389> just<00:04:09.659> knock<00:04:09.810> down<00:04:09.870> any<00:04:10.290> burrs

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it and it'll just knock down any burrs

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.699 
it and it'll just knock down any burrs
or<00:04:11.870> imperfections<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.049> edge<00:04:13.199> of<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.440> ski

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
or imperfections in the edge of the ski

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.460 
or imperfections in the edge of the ski
and<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.430> do<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.729> on<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.239> both<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.840> bases

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and you can do that on on both the bases

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.129 
and you can do that on on both the bases
edge<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.459> side<00:04:17.669> edge<00:04:17.849> as<00:04:18.000> well<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
edge and the side edge as well just a

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.629 
edge and the side edge as well just a
couple<00:04:19.650> passes<00:04:19.799> up<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.280> down<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> ski

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
couple passes up and down the ski

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.069 
couple passes up and down the ski
usually<00:04:20.909> that's<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.180> trick

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
usually that's the trick

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.920 
usually that's the trick
Steph<00:04:22.259> is<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.800> actually<00:04:23.069> filing<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.539> edges<00:04:24.810> of

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
Steph is is actually filing the edges of

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.929 
Steph is is actually filing the edges of
the<00:04:25.020> skis<00:04:25.259> so<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> first<00:04:25.830> thing<00:04:26.069> is<00:04:26.580> we<00:04:26.819> need

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
the skis so the first thing is we need

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.689 
the skis so the first thing is we need
to<00:04:27.000> talk<00:04:27.210> about<00:04:27.240> his<00:04:27.659> edge<00:04:27.900> angle<00:04:28.229> now<00:04:29.009> if<00:04:29.550> you

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
to talk about his edge angle now if you

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.550 
to talk about his edge angle now if you
go<00:04:29.879> online<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.389> read<00:04:30.569> about<00:04:30.689> edge<00:04:31.050> angle<00:04:31.229> on

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
go online and read about edge angle on

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.869 
go online and read about edge angle on
skis<00:04:31.889> there's<00:04:32.189> certainly<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.639> lot<00:04:32.849> of

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
skis there's certainly a lot of

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.850 
skis there's certainly a lot of
different<00:04:33.719> theories<00:04:34.110> on<00:04:34.229> what<00:04:34.379> angles<00:04:34.770> you

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
different theories on what angles you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.159 
different theories on what angles you
should<00:04:35.039> set<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.909> basic<00:04:36.270> family<00:04:36.509> skiing<00:04:36.990> what

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
should set for basic family skiing what

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.709 
should set for basic family skiing what
I<00:04:37.199> recommend<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:38.370> setting<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:38.969> angle<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.659> your

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
I recommend is setting the angle on your

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.320 
I recommend is setting the angle on your
tool<00:04:40.259> here<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:41.039> be<00:04:41.159> one<00:04:41.400> degree<00:04:41.759> for<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.120> base

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
tool here to be one degree for the base

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.020 
tool here to be one degree for the base
and<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.409> the<00:04:43.500> side<00:04:43.710> what<00:04:44.069> that<00:04:44.099> means<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.879> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
and for the side what that means is the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.959 
and for the side what that means is the
angle<00:04:45.509> is<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.319> angle<00:04:46.590> off<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.490> ski<00:04:47.729> like<00:04:47.939> this

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
angle is the angle off the ski like this

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.029 
angle is the angle off the ski like this
and<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.419> just<00:04:48.599> allows<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.139> ski<00:04:49.439> to<00:04:49.770> rock<00:04:50.009> a

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
and that just allows the ski to rock a

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.429 
and that just allows the ski to rock a
little<00:04:50.430> bit<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.819> it<00:04:51.449> allows<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.930> get<00:04:52.229> into

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
little bit and it allows you to get into

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.499 
little bit and it allows you to get into
your<00:04:52.590> turn<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:52.919> little<00:04:53.129> bit<00:04:53.310> better<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.879> 1<00:04:54.330> degree

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
your turn a little bit better a 1 degree

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.809 
your turn a little bit better a 1 degree
angle<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.440> base<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:56.009> 1<00:04:56.159> degree<00:04:56.310> angle

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
angle on the base and a 1 degree angle

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.999 
angle on the base and a 1 degree angle
on<00:04:56.969> the<00:04:57.120> side<00:04:57.379> generally<00:04:58.379> it's<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.710> best

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
on the side generally it's the best

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.879 
on the side generally it's the best
angle<00:04:59.729> for<00:04:59.759> most<00:05:00.090> families<00:05:00.659> ski<00:05:01.050> setups<00:05:01.440> so

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
angle for most families ski setups so

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.439 
angle for most families ski setups so
now<00:05:01.979> we're<00:05:02.099> ready<00:05:02.159> to<00:05:02.280> use<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> file<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.270> as

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
now we're ready to use the file and as

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.450 
now we're ready to use the file and as
you<00:05:03.569> notice<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.139> file<00:05:04.409> is<00:05:04.680> an<00:05:04.830> arrow<00:05:05.129> what

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
you notice on the file is an arrow what

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.189 
you notice on the file is an arrow what
that<00:05:05.610> arrow<00:05:05.879> means<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.479> you<00:05:06.569> need<00:05:06.719> to<00:05:06.750> use<00:05:07.020> this

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
that arrow means is you need to use this

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.980 
that arrow means is you need to use this
file<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.919> one<00:05:08.729> direction<00:05:08.969> and<00:05:09.569> you<00:05:09.690> want<00:05:09.900> to

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
file in one direction and you want to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.260 
file in one direction and you want to
use<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.349> from<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.650> tip<00:05:10.919> of<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.129> ski<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
use it from the tip of the ski to the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.760 
use it from the tip of the ski to the
tail<00:05:12.509> so<00:05:12.810> it's<00:05:12.960> important<00:05:13.379> that<00:05:13.409> you<00:05:13.620> know

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
tail so it's important that you know

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.950 
tail so it's important that you know
where<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.729> arrow<00:05:14.940> is<00:05:15.180> when<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.479> fit<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.810> into

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
where the arrow is when you fit it into

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.589 
where the arrow is when you fit it into
the<00:05:16.229> tool<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.279> when<00:05:17.550> you're<00:05:17.969> ready<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.270> do<00:05:18.419> the

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
the tool so when you're ready to do the

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.540 
the tool so when you're ready to do the
the<00:05:18.629> base<00:05:19.229> with<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.590> particular<00:05:20.099> tool<00:05:20.310> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
the base with this particular tool it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.269 
the base with this particular tool it
slides<00:05:20.969> in<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.539> like<00:05:21.659> this<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.229> there's<00:05:23.189> a

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
slides in just like this and there's a

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.059 
slides in just like this and there's a
couple<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:24.229> tighteners<00:05:25.229> here<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.949> just

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
couple of tighteners here you just

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.670 
couple of tighteners here you just
tighten<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.490> down<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.020> then<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.259> set<00:05:28.469> it<00:05:28.590> on

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
tighten it down and then you set it on

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.490 
tighten it down and then you set it on
the<00:05:28.889> base<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.580> go<00:05:29.699> tip<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.150> tail<00:05:30.500> like

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
the base and you go tip the tail like

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.249 
the base and you go tip the tail like
this<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:33.120> use<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:33.779> the<00:05:34.110> side<00:05:34.590> angle<00:05:36.259> what

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
this to use this on the side angle what

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.269 
this to use this on the side angle what
you're<00:05:37.409> going<00:05:37.529> to<00:05:37.589> do<00:05:37.740> is<00:05:37.949> you're<00:05:38.099> going<00:05:38.129> to

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.110 
you're going to do is you're going to
fit<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.610> in<00:05:38.990> right<00:05:39.990> here

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
fit it in right here

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.300 
fit it in right here
and<00:05:42.120> again<00:05:42.600> tighten<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.350> up<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:47.010> then<00:05:47.190> with

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
and again tighten it up and then with

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.190 
and again tighten it up and then with
this<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.730> will<00:05:47.880> hit<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.180> base<00:05:48.390> of<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.840> side

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
this this will hit the base of the side

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.500 
this this will hit the base of the side
angle<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.770> ski<00:05:50.010> and<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.760> use<00:05:51.030> this<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.480> one

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
angle of the ski and you use this in one

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:07.610 
angle of the ski and you use this in one
direction<00:06:05.840> now<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:06.990> we've<00:06:07.080> got<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.350> edges

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
direction now that we've got the edges

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.770 
direction now that we've got the edges
filed<00:06:07.920> it's<00:06:08.190> time<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.700> polish<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:09.360> edges<00:06:09.630> the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
filed it's time to polish the edges the

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.810 
filed it's time to polish the edges the
file<00:06:10.050> does<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.620> good<00:06:10.740> job<00:06:10.800> sharpening<00:06:11.550> but<00:06:11.700> we

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
file does a good job sharpening but we

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.460 
file does a good job sharpening but we
need<00:06:11.970> to<00:06:12.060> polish<00:06:12.420> to<00:06:12.540> get<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.780> things<00:06:13.020> mirror

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470
