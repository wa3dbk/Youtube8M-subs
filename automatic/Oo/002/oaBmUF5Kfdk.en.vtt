00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
just changed in my video um I just kind

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.830 
just changed in my video um I just kind
of<00:02:37.330> guessed<00:02:38.260> where<00:02:38.530> those<00:02:38.710> would<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.630> go

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
of guessed where those would be so I go

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.750 
of guessed where those would be so I go
over<00:02:40.990> here<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.410> arm<00:02:41.680> try<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.490> make<00:02:42.670> it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
over here on this arm try to make it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.990 
over here on this arm try to make it
look<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.210> kind<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.450> bent<00:02:43.770> at<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.830> elbow

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
look like it's kind of bent at the elbow

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.910 
look like it's kind of bent at the elbow
so<00:02:46.000> it's<00:02:46.180> kind<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.770> doesn't<00:02:47.770> really

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
so it's kind of like that doesn't really

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.560 
so it's kind of like that doesn't really
look<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.790> good

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
look that good

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.090 
look that good
it's<00:02:50.260> got<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> shadow<00:02:50.830> from<00:02:51.430> his<00:02:51.520> head<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.800> um<00:02:53.800> I

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
it's got a shadow from his head and um I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.390 
it's got a shadow from his head and um I
think<00:02:54.490> he<00:02:54.700> turned<00:02:54.850> out<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.630> well<00:02:56.370> let<00:02:57.370> me

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
think he turned out pretty well let me

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
think he turned out pretty well let me
know<00:02:57.550> what<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:57.880> again<00:02:58.150> these<00:02:58.300> aren't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
know what you think again these aren't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.630 
know what you think again these aren't
really<00:02:58.630> supposed<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.770> super<00:03:00.250> detailed

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
really supposed to be super detailed

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.600 
really supposed to be super detailed
drawings<00:03:01.120> they're<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.320> uh<00:03:02.530> sketches<00:03:03.370> pretty

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
drawings they're just uh sketches pretty

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.570 
drawings they're just uh sketches pretty
much<00:03:03.790> there's<00:03:04.270> another<00:03:04.450> look<00:03:04.660> at<00:03:04.750> his<00:03:04.870> face<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
much there's another look at his face I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.880 
much there's another look at his face I
think<00:03:06.580> his<00:03:06.670> nose<00:03:07.090> turned<00:03:07.690> out<00:03:07.900> pretty<00:03:08.709> well

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
think his nose turned out pretty well

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.310 
think his nose turned out pretty well
I've<00:03:09.490> never<00:03:09.760> been<00:03:10.090> good<00:03:10.300> at<00:03:10.360> drawing<00:03:10.690> Jason's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320

uh<00:03:11.650> hockey<00:03:12.610> masks<00:03:13.000> nose<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.070> think<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.850> looks

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
uh hockey masks nose so I think it looks

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.180 
uh hockey masks nose so I think it looks
decent

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
decent

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.110 
decent
I<00:03:19.380> think<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.500> oh<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:21.400> mask<00:03:21.670> could<00:03:21.940> be<00:03:22.090> a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
I think the oh the mask could be a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.800 
I think the oh the mask could be a
little<00:03:22.390> smaller<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.170> looks<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.470> little<00:03:23.650> fat<00:03:24.130> but

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
little smaller it looks a little fat but

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.810 
little smaller it looks a little fat but
uh<00:03:25.980> let<00:03:26.980> me<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.100> what<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> guys<00:03:27.520> think

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
