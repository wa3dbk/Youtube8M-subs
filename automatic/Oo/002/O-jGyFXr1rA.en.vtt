00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
right direction now I'm gonna let this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
right direction now I'm gonna let this
video<00:01:09.900> run<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> end<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> lap<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
video run to the end of the lap so you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.410 
video run to the end of the lap so you
can<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.340> idea<00:01:11.700> visually<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
can get an idea visually of what the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
can get an idea visually of what the
netcode<00:01:12.630> looks<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> how<00:01:13.770> things<00:01:14.040> have

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
netcode looks like and how things have

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.700 
netcode looks like and how things have
improved<00:01:14.280> since<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> update<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.600> course<00:01:16.560> keep
