00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.490
 it's still pretty big so with 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.820
 this famous charging cable 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.070
 so that's him this specific cable 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:19.999
 loaded on autolib or on cats if 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.749
 you enter the ancient port 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.749
 sweet smile 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 pretty classy also the wrists coming out 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 like that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.800
 that the tap is also controlled by a 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.090
 for an enable to connect 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.739
 okay 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.219
 here is learn branch free water in it 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.079
 he is now and he is stuck 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.949
 nobody can do it 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.059
 here and we plug directly 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.030
 use for example 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.170
 autolib but we will only have 20 km to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.269
 the hour and more is charged 1 euro 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 say extremely expensive and with the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.619
 risk of getting fucked by the car 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.130
 by drivers to the public who are 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.720
 not all 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.640
 and then to adapters so for the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.190
 tips for connecting to a goal of 120 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.720
 that's the specific term charge 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.020
 fast otherwise and delivered two clis the kit 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:29.600
 complete antipolis connection 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.399
 find the same charging cable that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 will go on taking are of little 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.159
 type 2 and we have a system of 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.380
 adapter that allows to put by 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.179
 example a 220 plug for recharging 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.789
 at home at 20 km / hour as at home 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.890
 beam but with a price lower than 70 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.740
 euros 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 from their office or possibly a 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:57.070
 motorhome type at the campsite on 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.430
 on the 220 32 years please no memory 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.550
 or three-phase 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.920
 four hundred flights because 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.380
 it loses so knowing that with that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.600
 is recharged km / h there is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.960
 search about 30 or 32 kilometers 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.960
 per hour 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.490
 and I believe I'm trying to use myself so I 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.200
 am not on numbers and facts 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.190
 in the documentation I believe that there 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.260
 is able to climb to 50 and 55 km by 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 time while with these we can 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.640
 climb to 110 kilometers a year that I 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.540
 complete recharge in one search 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.250
 complete we will say three hours three 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.910
 half hours because we 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.810
 in practice we rarely go down or 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.040
 2.64 margins 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.540
 Yes we 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.480
 we will say that this is the reserve were 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 have told themselves he knows how to find 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.969
 a lot of charging available in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.299
 Paris region via the application 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.090
 charm since you can load in the ch 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.260
 and Leclerc and Auchan 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.939
 at aeroville again at ikea 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 also at nissan and renault 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.980
 renault the concessions 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.409
 sas free access is not in access 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.060
 free renault group policy and 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.020
 of nissan says they have to open the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.000
 bounds 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.980
 to everyone in practice it's 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.320
 too complicated either because the terminal 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.000
 very poorly installed either because there is 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.230
 cars in front of you because the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.460
 concession of the green skins which is 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.860
 because the word stop to green or 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.860
 outright he refuses access it happens
