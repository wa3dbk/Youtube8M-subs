00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
they minutes they don't drop all at all

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.289 
they minutes they don't drop all at all
I<00:03:06.079> know<00:03:06.590> there<00:03:06.889> was<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> bit<00:03:07.340> time<00:03:08.000> little

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
I know there was a bit time little

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.449 
I know there was a bit time little
period<00:03:08.510> when<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.930> was<00:03:09.139> no<00:03:09.409> wool<00:03:10.129> if<00:03:10.370> you

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
period when there was no wool if you

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.129 
period when there was no wool if you
didn't<00:03:10.700> use<00:03:10.819> this<00:03:10.970> year's<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.569> he<00:03:11.840> used<00:03:12.019> to

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
didn't use this year's so he used to

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.899 
didn't use this year's so he used to
little<00:03:12.349> iron<00:03:12.530> ingots<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.099> use<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.760> get

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
little iron ingots and use this to get

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.140 
little iron ingots and use this to get
wool<00:03:14.299> from<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.720> sheep<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.280> um<00:03:16.280> you're<00:03:17.030> going

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
wool from the sheep and um you're going

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.640 
wool from the sheep and um you're going
to<00:03:17.269> have<00:03:17.389> to<00:03:17.540> use<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.079> be<00:03:18.199> able<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.440> get

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
to have to use this to be able to get

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.369 
to have to use this to be able to get
leaf<00:03:19.639> blocks<00:03:20.060> from<00:03:20.329> trees<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.959> instead<00:03:21.290> of

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
leaf blocks from trees to instead of

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.020 
leaf blocks from trees to instead of
just<00:03:21.560> hitting<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.459> being<00:03:22.579> able<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.790> pick<00:03:22.910> them

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
just hitting and being able to pick them

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.740 
just hitting and being able to pick them
up<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:23.359> you<00:03:23.419> got<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.780> use<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.019> shears<00:03:24.290> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
up now you got to use the shears and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.050 
up now you got to use the shears and
pistons<00:03:26.750> good<00:03:27.440> old<00:03:27.620> Pistons<00:03:28.129> as<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.849> can<00:03:28.910> see

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
pistons good old Pistons as you can see

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.729 
pistons good old Pistons as you can see
it<00:03:29.120> requires<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:30.139> know<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.290> little<00:03:30.440> bit<00:03:30.530> more

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
it requires you know a little bit more

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.890 
it requires you know a little bit more
resources<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.340> do<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.660> make<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
resources to do that but you make a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.930 
resources to do that but you make a
standard<00:03:33.349> piston<00:03:33.769> just<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> stuff<00:03:34.819> you

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
standard piston just with a stuff you

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.520 
standard piston just with a stuff you
see<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.359> or<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.599> can<00:03:35.629> make<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.930> sticky<00:03:36.319> piston

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
see here or you can make a sticky piston

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.379 
see here or you can make a sticky piston
so<00:03:36.949> once<00:03:37.099> you've<00:03:37.250> made<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.519> piston<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.180> throw

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
so once you've made the piston you throw

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.330 
so once you've made the piston you throw
a<00:03:38.449> slime<00:03:38.720> ball<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.079> there<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.919> got<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.099> sticky

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
a slime ball on there and I got a sticky

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.220 
a slime ball on there and I got a sticky
piston<00:03:40.669> like<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.660> said<00:03:41.750> I'm<00:03:41.870> not<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.169> go

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
piston like I said I'm not going to go

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.990 
piston like I said I'm not going to go
into<00:03:42.349> great<00:03:42.650> detail<00:03:42.680> showing<00:03:43.340> what<00:03:43.549> all<00:03:43.760> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
into great detail showing what all the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.520 
into great detail showing what all the
Pistons<00:03:44.359> can<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:44.840> there<00:03:45.079> you<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.410> go

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
Pistons can do because there you can go

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.000 
Pistons can do because there you can go
check<00:03:45.709> out<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.859> tutorial<00:03:46.989> but<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.739> say

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
check out the tutorial but I can say

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.039 
check out the tutorial but I can say
that<00:03:49.040> pistons<00:03:49.699> were<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.910> big<00:03:50.209> game<00:03:50.480> changer<00:03:50.930> and

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
that pistons were a big game changer and

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.569 
that pistons were a big game changer and
how<00:03:51.109> minecraft<00:03:51.709> was<00:03:51.919> actually<00:03:52.280> played

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
how minecraft was actually played

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.030 
how minecraft was actually played
because<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.599> allows<00:03:53.840> for<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:54.199> movable<00:03:54.799> world

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
because it allows for a movable world

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.849 
because it allows for a movable world
basically<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.750> one<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.169> something<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
basically that one is something that I

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.289 
basically that one is something that I
am<00:03:58.220> quite<00:03:58.609> excited<00:03:58.760> about<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.669> they've

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
am quite excited about that and they've

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.379 
am quite excited about that and they've
also<00:04:02.449> made<00:04:02.629> it<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.199> that<00:04:03.639> redstone<00:04:04.639> links<00:04:05.209> up

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
also made it so that redstone links up

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.569 
also made it so that redstone links up
with<00:04:05.419> these<00:04:05.750> repeaters<00:04:06.169> now<00:04:06.500> prior<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.340> when

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
with these repeaters now prior to when

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.069 
with these repeaters now prior to when
you<00:04:07.699> decreed<00:04:08.120> these<00:04:08.329> little<00:04:08.569> repeaters

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
you decreed these little repeaters

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.319 
you decreed these little repeaters
redstone<00:04:10.040> just<00:04:10.310> would<00:04:10.489> not<00:04:10.639> work<00:04:10.940> with<00:04:11.180> it

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
redstone just would not work with it

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.569 
redstone just would not work with it
quite<00:04:11.599> right<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:12.199> if<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.190> try<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.370> do

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
quite right and if you try to do

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.580 
quite right and if you try to do
something<00:04:13.760> like<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.030> pulsar<00:04:14.599> or<00:04:14.810> repeater<00:04:15.349> or

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
something like a pulsar or repeater or

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.050 
something like a pulsar or repeater or
something<00:04:15.889> like<00:04:15.949> that<00:04:16.010> redstone<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.880> would

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
something like that redstone just would

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.629 
something like that redstone just would
not<00:04:17.209> work<00:04:17.479> well<00:04:18.470> with<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.889> update<00:04:19.099> they<00:04:19.430> did

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
not work well with this update they did

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.089 
not work well with this update they did
so<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.479> couple<00:04:21.409> of<00:04:21.560> other<00:04:21.739> noteworthy

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
so a couple of other noteworthy

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.969 
so a couple of other noteworthy

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
additions is stackable fences TNT now

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.550 
additions is stackable fences TNT now

they've improved the save system so it

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800 
they've improved the save system so it
