00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello, for a start, remember my 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.069
 video about the main elements of nodes for 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.620
 beginners if with welding evil running 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.440
 the tip is shaped towards the future 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 working loop after disassembling us into what 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 get a Cossack I'm here just 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.480
 everything and that is now we rubbed 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 Eastern knot and get Cossack 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 nodule Cossack knot when than it took as 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.450
 gazebo founded shkotovo near the village 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.450
 an hour the most interesting if the Cossack knot 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.320
 do with a loop for a breeze fast 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 reset or in a folk with a bow with us 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.780
 it turns out Kalmyk knot here it is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 the famous Kalmyk knot is the same 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.100
 Cossack but with a bow of Yakutia this node 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.530
 can be called Yakutsk muzlom 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.829
 Now let's look at the principle of mating 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 Kalmyk evil 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 do with slag is inserted into it 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 running tip inside this shlag 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 classes inside this schlag completely 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.729
 then 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 the slag of its upper part is illuminated 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:18.750
 the left side pounce on the right and in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.530
 the former right happy runs 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.530
 Coil tip proper eyelet 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 Kalmyk knot ready 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 the sailors knit certainly no other way 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.130
 leg in the league rub rub up short 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.259
 running tip short noticed 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.150
 just rub the slag on hand on 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.899
 we get a running kidney same inside 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.380
 shmara then back of your hand and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.329
 left pulls out what we need 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 here here just here and offset this 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.770
 happens simultaneously then 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.189
 picked up by the running tip loop and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.590
 throw a bundle ready and now I 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.270
 I will show a huge lack of Kalmyk 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.940
 of evil 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.000
 which are just 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.960
 you need to know are starting to knit we 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.310
 sea ​​call mouse knot right here 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.400
 we shift we prepare to accept the undercarriage 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 tip and too intense with your left hand 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.920
 We pull out this loop at the same time on 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.260
 Karina tips we form our personal 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.390
 node in this case we do not need 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.930
 it's completely dangerous because the knot 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.660
 it turns out absolutely no adhesive 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 nodule he is from this after mating is not 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.210
 should form a style formed 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.040
 you should deploy it now i will show 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.040
 how to deal with it 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.540
 But if you know what there is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.460
 lack of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.310
 cowboy evil land easy to handle 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.010
 just look after you carefully 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.510
 steel pulling out you have your 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.430
 honest zilog you just finger 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:15.860
 return back there so once and all 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.190
 you can delay but if you have 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.510
 welding knot turned out get ready for 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:28.239
 flying not in a dream she will find you on 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.540
 earth what's a bundle 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.380
 In general, as I said, Kalmyk is easier 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.870
 knit with a short running tip but not 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.820
 it always happens that way 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.489
 easy and tie in with short but not always 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.400
 it happens sometimes running tip you 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.560
 it turns out pretty long and in this 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.380
 case you have a tip not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.270
 It turns out inside of this schlag course 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.100
 it's easy to put it in there and 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:01.459
 continue to knit Kalmyk but if you don’t 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.489
 will throw as you have a 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.590
 and then all the same as if you knit 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.290
 call back and you will get Scythians 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.510
 nodule here just skills your knot not 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.000
 where he is not described anything he is obtained 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.720
 such thoughts are not correct to knit her 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.019
 Kalmyk give release it soon Losik 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.240
 without a bow can not work without 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.240
 she is generally weak in a bow and we look and 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.770
 its structure i.e. basic hitch 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.290
 basic hitch 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.560
 not our code and node based it faster 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.630
 based on a direct node although this is also not 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.030
 quite correct but the same theory in it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.979
 I will not go without this little bow 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.979
 fail immediately look 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.729
 pulled he failed 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.280
 repetition is the mother of learning if you 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.990
 short running tip we whom we 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.879
 bind without problems the most important thing 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.470
 whatever the choke 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.780
 and an arrow with long she is my tip that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.800
 very often it arises here 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.750
 little such an inconvenience if Kalmyks 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.300
 and knit we mean we need to throw 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.150
 so that the step is choral tip 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.930
 then everything is so easy and just continue 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.330
 colnago but if we don't throw over 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.539
 we will have a facetted bail very 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.870
 conveniently by the way in mating very comfortable yes and 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.250
 here you don't need to know this 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.030
 some advise how to fold 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.909
 loop and loop and insert is not necessary 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.800
 why immediately grab and we are for melancholy 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.990
 sailors in general they drag 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.379
 pulled out and sweeping knits always 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.120
 The knot of the knot is beautiful and very 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.849
 convenient for auxiliary work 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.759
 fine knot i always use it on 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.949
 mooring yes but even on wide supports 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.729
 he can even with a bow with this right 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:57.029
 faces and so somehow this 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.069
 can neutralize this boy 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.699
 double increase then it will 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:04.680
 stronger 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:07.710
 that is, we fold this running tip 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.889
 do as it were and doubled tip 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.680
 and already knit this choir doubled 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.050
 the bow at us will increase two times in 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.240
 In this case, all year we have a leg 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.960
 much stronger well, probably write everything 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.610
 komenty 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.610
 goodbye everything is clear for now
