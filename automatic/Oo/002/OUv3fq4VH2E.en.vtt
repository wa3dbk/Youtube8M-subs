00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
muffler out put this piece of pipe in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.220 
muffler out put this piece of pipe in
here<00:00:44.239> or<00:00:47.270> what<00:00:48.270> I'll<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> get

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
here or what I'll do actually I can get

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
here or what I'll do actually I can get
a<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.890> there's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> half<00:00:50.760> inch

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a think there's a two and a half inch

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
a think there's a two and a half inch
turned<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:52.219> that<00:00:53.329> comes<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> goes

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
turned down that comes this way and goes

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
turned down that comes this way and goes
like<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.539> here<00:00:57.539> I'll<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:59.780> yeah

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
like that if I can here I'll do yeah

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
like that if I can here I'll do yeah
I'll<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.960> skip<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> two-and-a-half<00:01:02.090> fit<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I'll just skip the two-and-a-half fit it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.640 
I'll just skip the two-and-a-half fit it
over<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> still<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.439> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
over that I think I can still get that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.060 
over that I think I can still get that
off<00:01:05.330> well<00:01:06.330> fine<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> didn't<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.920> actually

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
didn't get in very far so see if I can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.800 
didn't get in very far so see if I can
get<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.600> off

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
little bit cleaner what I'm gonna do is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.910 
little bit cleaner what I'm gonna do is
got<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.130> guy<00:01:45.340> out<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:46.320> he's<00:01:47.320> tucked<00:01:47.650> up<00:01:47.800> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
so I'm gonna turn down that's out a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.090 
so I'm gonna turn down that's out a
slight<00:01:51.220> angle<00:01:51.690> he's<00:01:52.690> gonna<00:01:52.840> come<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.830> way

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
slight angle he's gonna come this way

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.280 
slight angle he's gonna come this way
and<00:01:54.430> then<00:01:55.240> my<00:01:55.360> pipe<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.840> gonna<00:01:56.020> come<00:01:56.260> down

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and then my pipe is gonna come down

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
and then my pipe is gonna come down
right<00:01:56.650> here

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
right here

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.030 
right here
so<00:01:58.810> I'm<00:01:59.110> gonna<00:01:59.320> rest<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.650> what<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.830> thing

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.970 
so I'm gonna rest of what this thing
sounds<00:02:00.220> like<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.810> without<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.170> muffler<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
sounds like just without the muffler and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.740 
sounds like just without the muffler and
just<00:02:03.430> straight<00:02:03.700> pipe<00:02:04.650> I'm<00:02:05.650> thinking<00:02:06.160> it'll<00:02:06.310> be

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
just straight pipe I'm thinking it'll be

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.390 
just straight pipe I'm thinking it'll be
there<00:02:07.750> won't<00:02:07.900> be<00:02:07.960> any<00:02:08.110> drone<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:12.010> muffler

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
there won't be any drone that muffler

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:36.330 
there won't be any drone that muffler
kind<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.910> no
