00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.930 
architect toolbox the evaluation version
okay<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.289> first<00:00:12.529> functional<00:00:13.129> is<00:00:13.520> really

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
okay the first functional is really

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.450 
okay the first functional is really
meant<00:00:14.150> term<00:00:14.480> used<00:00:15.230> when<00:00:15.590> you're<00:00:15.949> designing<00:00:16.070> a

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
meant term used when you're designing a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.510 
meant term used when you're designing a
hard<00:00:16.640> surface<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:18.230> usually<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:18.710> guard<00:00:19.040> and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
hard surface the usually is guard and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.090 
hard surface the usually is guard and
half<00:00:19.790> a<00:00:19.910> hub<00:00:20.650> and<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.700> know<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:22.970> can<00:00:23.240> now

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
half a hub and and I know you can now

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.400 
half a hub and and I know you can now
modify<00:00:25.100> these<00:00:25.340> control<00:00:25.880> points<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.960> define

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
modify these control points to define

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.479 
modify these control points to define
the<00:00:27.590> shape<00:00:27.770> okay<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.970> we<00:00:31.970> want<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.270> know<00:00:33.489> what

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
the shape okay so we want to know what

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.819 
the shape okay so we want to know what
the<00:00:34.940> hydrostatic<00:00:35.390> properties<00:00:36.019> of<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.409> silver

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
the hydrostatic properties of is silver

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.840 
the hydrostatic properties of is silver
song<00:00:37.629> okay<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:38.899> just<00:00:38.929> click<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.559> tool

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
song okay so we just click on the tool

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.520 
song okay so we just click on the tool
in<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:40.999> case<00:00:41.329> we're<00:00:41.749> gonna<00:00:41.870> use<00:00:41.989> symmetry

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
in this case we're gonna use symmetry

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.630 
in this case we're gonna use symmetry
because<00:00:43.339> we<00:00:43.699> only<00:00:43.850> have<00:00:44.030> half<00:00:44.269> a<00:00:44.300> hole<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.640> we

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
because we only have half a hole and we

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.079 
because we only have half a hole and we
would<00:00:46.850> love<00:00:46.999> to<00:00:47.210> like<00:00:47.389> to<00:00:47.600> draw<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.289> graph<00:00:49.089> so

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
would love to like to draw a graph so

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.149 
would love to like to draw a graph so
now<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.019> can<00:00:51.229> specify<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.829> number<00:00:52.010> of

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
now we can specify the number of

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.539 
now we can specify the number of
sections<00:00:53.139> and<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:55.280> more<00:00:55.460> sections<00:00:55.960> we<00:00:56.960> use

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
sections and the more sections we use

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.479 
sections and the more sections we use
the<00:00:58.549> more<00:00:58.729> accurate<00:00:59.089> the<00:00:59.120> results<00:00:59.329> will<00:01:00.109> be<00:01:00.489> so

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the more accurate the results will be so

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.060 
the more accurate the results will be so
it's<00:01:02.209> 50<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:05.780> are<00:01:05.930> specifying<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's 50 and then you are specifying the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.380 
it's 50 and then you are specifying the
hard<00:01:07.310> surface<00:01:09.009> okay<00:01:10.009> that's<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:13.329> here<00:01:14.329> you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
hard surface okay that's it so here you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.609 
hard surface okay that's it so here you
can<00:01:14.570> see<00:01:14.719> all<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.930> results<00:01:17.409> displaced<00:01:18.409> volume

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
can see all the results displaced volume

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.170 
can see all the results displaced volume
of<00:01:19.149> 6.5<00:01:20.149> cubic<00:01:20.960> meters<00:01:21.729> when<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:22.850> surface

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
of 6.5 cubic meters when it's surface

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.249 
of 6.5 cubic meters when it's surface

moment<00:01:27.289> 0<00:01:28.070> obviously<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:31.299> yes<00:01:32.299> let's<00:01:32.600> let<00:01:33.170> our

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
moment 0 obviously and yes let's let our

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.630 
moment 0 obviously and yes let's let our
calculated<00:01:34.009> values<00:01:35.109> and<00:01:36.640> additionally

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
calculated values and additionally

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.510 
calculated values and additionally
because<00:01:37.820> we<00:01:38.149> asked<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.630> draw<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> graph<00:01:39.340> we<00:01:40.340> have

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
because we asked to draw a graph we have

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.919 
because we asked to draw a graph we have
a<00:01:41.590> section<00:01:42.590> here<00:01:42.890> on<00:01:43.549> let<00:01:44.390> me<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:44.659> show<00:01:44.869> you

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
a section here on let me just show you

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.319 
a section here on let me just show you
the<00:01:45.170> electrode<00:01:45.649> which<00:01:46.219> is<00:01:46.249> the<00:01:46.609> hull<00:01:46.850> balance

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
the electrode which is the hull balance

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.889 
the electrode which is the hull balance
tool<00:01:49.329> so<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.920> case<00:01:52.219> we<00:01:52.939> want<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.179> know<00:01:53.270> all

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
tool so in this case we want to know all

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.779 
tool so in this case we want to know all
the<00:01:54.140> half<00:01:54.350> loads<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.960> when<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.159> center<00:01:58.729> of

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
the half loads and when the center of

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.349 
the half loads and when the center of
gravity<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.329> moved<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> different<00:01:59.929> location

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
gravity is moved to a different location

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.480 
gravity is moved to a different location
so<00:02:02.359> let's<00:02:02.960> do<00:02:03.439> that<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:06.069> we<00:02:07.069> are<00:02:07.130> using<00:02:07.340> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so let's do that so we are using a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.760 
so let's do that so we are using a
symmetry<00:02:07.850> again<00:02:08.179> let's<00:02:09.110> turn<00:02:09.350> on<00:02:09.470> our<00:02:09.590> can

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
symmetry again let's turn on our can

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.520 
symmetry again let's turn on our can
I'll<00:02:09.890> draw<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> graph<00:02:10.870> let's<00:02:11.870> grant<00:02:12.110> stick<00:02:12.380> with

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
I'll draw a graph let's grant stick with

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.120 
I'll draw a graph let's grant stick with
20<00:02:12.920> seconds<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.050> specify<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
20 seconds we have to specify the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.320 
20 seconds we have to specify the
-<00:02:16.400> splat<00:02:16.700> formula<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:22.430> five<00:02:22.640> cubic<00:02:23.000> meters

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
- splat formula for five cubic meters

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.510 
- splat formula for five cubic meters
and<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:25.520> center<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.820> gravity<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
and the center of gravity so this is the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.700 
and the center of gravity so this is the
regular<00:02:28.700> kind<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.450> gravity<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:29.990> this<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.290> one

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
regular kind of gravity in this is one

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.580 
regular kind of gravity in this is one
that's<00:02:30.890> good<00:02:31.340> off<00:02:31.540> -<00:02:32.540> let's<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:34.330> then

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that's good off - let's do that one then

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.390 
that's good off - let's do that one then
the<00:02:36.590> outside<00:02:38.920> okay

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the outside okay

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.150 
the outside okay
what<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.820> see<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:41.240> is<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.830> hull

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
what you can see now is that the hull

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.670 
what you can see now is that the hull
float<00:02:47.030> smells<00:02:47.390> heavy<00:02:47.660> because<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.320> use<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
float smells heavy because we use the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.510 
float smells heavy because we use the
fluid<00:02:48.980> center<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.370> gravity<00:02:51.190> melians<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
fluid center of gravity melians for the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.480 
fluid center of gravity melians for the
hull<00:02:52.670> balance<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.270> his<00:02:53.630> charm<00:02:54.190> calculate<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
hull balance to his charm calculate the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.560 
hull balance to his charm calculate the
writing<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.170> gear<00:02:57.410> hub<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.330> case

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
writing on of the gear hub in this case

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.160 
writing on of the gear hub in this case
we<00:02:59.810> have<00:03:00.020> or<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.620> will<00:03:00.800> concede<00:03:01.160> 420<00:03:01.730> degrees

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
we have or I will concede 420 degrees

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.910

you<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.380> see<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.790> floats<00:03:05.180> incorrectly<00:03:06.400> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
you can see it floats incorrectly and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700 
you can see it floats incorrectly and
use<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.100> torch<00:03:10.400> or<00:03:10.760> balancer<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.710> calculate

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
use the torch or balancer and calculate

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.580 
use the torch or balancer and calculate
all<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:12.920> them<00:03:13.160> are<00:03:14.090> aesthetics<00:03:14.720> including

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
all of them are aesthetics including

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.750 
all of them are aesthetics including
writing<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:17.270> case<00:03:17.570> luckily<00:03:18.290> no<00:03:18.560> symmetry

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:42.270 

sections<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:24.350> one<00:03:28.570> gravity<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:33.490> surface

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.700 

okay<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.350> now<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.650> put<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.190> balance<00:03:46.370> tub<00:03:47.710> we've

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
okay so now we put the balance tub we've

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.490 
okay so now we put the balance tub we've
got<00:03:48.920> all<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.220> hydro<00:03:49.550> statics<00:03:50.410> including<00:03:51.410> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
got all the hydro statics including the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.240 
got all the hydro statics including the
righting<00:03:51.830> moment<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.830> end<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.100> the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
righting moment this is the end of the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.850 
righting moment this is the end of the
demo<00:03:55.460> I<00:03:55.760> hope<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.870> fermented<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.560> picked
