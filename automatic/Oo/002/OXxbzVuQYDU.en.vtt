00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 we also see another international julien malzieu alongside 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 stéphane etcheverry it was the big game today on channel victory of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.980
 Clermont who found the smile your wife for the season's valves 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.959
 Difficult conditions 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.570
 yes absolutely company 2 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.039
 of julien malzieu already first question added that he will not join 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.460
 marcoussis tomorrow night how do you find 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.789
 yeah that's fine 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.699
 we have not been very good since over two more home games in 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 car race the behaviors last week 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.359
 So we really did not have 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.660
 wade to catch up and vis-à-vis us roll that vis-à-vis the e of the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.260
 public at the site and these shoes cost in euros I'll be able to pass it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.899
 this week to spoof really mind free hours and really think 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.590
 because the quality of French offering the best works of the actions of the 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.250
 best moments highlights of seven encounters 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.400
 trade wind cornet despite the conditions of play 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.140
 to complicate it a little loathsome has a lot safer 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.690
 on clermont throughout this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.690
 day and the team of Clermont Ferrand 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 this election 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.200
 it was perfectly free 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.810
 if the first try of the encounter for goudiaby stone if this goal 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.890
 the attacked so far 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.660
 transparency especially useful 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.220
 the objectives of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 our elected officials all the little details that tell them that yesterday 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 had hurt us during the last two rock meets 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.300
 regards his beautiful vampire 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.620
 Too many balloons all that is needed for me in every nook and cranny 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.090
 secrets 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.470
 we had to build 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.920
 all the jostling of the elbow 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.570
 from the stone shot there were no clean balloons for them 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.760
 today she really did not have two 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.850
 to make the effort on it and I think we have really made a big 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.340
 effort on it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 we had good times played behind we helped with cleaning 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.110
 a lot of parents who kill right away from nothing 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 and on the left and in the opposite direction 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.870
 following his team it is very true that it was refused with the arbitrator 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.100
 or else on clermont 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.620
 what does it do to its population the day a few weeks later 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.619
 Sunday some certainties 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.050
 with the look of the marks dester save this situation we extract urgently 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.429
 but the pub before the little foot game that may not have been interesting at least 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.970
 because caster and Parisians who being a little bit afraid of that of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 Europe of their level to whom it will be necessary in Corsican 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.720
 we can recover for the following weeks to ensure that quebec has succeeded 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.399
 both face it's true but the Parisians do not miss 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.389
 it was done 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.519
 concert at the grand prize of Budapest 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.209
 in passing we note that benoît baby is fit and in good shape it's 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.910
 auspicious 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.030
 before France-Argentina and Parisians have tried things 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.599
 but 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.190
 they were countered by this is the action the selection julien tilkens to 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.809
 side of you because florence 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.769
 I picked it up alas 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.400
 disaster the contestants told two stages 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.669
 these accesses to the canvas or just a year before and more so 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.159
 the regular does not see so I know to continue 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.339
 I hit hard in the ball 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.699
 of luck the ball stays right 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.389
 I say I was lucky of times I said the third time I think that 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.039
 It's okay 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.959
 it's not going to do it and then maybe today continues to type better 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.039
 and then I go it's the pick up the ball was really very very slippery and 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.939
 of the couple 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.299
 his wife Sharon shook 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.749
 the main thing was the victory was there 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.799
 the game found the smile in the locker room is really there 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 the essential thing was that we find ourselves forced to pleasure and 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.709
 especially since we find the way of life so much because it is a bit of a 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.609
 little weight in this defeat 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.569
 at home euro was really looking forward to catch up with its spectator shows and 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.509
 the score is heavy for paris who do not leave with anything at all with them 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.919
 hero points no defensive bonus points for the Parisians 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.780
 what happened this week here in Clermont it was really hard 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.400
 we were told to us journalists that his view was still a 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.409
 nacelle reframing 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.419
 you want a finger so the return of anthony but it reminded me of the ol 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.879
 then leads when we lose against home castres 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.030
 or the neck the look or the pig in order to test the mode physically and% 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.799
 and mentally I'm con and prelates 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.180
 hobbies go together in the in the difficulty of the blow he put us in 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.039
 artwork 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.879
 he turned on and the friends 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.680
 not really in difficult conditions to see its independence 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.420
 all welded the loan to communicate all together a personal essay I 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.259
 think that 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.039
 percent day and week start in europe 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.989
 we all have all responded present in was really supportive all its meaning 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.849
 in the in the difficulty 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.639
 and I think that's really what made our the trofense 2% and 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.089
 tomorrow tonight and it materialized and of which 15 had managed perfectly the 

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:28.610
 strategy that we're tactically up this game that belonged to you I 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.509
 tell kader weather conditions a little complicated really 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.469
 this is the match that had to be done also for the one to reassure 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:35.999
 qualities of heart fighting qualities 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:37.699
 for them for sure we will see it 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.900
 roger shearer dolphin month 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.900
 a correct match it says in quotation marks% I think it's however 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.349
 elsewhere the new ones 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.300
 in all the roles we kept all our balloons 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.919
 we were present in combat have responded present in the fight we have 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.300
 advanced in 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.800
 in all that was piped word 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.729
 In fact, we felt that it was a bit difficult to find these 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.380
 blow time and pierre mignoni had the nose almost all his own balloons 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.840
 so easy I was green and then it's a lot easier for 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.639
 we 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.229
 when we have balloons too close 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.229
 law i think it's really there taking all happy and happy 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.279
 i hope will be tess going through stopping in in two weeks 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.969
 in the program of games and hobbies where I hope it's going that dares while 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.430
 Keeping going, the suitcase is ready 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.340
 all are not yet 20 years old she continues we're still here I'm going 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.759
 prepare for his fans do you go and let's go a little bit more 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.120
 late in the evening then after years 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.749
 in this novel the team of France 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.599
 that's it and thank you so much money just been with us it's 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.800
