it<00:01:23.100> occurred<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.520> earlier<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it occurred to me earlier on that I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
it occurred to me earlier on that I

grosgrain<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.810> occurred<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
grosgrain and it occurred to me that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
grosgrain and it occurred to me that
there<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.950> seam<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:30.000> that

there is this seam up the back that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
there is this seam up the back that
wouldn't<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.320> nice<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.890> seam<00:01:32.159> could<00:01:32.399> be

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
wouldn't be nice if that seam could be

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
wouldn't be nice if that seam could be
covered<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.060> grosgrain<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.899> we<00:01:34.170> settled
