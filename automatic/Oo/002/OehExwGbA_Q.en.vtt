00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
summer tire and then they just took the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.770

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
back and put them on a used car they had

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
back and put them on a used car they had
that<00:01:11.040> needed<00:01:11.310> tires<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:14.240> they

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that needed tires so I got these they

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
that needed tires so I got these they
were<00:01:15.360> cheaper<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.140> other

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
were cheaper than my other one other

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
were cheaper than my other one other
tires<00:01:17.159> they're<00:01:17.490> only<00:01:17.840> $750<00:01:18.840> versus<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
tires they're only $750 versus like a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.539 
tires they're only $750 versus like a
thousand<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.290> those<00:01:22.740> helped<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
thousand so those those helped a bit I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
thousand so those those helped a bit I
think<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> probably

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
think what I'm going to do is probably

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.310 
think what I'm going to do is probably
get<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.130> rear<00:01:26.460> sway<00:01:26.759> bar<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.990> two-wheel

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
get a rear sway bar from a two-wheel

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.550 
get a rear sway bar from a two-wheel
drive<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:29.369> supposedly<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.560> helps

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
drive because supposedly that helps

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
drive because supposedly that helps
quite<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.189> omni's<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.270> reading<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
quite a bit omni's I was reading the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
quite a bit omni's I was reading the
rear<00:01:34.110> sway<00:01:34.350> bar<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> all-wheel<00:01:35.100> drive<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
rear sway bar on the all-wheel drive is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.499 
rear sway bar on the all-wheel drive is
significantly<00:01:37.670> thinner<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> two-wheel

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
significantly thinner than the two-wheel

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.109 
significantly thinner than the two-wheel
drives<00:01:39.920> not<00:01:40.920> even<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> Sport<00:01:41.759> Package

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

rear<00:01:42.299> sway<00:01:42.479> bar<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> regular

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

rear sway bar like the just a regular
two-wheel<00:01:44.549> drive<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.689> supposedly

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
two-wheel drive and now supposedly

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.370 
two-wheel drive and now supposedly
because<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.890> did<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:48.380> they

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
because they did that is because they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.830 
because they did that is because they
wanted<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.829> car<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> an

wanted this car to have more of an

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
wanted this car to have more of an
understandin<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> winter<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.979> most

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
understandin see in the winter for most

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.499 
understandin see in the winter for most
of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> people<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.670> buy<00:01:53.880> these<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:54.149> they

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
of the people that buy these things they

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.510 
of the people that buy these things they
don't<00:01:54.600> grab<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.280> wanted

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
don't grab them like I do so they wanted

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.289 
don't grab them like I do so they wanted
to<00:01:56.579> understeer<00:01:57.299> rather<00:01:57.570> than<00:01:59.299> oversteer

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
to understeer rather than oversteer

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
to understeer rather than oversteer
because<00:02:00.659> most<00:02:00.990> people<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.469> afraid<00:02:01.680> when

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
because most people get afraid when

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.260 
because most people get afraid when
oversteer<00:02:02.490> happens<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.149> why

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
oversteer happens and that's why

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.730 
oversteer happens and that's why
everybody<00:02:03.420> buys<00:02:03.689> front-wheel<00:02:04.200> drive<00:02:04.259> cars

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
everybody buys front-wheel drive cars

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and they're afraid of rear-wheel drive

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.839 
and they're afraid of rear-wheel drive
they<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.619> how<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> drive<00:02:08.009> they'll<00:02:08.700> be

so<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> try<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so I think I'm going to try that and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
so I think I'm going to try that and
then<00:02:12.090> supposedly<00:02:12.480> that'll<00:02:12.780> help<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> car

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
then supposedly that'll help the car

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.160 
then supposedly that'll help the car
handle<00:02:13.650> better<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:15.510> will<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:18.390> more<00:02:18.570> oversteer

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
handle better it will do more oversteer

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.890 
handle better it will do more oversteer
e-type<00:02:20.060> driving<00:02:21.060> which<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.480> way<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.690> car

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
e-type driving which is the way this car

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
e-type driving which is the way this car
should<00:02:22.050> feel<00:02:22.320> since<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.310> rear-wheel<00:02:23.520> drive

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
should feel since it's rear-wheel drive

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.270 
should feel since it's rear-wheel drive
base<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:25.350> other<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.710> did<00:02:25.770> was<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.160> got

base the other thing I did was I got

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
don't know how I feel about him but I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.950 
don't know how I feel about him but I
wasn't<00:02:29.640> about<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.910> have<00:02:30.090> another<00:02:30.150> Jew<00:02:30.660> plate

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
wasn't about to have another Jew plate

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.860 
wasn't about to have another Jew plate
sedan<00:02:31.970> since<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.420> my<00:02:33.540> other<00:02:33.600> car

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
sedan since that was what my other car

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750 
sedan since that was what my other car
had<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.320> changed<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.100> don't<00:02:35.490> know<00:02:35.580> it's

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
was incredibly consistent I was shooting

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.510 
was incredibly consistent I was shooting
for<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.720> thirteen<00:04:45.229> point<00:04:45.560> nine<00:04:45.620> second<00:04:46.280> quarter

mile<00:04:46.669> couldn't<00:04:47.600> quite<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.050> best<00:04:48.470> like<00:04:48.620> I

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
mile couldn't quite do it best like I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.800 
mile couldn't quite do it best like I
was<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.889> 14-1<00:04:49.490> worst<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:49.970> was<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.210> fourteen<00:04:50.600> five
