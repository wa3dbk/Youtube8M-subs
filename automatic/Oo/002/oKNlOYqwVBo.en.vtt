sandy area and it's very hard to grow

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.089 
sandy area and it's very hard to grow
the<00:00:25.310> wasabi<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.779> why<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.080> real<00:00:28.470> wasabi

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the wasabi so that's why the real wasabi

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.510 
the wasabi so that's why the real wasabi
root<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.670> very<00:00:29.970> expensive<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.590> once<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.279> have

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
root is very expensive but once you have

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.900 
root is very expensive but once you have
it<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.149> taste<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:35.340> better

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it and you taste it it's so much better

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.260 
it and you taste it it's so much better
than<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.570> rossabi<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.620> fake<00:00:37.890> wasabi<00:00:38.270> such

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
than other rossabi that fake wasabi such

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.290 
than other rossabi that fake wasabi such
as<00:00:39.540> -<00:00:40.050> wasabi<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.890> powder<00:00:41.219> wasabi<00:00:41.820> those<00:00:42.090> are

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
as - wasabi or powder wasabi those are

put the colors in it and that's the fake

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.410 
put the colors in it and that's the fake
wasabi<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> fresh<00:00:52.140> wasabi<00:00:52.649> root

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
wasabi so this is the fresh wasabi root

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
wasabi so this is the fresh wasabi root
this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.870> short<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.440> sometimes<00:00:55.890> comes

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this is very short but sometimes comes

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
this is very short but sometimes comes
like<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.090> sometimes<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.870> bigger<00:00:58.230> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
like this and sometimes more bigger like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
like this and sometimes more bigger like
a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:59.160> thicker<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> stems

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
a little thicker and this is the stems

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
a little thicker and this is the stems
and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.800> leaf<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.190> course<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.180> eat<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and the little leaf of course we eat the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.160 
and the little leaf of course we eat the
root<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.229> also<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> stems<00:01:05.630> stem<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
root and also the stems stem so you can

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530 
root and also the stems stem so you can
cut<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.950> pieces<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:09.119> marinate

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
cut it in little pieces you can marinate

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
cut it in little pieces you can marinate
in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> soy<00:01:09.990> sauce<00:01:10.049> or<00:01:10.619> any<00:01:11.189> other<00:01:11.400> things<00:01:11.790> and
