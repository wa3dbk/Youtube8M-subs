00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.620
 I asked myself something very daring 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.600
 that meant not withheld 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.419
 who does not know the following video from the FMA oku 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.419
 known as the logo LP

 If you had that she was off once in a while this summer we have and listen 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:29.989
 Nadal has been told that we do not 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.249
 Well 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.519
 that, in turn, has been shown by this find I have been there again and again 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.430
 asked 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.390
 is that really the reality is it is right 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 the track fits so well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.970
 everything and finally today I did not do anything 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.740
 tried 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.790
 imitated 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.490
 Of course that is you now 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.760
 Microsoft's app trials and Cacau Washke 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.030
 May the alcohol, I'm not so sure about finger I do not know so 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.020
 exactly 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.970
 would 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 Werder always has to be seen 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.289

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.520
 Weapon finds a bit but the big whole country is what is actually 4 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 then, of course, sugar 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 4 to 3 1 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 Although similar 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 Kabul 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.599
 I mean so much because otherwise it is also in the East and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.459
 sparkled country receives 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.539
 So I try it 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.909
 because one does not express the Lehmann 2 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.619
 Of course, even more 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.399
 Nemeth 4 4 tablespoons of flour 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.399

 Christ one-handed 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.139
 2 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
 almost clean 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.359
 a so 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.899
 that is, Roman Marti Tanzes is enough for Klein 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.669
 he fooled me 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.589
 we have 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.039
 I'd just go see the other third of Founder Essener's customer 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.299
 to listen to 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.919
 but they know nothing 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.919
 was a purely must he help me one more 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.049
 Blood of ours is unknown APA here with a charge there not so good 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.069
 more so on the net we will catch up with her fiancé 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
 and then, hopefully, I've got behind me "and" Mea Culpa. " 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.989
 and that a product looks like this leaves or 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.879
 for the foals 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 you can even taste pain like 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.699
 wonderful with products like that and then of course how that has done in the 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.999
 Microwave the whole 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 if I do not always win where 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.659
 National coach now common 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.409
 not to have to 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.919
 there are always way three minutes planks 57 clock sounds 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.649
 with video 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.269
 pte pte pte pte pte 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.169
 finally play 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.969
 it is really round 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.279
 pure coincidence 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.609
 That was right 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.609
 there is no big one 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 but is that couple 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.799
 Peter Mücke in the kitchen 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 so flooded by Le Mans 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.669
 and so had to for the forecast 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.430
 now comes the most important 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.479
 the taste test 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.800
 that's kind of funny from Warburg 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.219
 I'll try it 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.740
 name is 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.969
 there tastes 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.150
 Kulig 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.970
 "It just crap out but seems really good 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.129
 does not illustrate and my god he was right 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.849
 that's why we kick 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.039
 never existed 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.490
 this is Olympia 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.710
 Drummond one think 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.090
 to the world premiere 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.590
 At this point I just want to say Ochoa of course you can go back to that 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.409
 watch 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.959
 and it tastes very good it is funny but you can really 

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.999
 best and it tastes good 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.159
 I recommend it here in Dülmen. "That's so cool 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.699
 before debts had been almost rewarded, the debt would now have to clarify
