forward is the car and then we really
made<00:01:03.350> significant<00:01:03.949> gains<00:01:04.010> there<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.150> AI<00:01:05.300> is

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
made significant gains there the AI is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.700 
made significant gains there the AI is
now<00:01:05.690> much<00:01:05.930> more<00:01:06.110> capable<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.590> making

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
now much more capable of making
