00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.780 

next<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.629> take<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.109> Mark<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.560> point

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
next I'm going to take and Mark a point

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.839 
next I'm going to take and Mark a point
7/8<00:00:08.790> inch<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.450> from<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> base<00:00:11.809> and<00:00:13.519> this<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
7/8 inch up from the base and this is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.540 
7/8 inch up from the base and this is
going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.780> thickest<00:00:16.230> part<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
going to be the thickest part or the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.269 
going to be the thickest part or the
widest<00:00:18.000> part<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.720> ball<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.800> everything

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
widest part of the ball so everything

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
widest part of the ball so everything
from<00:00:20.520> there<00:00:20.910> down<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:21.990> rounded

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
from there down is going to be rounded

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
from there down is going to be rounded
over<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:23.039> there<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> be

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
over from there up it's going to be

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.750 
over from there up it's going to be
rounded<00:00:24.750> over<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:26.550> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
rounded over now I want to go around on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.070 
rounded over now I want to go around on
each<00:00:26.970> side<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.689> locate<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.619> line<00:00:30.019> now<00:00:31.019> we

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
each side and locate that line now we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.810 
each side and locate that line now we
should<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> point<00:00:32.250> where<00:00:32.430> we've<00:00:32.700> got

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
should be at this point where we've got

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
should be at this point where we've got
a<00:00:32.850> line<00:00:33.149> drawn<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a line drawn which is going to be the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.400 
a line drawn which is going to be the
thickest<00:00:34.829> part<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.399> ball<00:00:36.170> it's<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
thickest part of that ball it's so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.840 
thickest part of that ball it's so
important<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> keep<00:00:38.070> each<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> these

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
important to keep each one of these

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
important to keep each one of these
steps<00:00:39.180> consistent<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> accurate<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.460> finish

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
steps consistent and accurate and finish

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
steps consistent and accurate and finish
each<00:00:42.149> step<00:00:42.829> completely<00:00:43.829> before<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
each step completely before you go on to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.380 
each step completely before you go on to
the<00:00:44.700> next<00:00:44.910> one

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the next one

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
the next one
it<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.350> keeps<00:00:46.500> everything<00:00:46.789> nice<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.149> even

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it just keeps everything nice and even

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
it just keeps everything nice and even
and<00:00:48.989> consistent<00:00:52.879> next<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> focus

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and consistent next I'm going to focus

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
and consistent next I'm going to focus
on<00:00:54.860> rounding<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.430> lower<00:00:56.820> part<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.890> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
on rounding this lower part down to this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
on rounding this lower part down to this
line<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.460> drew<00:00:59.670> previously<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:01.230> going

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
line that we drew previously I'm going

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
line that we drew previously I'm going
to<00:01:01.500> start<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> quarter<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.329> inch<00:01:03.420> away

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
to start about a quarter of an inch away

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
to start about a quarter of an inch away
from<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> line<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.430> gently

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
from that line and just start gently

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
from that line and just start gently
rounding<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.020> sure

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
rounding it down you want to make sure

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
rounding it down you want to make sure
that<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> keeps<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:11.189> continuous<00:01:11.970> gentle<00:01:12.869> curve

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that it keeps a continuous gentle curve

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.560 
that it keeps a continuous gentle curve
you<00:01:13.710> want<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.100> any<00:01:14.250> flat<00:01:14.549> spots

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.170 

I<00:01:22.960> could<00:01:23.960> get<00:01:24.140> away<00:01:24.260> with<00:01:24.590> using<00:01:24.820> probably<00:01:25.820> a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
I could get away with using probably a

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.140 
I could get away with using probably a
number<00:01:26.479> three<00:01:27.020> for<00:01:27.650> doing<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.040> also<00:01:28.310> but

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
number three for doing this also but

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.420 
number three for doing this also but
there's<00:01:29.540> more<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.590> tendency<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
there's more of a tendency for the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.399 
there's more of a tendency for the
number<00:01:31.790> three<00:01:32.120> which<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.720> almost<00:01:33.710> flat

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
number three which is almost flat

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.469 
number three which is almost flat
there's<00:01:36.409> more<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.740> tendency<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.119> dig

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there's more of a tendency for it to dig

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.290 
there's more of a tendency for it to dig
in<00:01:38.660> on<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.840> sides<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:40.460> even<00:01:40.790> though<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> flat

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
in on the sides so even though the flat

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.790 
in on the sides so even though the flat
tends<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.380> leave<00:01:43.240> some<00:01:44.240> facets<00:01:45.050> some<00:01:45.560> flat

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
tends to leave some facets some flat

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.490 
tends to leave some facets some flat
surfaces<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.520> real<00:01:47.330> small<00:01:47.600> flat<00:01:47.930> surfaces

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
surfaces just real small flat surfaces

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.320 
surfaces just real small flat surfaces
it's<00:01:49.460> still<00:01:49.729> probably<00:01:49.970> better<00:01:50.450> than<00:01:50.690> using<00:01:51.009> a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
it's still probably better than using a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.300 
it's still probably better than using a
slightly<00:01:53.330> curved<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.619> try<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
slightly curved one you can try it and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
slightly curved one you can try it and
some<00:01:56.240> brands<00:01:56.630> actually<00:01:57.100> have<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:59.000> number<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
some brands actually have the number of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.420 
some brands actually have the number of
threes<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.869> actually<00:02:00.259> flatter<00:02:00.649> than<00:02:01.220> other

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
threes is actually flatter than other

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.170 
threes is actually flatter than other
brands<00:02:01.910> so<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.960> may<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:04.580> may<00:02:04.610> have<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.940> gouge

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
brands so you may you may have a gouge

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:14.530 
brands so you may you may have a gouge
that<00:02:05.450> will<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.720> this<00:02:07.690> accurately<00:02:13.239> but<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.300> just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
that will do this accurately but I just

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.020 
that will do this accurately but I just
used<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.900> number<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.290> mostly

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.910 

okay<00:02:23.690> I'm<00:02:23.870> keeping<00:02:24.230> an<00:02:24.290> eye<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.530> where<00:02:24.770> this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
okay I'm keeping an eye on where this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.590 
okay I'm keeping an eye on where this
line<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.520> very<00:02:28.790> end<00:02:29.150> here

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
line is and just at the very end here

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.150 
line is and just at the very end here
I'm<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> go<00:02:30.020> all<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.320> way<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:31.130> that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
I'm going to go all the way down to that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'm going to go all the way down to that
line

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.720 

the<00:02:53.660> inside<00:02:54.200> line<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:55.040> I've<00:02:55.160> drawn<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the inside line that I've drawn on the

the inside line that I've drawn on the
bottom<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> foot<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.260> edge<00:02:57.530> right

bottom of the foot is this edge right

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.460 
bottom of the foot is this edge right
here<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.819> as<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.060> rolling<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.540> down<00:02:59.569> rolling<00:03:00.350> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
here so as I rolling it down rolling it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:09.130 
here so as I rolling it down rolling it
under<00:03:07.390> alright<00:03:08.390> now<00:03:08.570> there's<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.870> little

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
under alright now there's a little

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.080 
under alright now there's a little
there's<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.620> high<00:03:09.800> spot<00:03:10.160> there<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:10.880> want

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
there's a high spot there so I just want

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:36.140 
there's a high spot there so I just want
to<00:03:11.150> gradually<00:03:12.110> blend<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.980> in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.600 

now<00:03:36.750> notice<00:03:37.019> after<00:03:37.290> I've<00:03:37.560> done<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.860> lot<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> this

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
now notice after I've done a lot of this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.220 
now notice after I've done a lot of this
then<00:03:38.819> I'm<00:03:38.909> coming<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.269> little<00:03:39.390> bit<00:03:39.540> closer<00:03:39.870> to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
then I'm coming a little bit closer to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.649 
then I'm coming a little bit closer to
that<00:03:40.260> line<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.580> don't<00:03:41.790> leave<00:03:41.940> any<00:03:42.120> flat

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
that line so I don't leave any flat

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.280 
that line so I don't leave any flat
spots<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:43.379> it's<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.950> nice<00:03:44.129> gradual<00:03:45.290> curve

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
spots there it's a nice gradual curve

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.940 
spots there it's a nice gradual curve
down<00:03:49.970> all<00:03:50.970> right<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.950> rounded

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
down all right you can see this rounded

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.309 
down all right you can see this rounded
over<00:03:53.220> area<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.720> go<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.140> next

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
over area I'm going to go on to the next

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:13.430 
over area I'm going to go on to the next
side<00:03:58.530> I<00:04:10.790> start<00:04:11.790> by<00:04:11.910> going<00:04:12.090> all<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:13.049> way<00:04:13.079> down

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
side I start by going all the way down

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:23.719 
side I start by going all the way down
to<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.280> line<00:04:14.660> edit<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> edge<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:23.699> I

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
to that line edit the edge and then I

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.370 
to that line edit the edge and then I
take<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.240> section<00:04:24.720> here<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.199> little

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
take this section here that's a little

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.200 
take this section here that's a little
high<00:04:25.530> right<00:04:25.830> there<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:26.669> smooth<00:04:27.030> that

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
high right there and just smooth that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.650 
high right there and just smooth that
over<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.590> meets<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.130> as<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.030> actual<00:04:30.389> high

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
over so it meets this as the actual high

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:56.189 
over so it meets this as the actual high
spot

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.389 

all<00:04:57.199> right<00:04:57.379> now<00:04:57.559> we've<00:04:57.709> got<00:04:57.919> two<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.279> these

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:58.399 
all right now we've got two of these

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.579 
all right now we've got two of these
sides<00:04:58.929> finished<00:04:59.929> down<00:05:00.169> at<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.439> bottom

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:00.589 
sides finished down at the bottom

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.399 
sides finished down at the bottom
section<00:05:01.219> here<00:05:01.569> lining<00:05:02.569> up<00:05:02.659> with<00:05:02.839> this<00:05:02.989> line

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.249 

most<00:05:06.409> important<00:05:06.889> thing<00:05:07.039> to<00:05:07.189> look<00:05:07.339> at<00:05:07.549> is

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
most important thing to look at is

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.359 
most important thing to look at is
really<00:05:09.639> imagine<00:05:10.639> that<00:05:11.079> this<00:05:12.079> claw<00:05:12.829> or<00:05:13.219> this

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:13.369 
really imagine that this claw or this

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.489 
really imagine that this claw or this
Talon<00:05:13.849> is<00:05:14.029> not<00:05:14.329> there<00:05:14.719> and<00:05:14.989> you<00:05:15.169> want<00:05:15.319> to<00:05:15.379> make

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:15.499 
Talon is not there and you want to make

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.659 
Talon is not there and you want to make
a<00:05:15.529> nice<00:05:15.769> smooth<00:05:16.869> line<00:05:18.039> from<00:05:19.039> there<00:05:19.249> to<00:05:19.279> there

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
a nice smooth line from there to there

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.059 
a nice smooth line from there to there
so<00:05:19.939> that's<00:05:20.689> a<00:05:20.779> continuous<00:05:21.289> line<00:05:21.589> from<00:05:21.889> there

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
so that's a continuous line from there

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.069 
so that's a continuous line from there
to<00:05:22.219> there<00:05:22.309> so<00:05:22.549> just<00:05:22.699> imagine<00:05:23.509> that<00:05:23.569> that's<00:05:23.839> not

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:24.079 
to there so just imagine that that's not

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.839 
to there so just imagine that that's not
there<00:05:24.379> and<00:05:24.619> if<00:05:24.739> one<00:05:24.919> of<00:05:24.949> these<00:05:25.129> is<00:05:25.339> higher<00:05:25.549> than

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
there and if one of these is higher than

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.399 
there and if one of these is higher than
the<00:05:25.999> other<00:05:26.149> then<00:05:26.659> you<00:05:26.779> need<00:05:26.899> to<00:05:27.019> lower<00:05:27.169> that

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
the other then you need to lower that

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.799 
the other then you need to lower that
down<00:05:27.469> but<00:05:27.979> just<00:05:28.219> look<00:05:28.879> at<00:05:29.059> it<00:05:29.179> from<00:05:29.299> that<00:05:29.389> point

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:29.809 
down but just look at it from that point

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.609 
down but just look at it from that point
and<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.139> should<00:05:30.679> be<00:05:30.829> a<00:05:30.860> continuous<00:05:31.959> plane<00:05:32.959> or

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:33.619 
and that should be a continuous plane or

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.039 
and that should be a continuous plane or
a<00:05:33.649> continuous<00:05:34.219> line<00:05:34.569> going<00:05:35.569> from<00:05:35.779> there<00:05:35.929> to

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:36.049 
a continuous line going from there to

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:46.250 
a continuous line going from there to
there

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.570 

nobody<00:05:47.260> wants<00:05:47.440> them<00:05:47.590> I'll<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:47.920> feel<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.460> to

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
nobody wants them I'll just feel it to

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.100 
nobody wants them I'll just feel it to
see<00:05:48.760> if<00:05:48.850> there's<00:05:49.030> any<00:05:49.210> high<00:05:49.390> spots<00:05:49.450> there's

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
see if there's any high spots there's

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.740 
see if there's any high spots there's
one<00:05:50.320> right<00:05:50.530> there<00:05:50.940> let's<00:05:51.940> go<00:05:52.090> over<00:05:52.450> it<00:05:52.660> and

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
one right there let's go over it and

00:05:52.750 --> 00:06:10.930 
one right there let's go over it and
remove<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:54.750> very<00:05:55.750> small<00:05:56.200> cuts

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.720 

and<00:06:11.940> I<00:06:12.210> continue<00:06:12.660> to<00:06:12.780> go<00:06:12.930> around<00:06:13.490> around<00:06:14.490> that

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
and I continue to go around around that

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:51.010 
and I continue to go around around that
down<00:06:15.120> do<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:16.340> wine<00:06:17.340> gone

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.800 

okay<00:06:51.800> there<00:06:52.790> you<00:06:52.910> have<00:06:53.120> it<00:06:53.980> just<00:06:54.980> along<00:06:55.810> the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
okay there you have it just along the

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.960 
okay there you have it just along the
bottom<00:06:57.020> section<00:06:57.770> but<00:06:58.340> you<00:06:58.430> want<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.700> look<00:06:58.790> at

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
bottom section but you want to look at

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.030 
bottom section but you want to look at
it<00:06:59.090> from<00:06:59.210> all<00:06:59.450> angles<00:06:59.780> make<00:07:00.410> sure<00:07:00.620> that<00:07:00.770> it's<00:07:00.950> a

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
it from all angles make sure that it's a

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.970 
it from all angles make sure that it's a
nice<00:07:01.220> accurate<00:07:02.080> goes<00:07:03.080> up<00:07:03.260> against<00:07:03.530> the<00:07:03.800> line

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
nice accurate goes up against the line

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.880 
nice accurate goes up against the line
all<00:07:04.340> the<00:07:04.520> way<00:07:04.550> around<00:07:04.910> and<00:07:05.630> look<00:07:06.560> at<00:07:06.680> it<00:07:06.770> from

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
all the way around and look at it from

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.460 
all the way around and look at it from
all<00:07:07.040> different<00:07:07.280> angles<00:07:08.110> make<00:07:09.110> sure<00:07:09.290> that

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
all different angles make sure that

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.520 
all different angles make sure that
there's<00:07:09.680> no<00:07:09.920> flat<00:07:10.430> spots<00:07:11.050> now<00:07:12.050> there's<00:07:12.320> some

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
there's no flat spots now there's some

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.230 
there's no flat spots now there's some
things<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:12.830> I<00:07:12.920> probably<00:07:13.190> will<00:07:13.430> be<00:07:13.610> adjusting

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
things that I probably will be adjusting

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.170
