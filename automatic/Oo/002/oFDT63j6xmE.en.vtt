is<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.010> favorites<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.760> survival

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
is one of my favorites it's a survival

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.300 
is one of my favorites it's a survival
island<00:03:33.390> seed<00:03:33.900> which<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.320> generally<00:03:34.740> enjoy<00:03:35.040> but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
island seed which I generally enjoy but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
island seed which I generally enjoy but
this<00:03:35.460> one<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.940> quite<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.330> bit<00:03:36.540> different<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:37.140> we

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
this one is quite a bit different as we

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.830 
this one is quite a bit different as we
got<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> ton<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.040> livestock<00:03:38.460> on<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.000> island<00:03:39.360> and

again<00:03:58.470> one<00:03:59.130> thing<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.820> there's<00:04:00.030> another

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
again one thing that and there's another

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.910 
again one thing that and there's another
chicken<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:01.110> thing<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.440> island<00:04:01.860> doesn't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
chicken one thing this island doesn't

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.190 
chicken one thing this island doesn't
have<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.580> tree<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.210> if<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.750> look<00:04:04.020> over

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
have is a tree but if you just look over

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.390 
have is a tree but if you just look over
there<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.560> horizon<00:04:04.740> you're<00:04:05.220> going<00:04:05.340> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
there on the horizon you're going to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400 
there on the horizon you're going to
have<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.640> get<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> little<00:04:05.940> bit<00:04:06.060> wet<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.990> is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
have to get a little bit wet and that is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.100 
have to get a little bit wet and that is
West<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.420> can<00:04:09.420> go<00:04:09.510> get<00:04:09.630> all<00:04:09.750> your<00:04:09.870> wood

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
West and you can go get all your wood

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.900 
West and you can go get all your wood
over<00:04:10.350> there<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.770> then<00:04:11.130> come<00:04:11.370> back<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.610> start

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
over there and then come back and start

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.960 
over there and then come back and start
building<00:04:12.090> here<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.950> number<00:04:14.490> three<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
building here so that is number three of

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.670 
building here so that is number three of
our<00:04:15.090> seed<00:04:15.360> highlights<00:04:15.720> now<00:04:16.049> things<00:04:16.440> really

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
our seed highlights now things really

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.080 
our seed highlights now things really
start<00:04:17.010> getting<00:04:17.070> cool<00:04:17.460> as<00:04:17.730> we're<00:04:17.910> getting

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
start getting cool as we're getting

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.120 
start getting cool as we're getting
closer<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.450> number<00:04:18.810> one<00:04:18.989> basically<00:04:19.950> this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
closer to number one basically this

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.400 
closer to number one basically this
hasn't<00:04:20.460> rendered<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:20.880> yet<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.109> can<00:04:22.290> go

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
hasn't rendered in yet and you can go

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.780 
hasn't rendered in yet and you can go

not very far from our spawn point but we

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.060 
not very far from our spawn point but we
got<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.390> huge<00:05:09.930> nether<00:05:10.380> fortress<00:05:10.890> all
