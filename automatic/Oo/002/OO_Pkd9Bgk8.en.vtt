00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
preview of the sound but I guess we'll
finally<00:01:47.430> find<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.509> once<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
finally find out what that is once you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.399 
finally find out what that is once you
your<00:01:49.799> phone<00:01:50.009> starts<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> die<00:01:51.259> next<00:01:52.259> right

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
your phone starts to die next right

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.719 
your phone starts to die next right
there<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.799> turn<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.159> whether<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.490> want

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there you can turn off whether I want

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.940 
there you can turn off whether I want
whether<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.560> respect

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
whether or not you want it's a respect

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
whether or not you want it's a respect
silent<00:01:56.310> mode<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.909> silent<00:01:57.329> mode

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
silent mode so if you're on silent mode

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
silent mode so if you're on silent mode
and<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:58.079> phone's<00:01:58.320> about<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.590> die<00:01:58.710> it'll<00:01:59.100> make

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and your phone's about to die it'll make

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.770 
and your phone's about to die it'll make
a<00:01:59.280> noise<00:01:59.520> whether<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.180> you're<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.390> silent

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
a noise whether or not you're on silent

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
a noise whether or not you're on silent
mode<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
mode I have that on because I like to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
mode I have that on because I like to
know<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.180> phone's<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.570> die<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
know if my phone's gonna die or not and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.920 
know if my phone's gonna die or not and
then<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.509> an<00:02:06.630> option

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
then down here you also have an option

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.510 
then down here you also have an option
to<00:02:06.960> power<00:02:07.350> down<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> certain<00:02:08.009> battery

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to power down at a certain battery

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.690 
to power down at a certain battery
percentage<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.869> mine<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.289> 10%<00:02:11.069> which

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
percentage so I have mine at 10% which

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460 
percentage so I have mine at 10% which
I'm<00:02:12.000> pretty<00:02:12.270> sure

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.500 
I'm pretty sure
is<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.890> normal<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.030> starts<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.390> shut

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
is the normal what it starts to shut

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750 
is the normal what it starts to shut
down<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.350> maybe<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:16.890> 6%<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:17.640> not

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
down at or maybe it's like 6% I'm not

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
down at or maybe it's like 6% I'm not
really<00:02:17.910> sure<00:02:18.180> exactly<00:02:18.480> I've<00:02:18.840> never<00:02:19.050> really

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
really sure exactly I've never really

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.580 
really sure exactly I've never really
had<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.760> died<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.780> me<00:02:21.960> I'm<00:02:22.080> there<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.350> not

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
had it died on me I'm there really not

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.560 
had it died on me I'm there really not
had<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.010> charge<00:02:23.610> my<00:02:23.790> F<00:02:23.910> when<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> car
