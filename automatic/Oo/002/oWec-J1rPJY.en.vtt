00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you would have seen that these rocks

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
you would have seen that these rocks
were<00:00:22.890> covered<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.369> algae<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.660> sand<00:00:24.990> was

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
were covered with algae the sand was

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.210 
were covered with algae the sand was
covered<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:25.560> brown<00:00:25.949> diatomaceous<00:00:26.730> algae

covered with brown diatomaceous algae

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
covered with brown diatomaceous algae
and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.720> try<00:00:31.080> hard<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and I really really had to try hard and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.690 
and I really really had to try hard and
force<00:00:32.399> myself<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.300> scrub<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> rocks

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
force myself to not scrub the rocks

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
force myself to not scrub the rocks
I<00:00:35.760> left<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> rocks<00:00:36.570> alone<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> cleaner

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I left the rocks alone and the cleaner

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
I left the rocks alone and the cleaner
crew<00:00:38.940> did<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> great<00:00:39.420> job<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.430> the

crew did a great job you can see the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.750 
crew did a great job you can see the
sand<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.000> primarily<00:00:42.719> clear<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.469> brown<00:00:43.920> dices

green<00:00:49.020> hair<00:00:49.289> algae<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:49.980> bad<00:00:50.160> hair

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
green hair algae there was some bad hair

of<00:00:54.360> hair<00:00:54.480> algae<00:00:54.750> left<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.550> there's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of hair algae left you can see there's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
of hair algae left you can see there's
one<00:00:56.760> spot<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> ninja

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
left corner there's no one other spot I
also<00:01:05.159> had<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.400> cyanobacteria<00:01:05.850> last<00:01:06.510> week

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
also had some cyanobacteria last week

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
also had some cyanobacteria last week
and<00:01:07.020> unfortunately<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:07.830> actually

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and unfortunately that has actually

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.750 
and unfortunately that has actually
gotten<00:01:08.369> worse<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> spot<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.760> red

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
gotten worse I have a spot there red

photosynthetic<00:01:14.250> bacteria<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.270> it's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
photosynthetic bacteria you can see it's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
photosynthetic bacteria you can see it's
producing<00:01:15.689> some<00:01:15.840> gas<00:01:16.049> bubbles<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.909> will

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
producing some gas bubbles there it will

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
producing some gas bubbles there it will
negatively<00:01:18.509> affect<00:01:18.780> corals<00:01:19.580> right<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.790> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the middle those two around things are

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.960 
the middle those two around things are
too<00:01:24.530> small<00:01:25.530> leather<00:01:25.770> frags<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.580> came<00:01:26.820> with

too small leather frags that came with
the<00:01:27.060> rock<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.450> rock<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.840> used<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.290> previous

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the rock this rock was used in previous

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020 
the rock this rock was used in previous
tank<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.520> corals<00:01:29.909> were

tank and some of the corals were

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.990 
tank and some of the corals were
actually<00:01:30.329> hitchhikers<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> rock<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
actually hitchhikers on the rock and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.340 
actually hitchhikers on the rock and
those<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.240> leathers<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.900> opened<00:01:34.079> up

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
those two leathers have not opened up

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.390 
those two leathers have not opened up
since<00:01:34.560> they've<00:01:34.680> been<00:01:34.710> swallowed<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.280> the

since they've been swallowed up by the
saddle<00:01:35.759> bacteria<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> my<00:01:38.130> next<00:01:38.400> video<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
saddle bacteria and in my next video I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.859 
saddle bacteria and in my next video I
will<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.060> over<00:01:39.270> how<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.659> rid<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
will go over how to get rid of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
will go over how to get rid of
cyanobacteria<00:01:41.000> with<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> product<00:01:42.390> called

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
cyanobacteria with a product called

cyanobacteria with a product called
Kimmy<00:01:42.960> clean<00:01:44.780> what<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> noticed<00:01:46.259> after<00:01:46.619> adding

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
Kimmy clean what I noticed after adding

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.109 
Kimmy clean what I noticed after adding
a<00:01:47.100> cleaner<00:01:47.369> crew<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:49.140> seemed<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> snails

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
a cleaner crew it seemed like the snails

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.899 
a cleaner crew it seemed like the snails
primarily<00:01:51.119> focused<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> rock<00:01:51.960> work<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
primarily focused on the rock work and

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.639 
primarily focused on the rock work and
the<00:01:53.909> crabs<00:01:54.210> primarily<00:01:54.780> focused<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> on

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the crabs primarily focused on the on

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.719 
the crabs primarily focused on the on
the<00:01:55.890> sand<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:58.979> took<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.579> really

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the sand and it really took it really

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
the sand and it really took it really
took<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> good<00:02:00.299> full<00:02:00.990> seven<00:02:01.770> days<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.219> the

took a good full seven days to get the

bacteria which I just showed you and
we'll<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.010> how<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.550> rid<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.090> in

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the next video the third thing is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.290 
the next video the third thing is
actually<00:02:51.510> creating<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.140> game<00:02:52.410> plan<00:02:53.209> for<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
actually creating a game plan for the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.380 
actually creating a game plan for the
corals<00:02:54.770> specifically<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.970> may<00:02:57.120> sound

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
corals specifically so this may sound

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.670 
corals specifically so this may sound
silly<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.990> actually<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.470> draw<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
silly but what I actually do is draw a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.890 
silly but what I actually do is draw a
sketch<00:02:59.180> doesn't<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.450> anything<00:03:00.600> fancy

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
sketch doesn't have to be anything fancy

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.120 
sketch doesn't have to be anything fancy
of<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.459> rockwork<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.810> actually<00:03:03.990> draw<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
of the rockwork and I actually draw the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.350 
of the rockwork and I actually draw the
corals<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.760> place

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
corals in place

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.570 
corals in place
now<00:03:07.170> most<00:03:07.470> nano<00:03:07.709> reefs<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.310> anything

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
now most nano reefs and anything

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.710 
now most nano reefs and anything
underneath<00:03:08.820> 30<00:03:09.120> gallons<00:03:09.510> would<00:03:09.600> be

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
underneath 30 gallons would be

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.449 
underneath 30 gallons would be
considered<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.200> nano<00:03:10.380> reef

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
considered a nano reef

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.900 
considered a nano reef
most<00:03:11.910> people<00:03:12.150> use<00:03:12.269> frags<00:03:13.019> coral<00:03:13.800> frags<00:03:14.100> for

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
most people use frags coral frags for

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.340 
most people use frags coral frags for
their<00:03:15.030> reef<00:03:15.239> tanks<00:03:15.690> because<00:03:16.080> they're<00:03:16.200> less

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
their reef tanks because they're less

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.009 
their reef tanks because they're less
expensive<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.220> watch<00:03:17.400> them<00:03:17.640> grow

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
expensive and they can watch them grow

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.540 
expensive and they can watch them grow
which<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.230> makes<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.530> lot<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.709> sense<00:03:20.070> but<00:03:20.400> I've

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
which that makes a lot of sense but I've

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.910 
which that makes a lot of sense but I've
set<00:03:20.850> up<00:03:20.970> numerous<00:03:21.239> nano<00:03:22.080> reefs<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.709> would

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
set up numerous nano reefs and would

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.470 
set up numerous nano reefs and would
like<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.070> do<00:03:23.220> something<00:03:23.430> different<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:23.940> time

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
like to do something different this time

like to do something different this time
and<00:03:25.350> I'm<00:03:25.470> kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.769> considering<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.220> tank<00:03:26.459> my

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
and I'm kind of considering this tank my

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.910 
and I'm kind of considering this tank my

these corals today in the upper regions
of<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.150> tank<00:04:29.390> I'm<00:04:29.570> going<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.750> be<00:04:29.810> adding<00:04:30.110> you

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
of the tank I'm going to be adding you

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.780 
of the tank I'm going to be adding you
know<00:04:30.230> some<00:04:30.440> polyps<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.040> some<00:04:31.130> leather<00:04:31.310> corals

know some polyps and some leather corals

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.110 
know some polyps and some leather corals
and<00:04:32.330> so<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.440> tank<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.860> slowly<00:04:34.310> starting<00:04:35.060> to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
and so the tank is slowly starting to

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.650 
and so the tank is slowly starting to
take<00:04:35.360> shape

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
take shape

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.430 
take shape
now<00:04:36.200> when<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.380> talk<00:04:36.590> about<00:04:36.740> difficulty<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.520> care

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
now when I talk about difficulty of care

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.010 
now when I talk about difficulty of care
we<00:04:39.440> rank<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.740> corals<00:04:40.070> one<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.340> five<00:04:40.840> one<00:04:41.840> is
