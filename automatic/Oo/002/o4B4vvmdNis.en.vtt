ahead and remove the two screws that are
attaching<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> driver's<00:00:44.520> side<00:00:44.550> panel

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
attaching it to the driver's side panel

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.860 
attaching it to the driver's side panel
here<00:00:45.980> set<00:00:46.980> those<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> side<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here set those over to the side and the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.000 
here set those over to the side and the
bracket<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
bracket here we can actually take and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670 
bracket here we can actually take and
just<00:00:50.160> flex<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.610> forward<00:00:51.260> give<00:00:52.260> us<00:00:52.379> enough<00:00:52.590> room

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
just flex it forward give us enough room

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
just flex it forward give us enough room
to<00:00:52.860> pull<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> panel<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.520> alright<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> we

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to pull the panel back alright and we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
to pull the panel back alright and we
move<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> removing<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> panel<00:00:55.829> next<00:00:56.219> door

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
move on and removing the panel next door

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
move on and removing the panel next door
but<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> Phillips<00:00:57.420> head<00:00:57.539> screws<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> are

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
but if you Phillips head screws that are

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.450 
but if you Phillips head screws that are
holding<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.440> place<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.010> first<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
holding it in place we first want to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
holding it in place we first want to
take<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> ones<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> rear<00:01:00.449> threshold

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
take the ones out of the rear threshold

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
take the ones out of the rear threshold
we<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> probably<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.920> away<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we can probably get away with just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.680 
we can probably get away with just
taking<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> driver

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
taking the two over here on the driver

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
taking the two over here on the driver
side<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.650> move<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> panel<00:01:05.729> here

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
side out and we move up the panel here

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.100 
side out and we move up the panel here
you<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.210> we've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.630> Phillips<00:01:06.960> head

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you see we've got two Phillips head

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.760 
you see we've got two Phillips head
screws<00:01:09.229> here<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> inboard<00:01:10.710> side<00:01:12.740> one<00:01:13.740> more

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
screws here on the inboard side one more

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
screws here on the inboard side one more
here<00:01:15.920> from<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
here from there we can just take it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.860 
here from there we can just take it
start<00:01:17.970> pulling<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> panel<00:01:18.479> back

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.210 

all<00:01:24.870> right<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.230> that<00:01:25.380> pulled<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.100> can

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
all right with that pulled back you can

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.710 
all right with that pulled back you can
see<00:01:26.400> we've<00:01:26.550> got<00:01:26.730> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> makeshift

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
see we've got kind of a makeshift

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
see we've got kind of a makeshift
junction<00:01:28.170> point<00:01:28.440> with<00:01:28.740> four<00:01:28.980> connectors<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
junction point with four connectors the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
junction point with four connectors the
one<00:01:30.780> furthest<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.410> rear<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.220> be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
one furthest to the rear is going to be

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.110 
one furthest to the rear is going to be
the<00:01:32.370> one<00:01:32.490> we're<00:01:32.670> looking<00:01:32.700> for

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
the one we're looking for

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.160 
the one we're looking for
that's<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.720> we're<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:33.990> plugging

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that's the one we're gonna be plugging

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's the one we're gonna be plugging
our<00:01:34.320> wiring<00:01:34.380> harness<00:01:34.710> into<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.580> we<00:01:35.700> could<00:01:35.790> take

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
our wiring harness into so we could take

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.150 
our wiring harness into so we could take
and<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.540> separate<00:01:37.020> those<00:01:37.230> two<00:01:37.260> see<00:01:37.980> there's

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
and would separate those two see there's

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.590 
and would separate those two see there's
a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.430> tab<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:38.970> bottom<00:01:39.270> press

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
a little tab here at the bottom press

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
a little tab here at the bottom press
that<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.020> pull<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> two<00:01:40.860> apart<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.370> right

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that in and pull the two apart all right

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
that in and pull the two apart all right
we<00:01:41.670> next<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.300> wiring<00:01:42.510> harness

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
we next could take our wiring harness

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.520 
we next could take our wiring harness
