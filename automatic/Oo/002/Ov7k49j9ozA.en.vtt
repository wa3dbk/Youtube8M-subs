 I realized this topic that the truth 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.359
 it seemed very very important and so it is that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.130
 Chechnya pointed out that the supply of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 armament to ukraine by usa what 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.960
 would see as a sign of adopting the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.750
 appropriate measures and what are those 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 measures as it threatens to deliver more 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.320
 barack president obama sends weapons 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.560
 lethal to the government 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.680
 to fight with the Russian insurgents the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.660
 low youtube help for mexico would be 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.940
 that we have modern lethal weapons for

 mexico arizona nevada yuta colorado and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.670
 part of wyoming the president of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 Chechnya argued that from the second 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.170
 world war has not been spent nor a 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.290
 US dollar in the development of 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.380
 Ukraine while Russia and Ukraine 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.060
 they have always been brother countries so 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 that the white house does not have to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.860
 stick their noses in conflicts 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.500
 current of these two countries after 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.119
 little time in Moscow Russia said that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 they did not agree with what the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.270
 President of the Chechen Parliament 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.039
 had already said that the subjects of the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.039
 Russian federation can not supply 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.470
 armament abroad not much less 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.840
 sell them so no no we 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.660
 we are excited that they will give us weapons to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.119
 share in the USA and recover what we 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.400
 belongs is that without doubt this defeat 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.400
 Well, it's a bit interesting, so 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.530
 said the president 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.800
 but even so it does not have foundations since 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.320
 Russia said that they could not do this the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 chechens since the parliament does not 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.470
 It allows 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.960
 comment what do you think about this video and what 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.700
 that the president commented about the 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.390
 conflicts that are happening in ukraine 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.110
 and russia and what he wanted or tried to do 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.660
 this president to say to support us 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.040
 to recover our part that was 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 stolen in the past 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.460
