brushes now this one is for free and
this<00:03:29.859> is<00:03:29.980> probably<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.549> best<00:03:31.090> hands<00:03:31.599> dying

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
this is probably the best hands dying

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.949 
this is probably the best hands dying

the vast drawing application for iOS

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.080 
the vast drawing application for iOS
it's<00:03:35.920> probably<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.370> be<00:03:36.430> more<00:03:36.700> for<00:03:36.970> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
it's probably going to be more for you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.599 
it's probably going to be more for you
RT<00:03:37.599> people<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.139> people<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.799> ipod<00:03:39.130> simply

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
RT people on people on the ipod simply

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.789 
RT people on people on the ipod simply
because<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> bigger<00:03:40.599> screen<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.650> as<00:03:41.709> you

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
because it is a bigger screen so as you

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.440 
because it is a bigger screen so as you
can<00:03:41.889> see<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.280> updated<00:03:42.760> for<00:03:42.910> life<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.180> five

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
can see it is updated for life in five

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.050 
can see it is updated for life in five
and<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.049> actually<00:03:44.200> create<00:03:45.040> custom<00:03:45.849> and

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
and you can actually create custom and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.849 
and you can actually create custom and
sizes<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.049> it's<00:03:47.169> kind<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.470> bit<00:03:47.680> like

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
sizes so it's kind of a bit like

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.009 
sizes so it's kind of a bit like

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
you can see and we decide select your

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.330 
you can see and we decide select your
color<00:04:09.880> obviously<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.349> we'll<00:04:11.560> just<00:04:11.739> draw<00:04:12.010> but

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
color obviously so we'll just draw but

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.339 
color obviously so we'll just draw but
no<00:04:12.519> that's<00:04:12.669> not<00:04:12.790> coming<00:04:13.209> up<00:04:13.269> too<00:04:13.510> well<00:04:13.720> the

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
no that's not coming up too well the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.750 
no that's not coming up too well the
colors<00:04:14.650> don't<00:04:14.769> really<00:04:15.010> work<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.519> color

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
colors don't really work in the color

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.670 
colors don't really work in the color
wheel<00:04:16.060> that's<00:04:16.329> with<00:04:16.510> my<00:04:16.630> art<00:04:16.840> teacher<00:04:17.109> told<00:04:17.560> me

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
wheel that's with my art teacher told me

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.459 
wheel that's with my art teacher told me
ante<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:18.789> as<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.090> can<00:04:19.209> see<00:04:19.269> if<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.169> invert

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:20.469 
ante now as you can see if you invert

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.589 
ante now as you can see if you invert
the<00:04:20.620> colors<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:21.070> changes<00:04:21.700> them<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.330> on<00:04:22.450> if<00:04:22.510> we

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
the colors it changes them but on if we

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.029 
the colors it changes them but on if we
just<00:04:22.750> put<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> nice<00:04:23.110> white<00:04:23.380> background<00:04:23.800> as<00:04:23.950> you

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
just put a nice white background as you

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:24.360 
just put a nice white background as you
can<00:04:24.130> see

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
can see

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.820 
can see
looks<00:04:24.580> ten<00:04:24.910> times<00:04:24.940> better<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.620> draw

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
looks ten times better and we just draw

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070 
looks ten times better and we just draw
some<00:04:27.070> wavy<00:04:27.460> lines<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.330> now<00:04:28.419> if<00:04:28.479> we<00:04:28.510> get<00:04:28.720> into

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
some wavy lines so now if we get into

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.810 
some wavy lines so now if we get into
our<00:04:29.110> project<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.010> would<00:04:30.070> do<00:04:30.250> something<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.760> bit

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
our project and would do something a bit

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.330 
our project and would do something a bit
more<00:04:31.030> professional<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:32.380> now<00:04:32.500> if<00:04:32.590> we<00:04:32.650> just<00:04:32.830> draw

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
more professional so now if we just draw

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.360 
more professional so now if we just draw
a<00:04:33.460> line<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.540> will<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:36.100> what<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.310> can

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
a line in this and will so what you can

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.189 
a line in this and will so what you can
see<00:04:36.430> I'm<00:04:36.729> just<00:04:36.790> going<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.180> do<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> very<00:04:37.540> nice<00:04:37.810> and

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
see I'm just going to do a very nice and

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.920 
see I'm just going to do a very nice and
you<00:04:38.889> know<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.430> nice<00:04:39.580> pattern<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.300> use

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
you know just a nice pattern and use

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.990 
you know just a nice pattern and use
different<00:04:41.320> colors<00:04:41.650> now<00:04:42.280> i'm<00:04:42.400> using<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.729> stylus

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
different colors now i'm using a stylus

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.150 
different colors now i'm using a stylus
for<00:04:43.389> this<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.780> don't<00:04:43.960> know<00:04:44.050> if<00:04:44.199> we<00:04:44.470> have<00:04:44.740> one<00:04:44.770> but

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
for this I don't know if we have one but

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.950 
for this I don't know if we have one but
I<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.550> stylus<00:04:45.910> might<00:04:46.120> make<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.810> bit

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
I think a stylus might make it a bit

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.080 
I think a stylus might make it a bit
better<00:04:47.199> I<00:04:47.470> actually<00:04:47.889> did<00:04:48.190> review<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.790> on<00:04:48.940> my
