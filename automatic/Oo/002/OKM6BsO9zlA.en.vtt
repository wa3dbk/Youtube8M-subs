00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
type in times the memory ram you got for

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.530 
type in times the memory ram you got for
me<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.340> 4<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.150> 4<00:01:33.900> equal<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.979> joe<00:01:35.280> 6<00:01:35.549> 9<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.060> after

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
me is 4 so 4 equal for joe 6 9 and after

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.840 
me is 4 so 4 equal for joe 6 9 and after
you<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.470> need<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> click<00:01:37.950> times<00:01:39.619> 1.5

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
you do this you need to click times 1.5

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.060 
you do this you need to click times 1.5
so<00:01:42.140> equals<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.850> 6<00:01:44.850> 1<00:01:45.119> 4<00:01:45.360> 4<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.049> yeah<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so equals to 6 1 4 4 so yeah this is the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.690 
so equals to 6 1 4 4 so yeah this is the
maximum<00:01:48.030> ram<00:01:48.299> i<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
maximum ram i can put in my this is the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
maximum ram i can put in my this is the
maximum<00:01:51.270> RAM<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.869> change<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.439> my

maximum RAM I can change you into my

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
maximum RAM I can change you into my
laptop<00:01:53.240> different<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.750> different
