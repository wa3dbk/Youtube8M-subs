after<00:02:29.600> finishing<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.470> project<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.040> found

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
after finishing the project and I found

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.890 
after finishing the project and I found
the<00:02:31.430> metal<00:02:31.700> strip<00:02:31.970> would<00:02:32.120> drop<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the metal strip would drop back and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.020 
the metal strip would drop back and
forth<00:02:33.200> which<00:02:33.740> made<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.100> hole<00:02:34.280> jig<00:02:34.520> look<00:02:34.760> very

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
forth which made the hole jig look very

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.080 
forth which made the hole jig look very
unstable<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.620> drill<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.310> hole<00:02:37.580> on<00:02:37.610> each

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
unstable so drill out one hole on each
