00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
should know roughly from a tire how many

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
should know roughly from a tire how many
miles<00:01:46.409> you're<00:01:46.590> gonna<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.189> most<00:01:47.850> bikes

it's a good tire but if we were planning
a<00:02:46.060> 5,000<00:02:46.629> mile<00:02:46.750> trip<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.079> would<00:02:47.260> put<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.409> new<00:02:47.590> one

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
a 5,000 mile trip I would put a new one

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.949 
a 5,000 mile trip I would put a new one
on<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.220> brand<00:02:48.670> new<00:02:48.819> one<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.750> doesn't

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959

only<00:03:07.359> really<00:03:07.870> because<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.409> age<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.889> those

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
only really because the age of those

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.949 
only really because the age of those
tires<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.519> then<00:03:09.700> different<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.750> even

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
tires is then different if you even

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.140 
tires is then different if you even
you've<00:03:11.290> mixed<00:03:11.500> them<00:03:11.709> up<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.700> don't

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you've mixed them up and I just don't

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.580 
you've mixed them up and I just don't
like<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.359> if<00:03:13.989> you're<00:03:14.170> planning<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.560> trip

looks it's irrelevant if that sprocket

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.249 
looks it's irrelevant if that sprocket
is<00:05:21.009> allowing<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.639> chain<00:05:21.909> to<00:05:22.539> move<00:05:22.719> free<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.139> it

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.439 
is allowing the chain to move free of it
and<00:05:24.249> then<00:05:24.339> it<00:05:24.430> needs<00:05:24.520> replacing<00:05:24.759> anything

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
and then it needs replacing anything

thousands<00:05:28.029> of<00:05:28.120> miles<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.419> should<00:05:28.689> have

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
thousands of miles you should have

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.059 
thousands of miles you should have
enough<00:05:28.990> money<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.259> put<00:05:29.469> hundred<00:05:29.740> pound<00:05:29.889> chain

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069
