backs
one<00:00:34.780> thing<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.170> note<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:35.530> that<00:00:35.590> some<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.280> these

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
one thing to note is that some of these

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.360 
one thing to note is that some of these
fit<00:00:36.820> better<00:00:37.090> than<00:00:37.329> others<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.649> they<00:00:38.950> do<00:00:39.010> fit

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
fit better than others but they do fit

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.610 
fit better than others but they do fit
close<00:00:39.579> enough<00:00:39.880> that<00:00:40.120> if<00:00:40.239> you<00:00:40.390> just<00:00:40.600> use<00:00:41.320> enough

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
close enough that if you just use enough

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.049 
close enough that if you just use enough
glue<00:00:41.649> they<00:00:42.370> work<00:00:42.550> fine

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
glue they work fine

so it may not sit totally flat down in
there<00:00:47.290> but<00:00:47.710> it'll<00:00:47.920> be<00:00:48.100> fine

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
bit and get it to go inside the bezel so

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
bit and get it to go inside the bezel so
what<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> did<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.310> first<00:02:32.519> time<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.060> went

what I did the first time was I went

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.940 
what I did the first time was I went
ahead<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.599> did<00:02:34.760> two<00:02:35.760> or<00:02:35.970> three<00:02:36.000> at<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> time

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
ahead and did two or three at a time

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.490 
ahead and did two or three at a time
because<00:02:37.950> they<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.489> fall<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:38.959> set<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
because they do fall out set it for a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.289 
because they do fall out set it for a
few<00:02:40.739> minutes<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.100> let<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> glue<00:02:41.519> set<00:02:41.549> up<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
few minutes to let the glue set up a

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.259 
few minutes to let the glue set up a
little<00:02:42.450> bit<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> next<00:02:44.519> two<00:02:45.150> or

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
little bit and then do the next two or

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:54.910 
little bit and then do the next two or
