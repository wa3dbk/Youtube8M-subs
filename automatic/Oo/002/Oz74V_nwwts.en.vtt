55-ton and his trail is 50 / 55 done so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.619 
55-ton and his trail is 50 / 55 done so
they<00:00:45.030> both<00:00:45.239> hydraulic<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.789> trick<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.480> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
they both hydraulic the trick with this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
they both hydraulic the trick with this
one<00:00:48.899> he<00:00:49.110> said<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:50.010> maya<00:00:50.340> doesn't

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
one he said that at maya doesn't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.029 
one he said that at maya doesn't
actually<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> 50-ton<00:00:52.079> trailer<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.770> what

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
actually have a 50-ton trailer so what

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.119 
actually have a 50-ton trailer so what
they<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.250> why<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.020> 50<00:00:55.440> /<00:00:55.680> 55

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
they do why they do it like this 50 / 55

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.389 
they do why they do it like this 50 / 55
it<00:00:56.550> means<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:58.230> 50<00:00:59.129> tons

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
it means that it can take 50 tons

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.959 
it means that it can take 50 tons
100,000<00:01:00.300> pounds<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> 12<00:01:00.960> feet<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
100,000 pounds and 12 feet or it can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.770 
100,000 pounds and 12 feet or it can
take<00:01:03.180> 55-ton<00:01:04.129> quote<00:01:05.129> evenly<00:01:05.909> distributed

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
take 55-ton quote evenly distributed

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.820 
take 55-ton quote evenly distributed
unquote<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.820> that's<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.030> total<00:01:09.390> BS<00:01:09.830> because

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
unquote and that's like total BS because

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
unquote and that's like total BS because
if<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.600> need<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:12.900> entire<00:01:13.229> length<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
if it's if you need an entire length of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.010 
if it's if you need an entire length of
the<00:01:13.860> trailer<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:14.460> 55-ton<00:01:15.270> that's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the trailer to take 55-ton that's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
the trailer to take 55-ton that's
useless<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> 50-ton

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
useless so basically it's a 50-ton

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
useless so basically it's a 50-ton
trailer<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.250> frame<00:01:20.520> capacity<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.360> much

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
trailer right so frame capacity is much

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
trailer right so frame capacity is much
stronger<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> no-name<00:01:24.420> 55-ton<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.740> i

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
stronger in the no-name 55-ton that i

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.719 
stronger in the no-name 55-ton that i
like<00:01:26.250> well<00:01:27.150> construction<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.950> steel<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
like well construction this steel is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
like well construction this steel is
more<00:01:29.939> expensive<00:01:30.210> hundred<00:01:30.960> K<00:01:31.140> psi<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.979> t1<00:01:32.490> steel

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
more expensive hundred K psi or t1 steel

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.719 
more expensive hundred K psi or t1 steel
is<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.240> expensive<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.990> also<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.799> more

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is more expensive but also it's more

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
is more expensive but also it's more
brittle<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:37.140> doesn't<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.000> cold<00:01:39.000> weather<00:01:39.590> for

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
brittle it doesn't like cold weather for

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
brittle it doesn't like cold weather for
example<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> talk<00:01:41.369> too<00:01:41.670> eager<00:01:42.420> beaver<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:44.240> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
example I talk too eager beaver at this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
example I talk too eager beaver at this
Kentucky<00:01:45.659> truck<00:01:46.049> show<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> guy<00:01:46.649> said<00:01:46.950> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Kentucky truck show on the guy said they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
Kentucky truck show on the guy said they
only<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.729> ATK<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.960> eighty<00:01:49.259> thousand<00:01:49.799> psi

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
only use ATK or eighty thousand psi

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.139 
only use ATK or eighty thousand psi
steel<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:51.000> their<00:01:51.149> trailers<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:53.149> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
steel for their trailers because that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.389 
steel for their trailers because that
steel<00:01:54.540> handles<00:01:55.020> cold<00:01:55.380> temperatures<00:01:56.130> better

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
steel handles cold temperatures better

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.920 
steel handles cold temperatures better
and<00:01:56.759> he<00:01:57.420> says<00:01:57.710> Alaska<00:01:59.420> companies<00:02:00.420> buy<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> lot

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and he says Alaska companies buy a lot

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
and he says Alaska companies buy a lot
of<00:02:00.960> those<00:02:01.229> trailers<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.850> why<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> don't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
of those trailers so that's why I don't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
of those trailers so that's why I don't
think<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.630> drawback<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.409> no<00:02:04.920> name

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
think it's a drawback that this no name

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.999 
think it's a drawback that this no name
trailer<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> uses<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> cheaper<00:02:06.630> combination

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
trailer it uses a cheaper combination

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.669 
trailer it uses a cheaper combination
I<00:02:08.069> sort<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.939> using<00:02:09.269> T<00:02:09.629> 1<00:02:09.840> steal<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.349> over<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I sort of using T 1 steal all over it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.140 
I sort of using T 1 steal all over it

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
deck length that's the main deck I made

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.199 
deck length that's the main deck I made
them<00:02:19.170> custom<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.829> both<00:02:20.010> trailers<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.970> pretty

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
them custom on both trailers so pretty

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.309 
them custom on both trailers so pretty
much<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.569> same<00:02:21.750> 26<00:02:22.579> 26<00:02:23.579> feet<00:02:23.790> long<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:24.900> lower

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
much the same 26 26 feet long now lower

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.789 
much the same 26 26 feet long now lower
deck<00:02:25.680> height<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.190> very<00:02:26.459> important<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:28.290> you

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
deck height is very important but you

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.740 
deck height is very important but you
also<00:02:28.890> what<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> notice<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.000> lots<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
also what I notice that lots of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
also what I notice that lots of
companies<00:02:31.230> basically<00:02:31.470> cheat<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:33.030> yeah

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
companies basically cheat because yeah

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.410 
companies basically cheat because yeah
they<00:02:33.540> show<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.079> top<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.970> small<00:02:35.970> number<00:02:36.390> but

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
they show you the top a small number but

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.300 
they show you the top a small number but
then<00:02:36.840> when<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.200> look<00:02:37.439> at<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.799> that's<00:02:38.189> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
then when you look at this that's the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.330 
then when you look at this that's the
spacing<00:02:39.000> from<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.019> ground<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.799> bottom<00:02:40.920> of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
spacing from the ground to the bottom of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.330 
spacing from the ground to the bottom of
the<00:02:41.430> deck<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.790> at<00:02:41.909> six<00:02:42.239> inches<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.890> basically

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the deck and at six inches so basically

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.690 
the deck and at six inches so basically
22-6<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.599> same<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.989> 24<00:02:46.739> 8<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:47.579> if

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
22-6 it's the same as 24 8 because if

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.330 
22-6 it's the same as 24 8 because if
you<00:02:47.819> raise<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> trailer<00:02:48.510> by<00:02:48.720> 2<00:02:48.780> inches<00:02:49.379> then

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
you raise the trailer by 2 inches then

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.309 
you raise the trailer by 2 inches then
the<00:02:50.489> top<00:02:50.670> becomes<00:02:51.000> 24<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.959> bottom

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
the top becomes 24 and the bottom

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.129 
the top becomes 24 and the bottom
becomes<00:02:52.620> 8<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.420> same<00:02:54.480> thing<00:02:54.900> just

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
becomes 8 so it's the same thing just

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.830 
becomes 8 so it's the same thing just
that<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:56.340> marketing<00:02:56.879> purposes<00:02:56.909> this<00:02:57.540> looks

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that for marketing purposes this looks

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.770 
that for marketing purposes this looks
better<00:02:58.139> but<00:02:58.790> with<00:02:59.790> any<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> these<00:03:00.269> trailers

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
better but with any of these trailers

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.379 
better but with any of these trailers
you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.079> always<00:03:01.409> either<00:03:02.280> put<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.359> a

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
you can always either put it down a

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.300 
you can always either put it down a
little<00:03:03.629> bit<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:04.139> raise<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
little bit or raise it up so it's the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.210 
little bit or raise it up so it's the
same<00:03:05.519> thing<00:03:05.870> okay<00:03:06.870> gooseneck<00:03:07.530> swing<00:03:07.980> radius

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
same thing okay gooseneck swing radius

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.520 
same thing okay gooseneck swing radius
that's<00:03:08.760> very<00:03:09.000> important<00:03:09.569> that's<00:03:09.780> how<00:03:09.989> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that's very important that's how that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
that's very important that's how that
determines<00:03:11.099> how<00:03:11.940> close<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:13.169> get<00:03:13.379> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
determines how close you can get the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.339 
determines how close you can get the
track<00:03:13.799> towards<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> trailer<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:15.989> can

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
track towards the trailer so you can

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.960 
track towards the trailer so you can
transfer<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.160> weight<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.849> have

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
transfer the weight when you have

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.729 
transfer the weight when you have
something<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.419> really<00:03:18.989> heavy<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.560> can

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
something like really heavy you can

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.699 
something like really heavy you can
transfer<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.400> lift<00:03:20.730> axle<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.389> truck

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
transfer to the lift axle on the truck

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.920 
transfer to the lift axle on the truck
right<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.389> bigger<00:03:24.629> this

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
right and so the the bigger this

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.830 
right and so the the bigger this
distance<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.739> better<00:03:26.099> but<00:03:26.370> here<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.660> only

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
distance is the better but here we only

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170 
distance is the better but here we only
have<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> difference<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> 1<00:03:28.919> inch<00:03:29.190> that's<00:03:29.910> no

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
have a difference of 1 inch that's no

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.979 
have a difference of 1 inch that's no
big<00:03:30.419> deal<00:03:30.629> now<00:03:31.260> flow<00:03:31.560> material<00:03:32.720> epitome<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.959> a

big deal now flow material epitome is a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.839 
big deal now flow material epitome is a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
basically it's kind of like a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.099 
basically it's kind of like a
construction<00:04:10.370> trailer<00:04:11.389> which<00:04:12.389> which<00:04:12.840> which

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
construction trailer which which which

is not designed to handle any irregular
loads<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> back<00:04:17.820> let's<00:04:18.180> say<00:04:18.389> some<00:04:18.750> skis<00:04:19.200> or

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
loads on the back let's say some skis or

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500 
loads on the back let's say some skis or
boxes<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.549> that's<00:04:20.760> what<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.150> at

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
boxes right so that's what this is at

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.779 
boxes right so that's what this is at
Nayar<00:04:21.810> has<00:04:22.370> open<00:04:23.370> wheel<00:04:23.610> wells<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.409> not<00:04:25.530> a

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
Nayar has open wheel wells so it's not a

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.279 
Nayar has open wheel wells so it's not a
transport<00:04:26.789> trailer<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.570> full<00:04:27.810> sense<00:04:28.110> it's

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
transport trailer in a full sense it's

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.940 
transport trailer in a full sense it's
more<00:04:28.650> like<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.860> real<00:04:30.590> construction<00:04:31.590> trailer

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
more like a real construction trailer

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.730 
more like a real construction trailer
whereas<00:04:32.340> here<00:04:32.789> I<00:04:32.969> was<00:04:33.690> able<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:34.169> specify<00:04:34.409> this

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
whereas here I was able to specify this

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.180 
whereas here I was able to specify this
option<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:35.820> costs<00:04:36.180> about<00:04:37.190> sixteen

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
option and this costs about sixteen

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.709 
option and this costs about sixteen
hundred<00:04:38.460> dollars<00:04:38.820> because<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.599> to

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
hundred dollars because you have to

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.540 
hundred dollars because you have to
cover<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.200> wheels<00:04:40.440> were<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> metal<00:04:41.159> panels

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
cover the wheels were the metal panels

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.180 
cover the wheels were the metal panels
and<00:04:41.760> then<00:04:41.849> you<00:04:41.940> have<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.240> cover<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:44.070> have

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and then you have to cover the you have

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.379 
and then you have to cover the you have
to<00:04:44.340> reinforce<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:45.300> put<00:04:46.169> extra<00:04:46.940> cross<00:04:47.940> members

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
to reinforce the put extra cross members

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.300 
to reinforce the put extra cross members
and<00:04:48.599> put<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.960> floor<00:04:49.229> over<00:04:49.469> them<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.010> this

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
and put the floor over them so this

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.019 
and put the floor over them so this
trailer<00:04:51.260> then<00:04:52.260> only<00:04:52.469> in<00:04:52.650> 55<00:04:53.310> country<00:04:53.789> has<00:04:54.000> a

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:54.029 
trailer then only in 55 country has a

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.570 
trailer then only in 55 country has a

and he said well actually I axle is
25,000<00:05:38.990> but<00:05:39.990> we<00:05:40.139> use<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.409> slightly<00:05:41.279> smaller

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
25,000 but we use a slightly smaller

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.560 
25,000 but we use a slightly smaller
brakes<00:05:42.560> because<00:05:43.560> our<00:05:44.029> customers<00:05:45.029> complained

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
brakes because our customers complained

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.719 
brakes because our customers complained
when<00:05:45.870> we<00:05:46.110> use<00:05:46.289> those<00:05:46.500> heavy<00:05:46.830> duty<00:05:47.190> breaks<00:05:47.520> that

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
when we use those heavy duty breaks that

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.000 
when we use those heavy duty breaks that
they<00:05:47.760> were<00:05:48.090> in<00:05:48.300> on<00:05:48.450> doing<00:05:49.349> something<00:05:49.620> there

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
they were in on doing something there

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.209 
they were in on doing something there
that<00:05:50.039> they<00:05:50.700> didn't<00:05:50.940> like<00:05:51.710> well<00:05:52.710> I'm<00:05:52.860> not<00:05:53.010> so

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
that they didn't like well I'm not so

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.459 
that they didn't like well I'm not so
technical<00:05:53.849> so<00:05:54.060> me<00:05:54.419> personally<00:05:55.050> like<00:05:55.080> this

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
technical so me personally like this

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.379 
technical so me personally like this
number<00:05:55.800> 25<00:05:56.279> thousand<00:05:56.729> that<00:05:56.849> means<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.180> more

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
number 25 thousand that means a more

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.950 
number 25 thousand that means a more
robust<00:05:57.930> axle<00:05:58.610> now<00:05:59.610> tires<00:06:00.000> are<00:06:00.300> important<00:06:00.779> and

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
robust axle now tires are important and

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.920 
robust axle now tires are important and
the<00:06:01.680> first<00:06:01.949> number<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.669> width<00:06:03.539> in

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
the first number is the width in

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.129 
the first number is the width in
millimeters<00:06:04.830> as<00:06:05.330> measured<00:06:06.330> across<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.900> tire

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
millimeters as measured across the tire

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.640 
millimeters as measured across the tire
so<00:06:07.469> 275<00:06:08.219> tires<00:06:08.610> are<00:06:08.909> always<00:06:09.360> cost<00:06:09.690> they<00:06:10.469> always

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
so 275 tires are always cost they always

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.310 
so 275 tires are always cost they always
cost<00:06:11.039> a<00:06:11.190> premium<00:06:11.639> as<00:06:11.760> compared<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.240> 255<00:06:12.990> tire

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
cost a premium as compared to 255 tire

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.430 
cost a premium as compared to 255 tire
because<00:06:13.620> this<00:06:14.580> is<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.789> smaller<00:06:15.150> tire<00:06:15.479> so<00:06:16.229> this

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
because this is a smaller tire so this

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.430 
because this is a smaller tire so this
ty<00:06:16.680> can<00:06:16.979> handle<00:06:17.310> more<00:06:17.490> way<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:19.050> that's<00:06:19.289> what

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
ty can handle more way and that's what

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.250 
ty can handle more way and that's what
they<00:06:19.590> usually<00:06:19.710> put<00:06:20.130> on<00:06:20.279> heavy<00:06:20.520> haul<00:06:20.820> like

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
they usually put on heavy haul like

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.620 
they usually put on heavy haul like
55-ton<00:06:22.260> trailers<00:06:22.740> so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
55-ton trailers so

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.570 
55-ton trailers so
as<00:06:25.140> you<00:06:25.380> see<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:25.710> by<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:25.950> way<00:06:26.040> this<00:06:26.250> collar

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
as you see this by the way this collar

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.210 
as you see this by the way this collar
means<00:06:26.940> that<00:06:27.240> when<00:06:28.230> you<00:06:28.350> see<00:06:28.500> that<00:06:28.650> kind<00:06:29.100> of

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
means that when you see that kind of

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.730 
means that when you see that kind of
like<00:06:29.460> yellow<00:06:30.000> color<00:06:30.270> that<00:06:30.480> means<00:06:30.690> that<00:06:30.870> that

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
like yellow color that means that that

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.480 
like yellow color that means that that
trailer<00:06:32.070> wins<00:06:32.400> so<00:06:32.670> here<00:06:32.910> was<00:06:33.120> 1<00:06:33.330> 10<00:06:33.950> 100<00:06:34.950> k

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
trailer wins so here was 1 10 100 k

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.150 
trailer wins so here was 1 10 100 k
pounds<00:06:36.030> versus<00:06:36.530> 100,000<00:06:37.530> right<00:06:37.680> so<00:06:37.830> this<00:06:37.980> one

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
pounds versus 100,000 right so this one

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.660 
pounds versus 100,000 right so this one
wins<00:06:38.400> then<00:06:38.730> here<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.810> steel<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.260> better<00:06:40.670> than

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
wins then here the steel is better than

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.580 
wins then here the steel is better than
here<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.240> swing<00:06:42.510> radius<00:06:42.720> is<00:06:43.050> slightly<00:06:43.290> better

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
here the swing radius is slightly better

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.950 
here the swing radius is slightly better
the<00:06:43.860> wood<00:06:44.040> is<00:06:44.220> better<00:06:44.460> but<00:06:44.880> here<00:06:45.510> you<00:06:45.630> got<00:06:45.810> the

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
the wood is better but here you got the

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.700 
the wood is better but here you got the
deck<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.590> axle<00:06:47.070> that<00:06:47.310> tires<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:49.080> check<00:06:49.560> this
