00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.310
 hello today we are going to make a 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.860
 super simple strapless blouse for this 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.730
 we're going to need half a meter to three 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.150
 quarters of any league that has any 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.440
 appearance already stamped some metallic 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.600
 in this case it has sequins 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.949
 we will also need a thread of 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.949
 color tape measure and sheets to scratch 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.990
 The first thing we are going to do is to fold 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 our fabric in half 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.860
 and again we fold it in half 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.290
 so that we fit our fourth of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.900
 I taste fourth taste I have 22 and 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.820
 half here, I'm perfectly happy 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's mark the length of the rose 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.939
 and long I have 42 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.140
 and we make a rectangle of 42 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.649
 by our taste account 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.619
 that would be 22 and a half do not go do not go 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.619
 to leave margins of seams 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.290
 here is my good box here already 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 we have our rectangle the length of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.440
 the blouse that are 42 by the fourth of 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.369
 bust that are 22 and a half we are going to take 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.369
 half 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.440
 21 and here in these 21 we are going to put 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.310
 two centimeters this is to give 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 more curve in the part of the back and what 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.600
 fades moss to the banks is nothing more 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.240
 a small curve that we are 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.240
 getting in for our back 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.630
 tHE PIECES 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.670
 and this would be the back we 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.840
 let's go down 3 centimeters and we 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.849
 let's fade this is to give it a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.849
 small neckline in the part 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is this that is the most lowered 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.090
 part of the back 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.690
 and this would be our forward now what 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.360
 what we are going to do is sew with a 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.050
 centimeter of seam allowance in the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.050
 sides 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.319
 we already have our Russian army here 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.569
 when you have to measure us if we 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.329
 it's a bit loose or a little bit more 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.890
 adjusted if we want it more at the waist what 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.260
 only we are going to do in height of 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 We are going to put him here from the waist 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.040
 about two to four centimeters 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.860
 depending how tight they want it 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.799
 of the waist part in this case 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.510
 oven very well already we have it ready not 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.700
 let's move on or see the work is the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.799
 finishing that we do to our 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.799
 garments by our seam joints 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.690
 in this case not for the sequins already 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.060
 that the sequins make us break 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.310
 we do not occupy the fabric anyway 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.500
 that our garment does not fray 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.070
 and now what we are going to do is the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.920
 hem 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.920
 for this we are going to do double 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.919
 and doubles 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.960
 we are going to do this in the part 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.389
 from below as in the top 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.440
 take into account when sewing 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.270
 the letters to pull the fabric very well 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.310
 the time we are sewing will be 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.470
 pulling this is so that at the time of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.680
 Do not break the thread if we 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.360
 we let it cook like this without pulling the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.610
 attention of the thread at the time of putting us 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.460
 our garment is going to stretch and it's going 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.570
 to break then you have to sew and pull 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.570
 a little bit our 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.879
 Here we already got our blouse ready 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.099
 you have to remove all the threads very well 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.099
 that we do not have any thread 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:38.649
 and the back is fixed we were left with a 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:41.169
 little more low-cut here is already ready 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:43.059
 before ironing the one that creeps in a 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.789
 piece with a piece of cloth from which 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:48.009
 He left us to see the back side to 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.849
 see if nothing happens to the sequins or 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:56.340
 well putting a rag on it and here 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.410
