so a really good example is how you go
from<00:03:12.370> hey<00:03:13.120> can<00:03:13.330> go<00:03:13.450> from<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.750> liter<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.350> shooting

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
from hey can go from a liter to shooting

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.530 
from hey can go from a liter to shooting
is<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.670> you've<00:03:15.820> got<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> guy<00:03:16.090> staying<00:03:16.420> behind

tests hands-on throughout development

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.610 
tests hands-on throughout development
just<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.510> try<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.690> hone<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.050> mechanics<00:04:11.470> to

just to try and hone the mechanics to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.930 
just to try and hone the mechanics to
get<00:04:11.710> them<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:11.860> tight<00:04:12.070> as<00:04:12.220> they<00:04:12.340> can<00:04:12.490> be<00:04:12.610> as<00:04:12.760> fun

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
get them as tight as they can be as fun

as<00:04:13.030> they<00:04:13.120> can<00:04:13.300> be<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.260> kind<00:04:14.440> of<00:04:14.470> caps<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
as they can be so this kind of caps it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.300 
as they can be so this kind of caps it
all<00:04:14.950> off<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.910> know<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.090> see

all off you know to see

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.710 
all off you know to see
at<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.699> stage<00:04:18.939> and<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.269> putting<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.509> kind<00:04:19.659> of

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
at this stage and I putting the kind of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.849 
at this stage and I putting the kind of
consumer<00:04:20.019> demo<00:04:20.199> in<00:04:20.289> people's<00:04:20.560> hands<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
consumer demo in people's hands and

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.990 
consumer demo in people's hands and
seeing<00:04:21.069> how<00:04:21.159> the<00:04:21.220> response<00:04:21.579> oh<00:04:21.729> yeah<00:04:21.849> it's<00:04:21.970> a

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
seeing how the response oh yeah it's a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.330 
seeing how the response oh yeah it's a
great<00:04:22.120> kind<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.830> ends<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.009> the<00:04:24.159> to<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
great kind of ends to the to the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.779 
great kind of ends to the to the
project's<00:04:24.729> almost<00:04:25.030> end<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:26.580> think<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.669> thing

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
project's almost end I think the thing

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.040 
project's almost end I think the thing
that<00:04:27.849> might<00:04:28.060> make<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.389> stick<00:04:28.569> out<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:28.750> most<00:04:28.900> of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
that might make it stick out the most of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.409 
that might make it stick out the most of
me<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.319> story<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.550> thing<00:04:31.210> there's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
me is the story like a thing there's

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.550 
me is the story like a thing there's
it's<00:04:31.569> very<00:04:31.750> rare<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:31.960> like<00:04:32.229> there's<00:04:32.409> been<00:04:32.500> a

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
it's very rare that like there's been a

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.080 
it's very rare that like there's been a
lot<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.740> attempts<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.430> kind<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.669> do<00:04:33.789> this<00:04:33.969> or

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
lot of attempts to kind of do this or

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.179 
lot of attempts to kind of do this or
the<00:04:34.270> true<00:04:34.479> crime<00:04:34.870> story<00:04:35.379> but<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> think<00:04:36.129> they

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
the true crime story but I think they

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.679 
the true crime story but I think they
might<00:04:36.370> have<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.879> kind<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.419> winning

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
might have like kind of the winning

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.320 
might have like kind of the winning
formula<00:04:37.870> irie<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.069> combat<00:04:39.400> system<00:04:39.550> it's

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
formula irie like the combat system it's

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.510 
formula irie like the combat system it's
not<00:04:40.449> like<00:04:40.629> a<00:04:40.659> traditional<00:04:41.349> shooter<00:04:42.129> as<00:04:42.340> you'd

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
not like a traditional shooter as you'd

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.459 
not like a traditional shooter as you'd
expect<00:04:42.610> from<00:04:42.879> over<00:04:43.150> more<00:04:43.300> game<00:04:43.509> they<00:04:43.960> kind<00:04:44.409> of

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:44.469 
expect from over more game they kind of

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.200 
expect from over more game they kind of
tend<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.919> tend<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.370> be<00:04:45.460> together<00:04:45.580> it's<00:04:45.939> a<00:04:46.000> free

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
tend to tend to be together it's a free

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.790 
tend to tend to be together it's a free
flow<00:04:46.389> system<00:04:46.750> similar<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.199> Batman<00:04:47.590> series

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
flow system similar to the Batman series

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.999 
flow system similar to the Batman series
and<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:49.210> yeah<00:04:49.419> lots<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.930> contextual<00:04:50.830> moves

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
and so yeah lots of contextual moves

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.029 
and so yeah lots of contextual moves
against<00:04:51.430> environments<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.840> offers<00:04:53.199> a<00:04:53.560> lot<00:04:53.800> of

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
against environments it offers a lot of

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.189 
against environments it offers a lot of
different<00:04:54.069> kinds<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.699> combat<00:04:55.629> and<00:04:55.780> driving

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
got its got a really edge to it which is

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.580 
got its got a really edge to it which is
really<00:05:04.180> impressive<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.229> that's<00:05:05.409> what<00:05:05.530> you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
really impressive and that's what you

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.899 
really impressive and that's what you
want<00:05:05.740> from<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.919> game<00:05:06.069> I<00:05:06.219> think<00:05:06.520> most<00:05:06.729> of<00:05:06.819> a

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
want from the game I think most of a

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.269 
want from the game I think most of a
combat<00:05:07.270> seems<00:05:07.479> to<00:05:07.629> stuck<00:05:07.870> out<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.289> most<00:05:08.319> it's

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
combat seems to stuck out the most it's

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.360 
combat seems to stuck out the most it's
quite<00:05:09.430> free<00:05:09.669> flowing<00:05:09.940> like<00:05:10.349> arkham<00:05:11.349> city<00:05:11.560> but

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
quite free flowing like arkham city but

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.550 
quite free flowing like arkham city but
it's<00:05:12.610> got<00:05:12.819> these<00:05:13.000> quite<00:05:13.389> visible<00:05:13.750> finishing

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
it's got these quite visible finishing

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.769 
it's got these quite visible finishing
moves<00:05:14.770> which<00:05:15.189> kind<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> provide<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.659> nice

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
moves which kind of provide a nice

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.769 
moves which kind of provide a nice
closure<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.740> hear<00:05:17.919> fighting<00:05:18.400> I'd<00:05:19.389> like<00:05:19.750> to
