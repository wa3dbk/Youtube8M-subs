00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.480 
alright the main thing about this game
is<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.120> there's<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.230> lot<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.190> different

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
is that there's a lot of different

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.820 
is that there's a lot of different
levels<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> awesome

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.320 

overall<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.189> probably<00:00:23.460> did<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.850> game<00:00:24.090> about

three<00:00:24.570> star<00:00:24.810> reading<00:00:25.460> simply<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:27.560> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
three star reading simply because the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.930 
three star reading simply because the
bonus<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.490> horrible<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.610> bonus

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
time and it does that I think it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
time and it does that I think it
switches<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.700> every<00:01:14.970> week<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.509> month<00:01:15.720> or

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
switches it like every week or month or

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
switches it like every week or month or
something<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.680> couldn't<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.610> been<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.729> long

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
something I couldn't have been that long
though<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.600> haven't<00:01:18.750> had<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> app

though because I haven't had the app

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.890 
though because I haven't had the app
that<00:01:19.740> long<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> every

on<00:03:21.730> too

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.140 

I<00:03:29.629> do<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.469> that<00:03:30.500> they<00:03:30.829> have<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.400> skill<00:03:31.849> stop

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.929 

a<00:03:45.439> graphic<00:03:46.439> why's<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:47.099> seems<00:03:47.370> pretty<00:03:47.610> good

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
a graphic why's this seems pretty good

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.160 
a graphic why's this seems pretty good
but<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.659> is<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.049> bonus<00:03:49.260> now<00:03:50.840> on<00:03:51.840> here

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
but this is the bonus now on here

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.899 
but this is the bonus now on here
basically<00:03:52.349> you<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.769> drop<00:03:52.980> balls<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.640> they

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
basically you just drop balls and they

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.479 
basically you just drop balls and they
bounce<00:03:54.239> off<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.689> pecs<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.829> problem<00:03:56.159> is<00:03:56.280> when

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
bounce off the pecs the problem is when

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.099 
bounce off the pecs the problem is when
you<00:03:56.609> get<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.879> other<00:03:57.030> levels<00:03:57.480> they<00:03:57.659> have<00:03:57.689> things

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
you get to other levels they have things

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.690 
you get to other levels they have things
blocking<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.450> entrance<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.340> makes<00:04:02.579> it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
blocking the entrance is so it makes it

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.550 
blocking the entrance is so it makes it
harder<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.090> get<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> bonus<00:04:03.810> where<00:04:04.349> it's

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
harder to get a bonus where it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.770 
harder to get a bonus where it's
actually<00:04:04.680> supposed<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.459> easy<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:06.299> get<00:04:06.569> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
actually supposed to be easy to get the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.770 
actually supposed to be easy to get the
bonus<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.099> most<00:04:08.609> most<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.180> games<00:04:09.480> have

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
bonus and most most of the games have

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.229 
bonus and most most of the games have
the<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.650> basically<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.549> lucky<00:04:12.030> pick

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
anymore simply because it bores me

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.189 
anymore simply because it bores me
