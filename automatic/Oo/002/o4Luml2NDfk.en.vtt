00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.360
 I like you I am sure I have 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.520
 a problem that periodically occurs 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 you boil milk in the kitchen 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.020
 carefully you want her not to run away 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.780
 but it only takes a moment to escape 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 how does the milk disaster from 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.020
 pans 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 on the stove everything burned a bunch of work in 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.119
 Generally no pleasure to solve this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.140
 and many other problems in the kitchen to me 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.179
 will help my friend 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 expert taras pen he is a jack of all trades 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.690
 Greetings and live again 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 let's get down to really really 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.390
 The problem seems to be not significant but 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 many very consequences I want time and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.039
 learn forever will make me 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 the milk didn't run away as I tell for 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.309
 start you need to take the pot pour out 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.729
 pretty milk so we turn on our 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.039
 slab 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.940
 which we prepared so yes it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.650
 instantly heated with you we will 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 look to not like milk, we do not 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 we will meditate on it now we take 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.890
 tricky device is such a brand 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.469
 im cooking oil i use for 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.380
 to smear the edges of the pot after 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.180
 this procedure milk you will see 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 avoid we won't really 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 The principle is very simple . 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.829
 rules of lubrication if in plain language 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 explain as if milk 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.060
 slip and does not rise above here 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.350
 that 's what a man calls simple 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.030
 ok language carefully 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 up the saucepans and its edges 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.159
 temperature should be minimal i 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 here because if you make a big 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.740
 fire milk will escape anyway and so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.109
 nach milk in the process and I have to you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 practical proposal was that here 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.219
 you try to add beautiful 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.740
 ingredients in the soup in order to please 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.829
 near and dear 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 went too far in the soup 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.819
 salty and all essentially spoiled eat 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.679
 its impossible such cases we are girls 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.350
 we say that we probably fell in love again 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.810
 but I agree you have a recipe like 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.660
 Of course there are still some munchkin methods. 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.790
 the simplest gauze we take poison and with 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.440
 help to start here or flour or 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.330
 cereals we could get rid of 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.220
 repot that choose well come on 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.650
 try rice you can ask you to take 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.170
 a handful of rice and fill it in the middle 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.239
 points we pour more you can still take 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.550
 at home you will be moved in two 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.310
 cards so get good 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 so in our pot which is essentially 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 shield boiling we dip the prize with gauze 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.260
 directly into the saucepan like this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.390
 once and for three minutes in a boiling state 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.220
 we leave that is with flour that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.080
 same effect that with rice i correct it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.780
 pulls itself into excess salt and we 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.000
 get the soup with the right ambassador will 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.650
 everyone was given three minutes just take out 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.540
 take out and put here on a saucer 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.610
 and the taste of norris does not appear after 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.590
 such a procedure you know he can only 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.560
 elevate the taste and in no case his 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.810
 do not spoil and if the flour 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
 the same gauze doesn't skip a beat 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 torment directly with this will not be 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.870
 no problem with this method 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.420
 say adopted something else if not suddenly 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.690
 managed there is still let's say this problem 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.510
 take a spoon take sugar add you add 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.170
 no sugar look what i do i am smooth 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.120
 I omit the soup and until the moment until sugar 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.799
 will start to dissolve we keep it in 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.470
 soup yes he absorbs himself salt 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.160
 take out and have a little dish if not enough 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.170
 still 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.500
 powerful as long as it is after each 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.920
 lumps of sugar to taste soup and 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 sugar is left to soup only before 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.209
 the moment when it starts to dissolve 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.510
 that is, he should not give you 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.209
 we then sugar in fact soup and here 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.790
 there and here if this did not help or 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.799
 rice and suddenly no flour at hand sugar 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 including take big potato in 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.420
 we already have potatoes in the soup 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.130
 problem we brought then it is needed 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.290
 just to remove this one 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.819
 maximum salinity of our soup on 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.880
 in fact each of the methods is very 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.290
 effective and yes 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.850
 it's easy to check at home and turn 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.650
 attention milk quietly begins 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.420
 pat and nor does she go beyond 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.120
 the boundaries of our pan until she came out 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.040
 from the coast, we recall what methods to do 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.709
 soup less salty and today mastered 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.260
 thanks to that help and so gauze to us 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.270
 need rice or flour all this is wrapped 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.790
 Marlechka we lower three minutes we get 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.160
 get the desired result or is it 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.140
 the first or here is such a potato 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.490
 which we throw entirely on 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.100
 three or four minutes we reach 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.100
 if suddenly you have no potatoes there and she 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.500
 won't ruin your total dishes at the end we 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.350
 can utami leave anya well and sugar 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.660
 saharok neatly on teaspoon 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.180
 lowered until the moment of dissolution we are not 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.340
 we sugar the soup we absorb the excess salt 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.020
 great another interesting point is 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.670
 relates directly to the vegetable 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.760
 oils happened such that for example for meat 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.100
 in French, rub on top of shirts 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.320
 yes and often happens that cheese sticks to 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.440
 grater and it turns uncomfortable hard to wash 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.480
 then we take the same one too 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.460
 so here not to get hurt yes yes I am 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.930
 I watch oil almost everything is possible on 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.270
 kitchen fix but i like when 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.580
 man works on claws yes listen well 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.530
 the effect you promised is immediately visible 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.480
 There are practically slip Madrid 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.220
 beautifully mentally showered and nothing 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.470
 stuck erased everything and there will be a wash 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.490
 incredibly easy I liked this one 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.470
 advice 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.780
 back to our milk it 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.270
 practically here already boiled 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.370
 low temperature a little more 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.680
 time than usual but without 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.750
 transfusions without these cleanups here 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.810
 plates that so spoil the mood 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.449
 takes a lot of time I remind you that we 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.849
 just smeared the edges of vegetable oil 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.039
 pots before you boil a little like 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.810
 great what exactly man helps us 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.110
