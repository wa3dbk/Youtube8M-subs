very useful as time goes by and they

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
+3 that's rare no I'm but this is just a

+3 that's rare no I'm but this is just a
basic<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.100> lets<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> channel<00:01:35.820> one

more it doesn't seem like that big of a
deal<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.610> something<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.360> enjoyed

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
deal but it's something I really enjoyed

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.289 
deal but it's something I really enjoyed
because<00:01:39.869> getting<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> extra<00:01:40.890> mana

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
very first turn of the game so let's say

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
very first turn of the game so let's say
a<00:01:46.470> game<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> 10<00:01:47.189> turns<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.729> 10<00:01:48.060> extra<00:01:48.420> mana

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
a game is 10 turns that's 10 extra mana

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
a game is 10 turns that's 10 extra mana
that<00:01:48.810> you've<00:01:48.930> done<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.130> goes

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that you've done or if the game goes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
that you've done or if the game goes
longer<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.899> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
longer than that this really can can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.219 
longer than that this really can can
build<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.670> enjoy<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> same

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
build up so I enjoy this and at the same

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
build up so I enjoy this and at the same
time<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.369> annoying<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> your

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
time it's not so annoying to your

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.340 
time it's not so annoying to your
opponent<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.299> they'll<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.630> after<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.200> with

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
opponent that they'll go after it with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
opponent that they'll go after it with
dissolve<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.369> another<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.450> kind

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
dissolve and another thing so it's kind

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.179 
dissolve and another thing so it's kind
of<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.049> nor<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.070> will

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
probably hurt them in the end a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.100 
probably hurt them in the end a
different<00:02:05.250> amulet<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.360> number<00:02:06.509> 9<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.079> the

one<00:02:10.800> life<00:02:11.069> every<00:02:11.459> turn<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
one life every turn now this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.710 
one life every turn now this
debate<00:02:13.430> between<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> equipment

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
debate between this and the equipment

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.809 
debate between this and the equipment
that<00:02:14.750> lets<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.080> regenerate<00:02:15.410> too<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.640> is

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
that lets you regenerate too but this is

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.550 
that lets you regenerate too but this is
during<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.090> upkeep<00:02:17.690> phase<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.379> this

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
during the upkeep phase and so this

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.500 
during the upkeep phase and so this
sometimes<00:02:19.099> just<00:02:19.610> lets<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.209> hang<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.480> there

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
sometimes just lets you hang in there

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.080 
sometimes just lets you hang in there
and<00:02:20.840> again<00:02:21.200> your<00:02:22.040> opponent<00:02:22.519> looks<00:02:22.730> at<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and again your opponent looks at it and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.990 
and again your opponent looks at it and
says<00:02:23.300> not<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.440> big<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.920> deal<00:02:25.129> but<00:02:25.819> you're

unless<00:03:45.109> they're<00:03:45.410> using<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> lot<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.829> elemental

stuff which is something that happens

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.500

more<00:03:48.109> often<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:48.799> in<00:03:49.040> mage<00:03:49.639> wars<00:03:49.880> games<00:03:50.239> this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
more often now in mage wars games this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.199 
more often now in mage wars games this
one<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.840> -<00:03:51.109> 2<00:03:51.260> -<00:03:51.380> flame<00:03:51.650> frost<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.880> lightning

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
one is - 2 - flame frost and lightning

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.879 
one is - 2 - flame frost and lightning
now<00:03:53.299> frost<00:03:53.690> isn't<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.200> game<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.680> much

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
now frost isn't in the game that much

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.140 
now frost isn't in the game that much
I'm<00:03:55.040> assuming<00:03:55.400> we'll<00:03:55.549> see<00:03:55.730> more<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.030> in

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
I'm assuming we'll see more of that in

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.210 
I'm assuming we'll see more of that in
the<00:03:56.299> future<00:03:56.630> but<00:03:57.349> then<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.620> also<00:03:57.769> gives<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.099> an

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the future but then it also gives you an

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.309 
the future but then it also gives you an
armor<00:03:58.489> pulse<00:03:58.790> one<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.299> top<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.780> so

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
armor pulse one on top of that so

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.110 
armor pulse one on top of that so
against<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.889> annoying<00:04:01.220> flame<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:01.790> lightning

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
against the annoying flame and lightning

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.830 
against the annoying flame and lightning
attacks<00:04:02.450> great<00:04:03.200> defense<00:04:04.090> globes<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.239> skill<00:04:05.569> I

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
attacks great defense globes of skill I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.020 
attacks great defense globes of skill I
just<00:04:06.500> like<00:04:06.739> anything<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.430> lets<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:07.760> do<00:04:08.000> a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
just like anything that lets you do a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.080 
just like anything that lets you do a
reroll<00:04:08.930> this<00:04:09.530> gives<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.040> reroll<00:04:10.700> for

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
to cast pillar of light all the time I

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.170 
to cast pillar of light all the time I
can<00:05:50.139> attach<00:05:50.409> that<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:51.129> keep<00:05:51.639> using<00:05:51.879> it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
can attach that to it and keep using it

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.059 
can attach that to it and keep using it
over<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.750> over<00:05:52.930> again<00:05:53.139> and<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.529> can<00:05:53.740> change

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
over and over again and you can change

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.640 
over and over again and you can change
it<00:05:54.310> but<00:05:54.759> this<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.569> know<00:05:55.689> a<00:05:55.719> basic<00:05:56.080> one<00:05:56.500> in

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
it but this is you know a basic one in

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.439 
it but this is you know a basic one in
minutes<00:05:56.889> it's<00:05:57.069> great<00:05:57.550> artwork<00:05:57.939> for<00:05:58.120> this<00:05:58.240> too

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
minutes it's great artwork for this too

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.290 
minutes it's great artwork for this too
but<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.050> allows<00:05:59.379> you<00:05:59.740> to<00:06:00.250> continue<00:06:00.759> to<00:06:00.879> use<00:06:00.909> the

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
but it allows you to continue to use the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.600 
but it allows you to continue to use the
spell<00:06:01.539> over<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.080> over<00:06:02.319> again<00:06:02.439> so<00:06:02.800> maybe<00:06:03.339> you

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
spell over and over again so maybe you

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.369 
spell over and over again so maybe you
are<00:06:03.669> gonna<00:06:04.000> just<00:06:04.210> keep<00:06:04.419> using<00:06:04.599> fireballs<00:06:05.199> or

you better have an elemental one my
favorite<00:06:09.490> weapon<00:06:09.610> though<00:06:09.909> is<00:06:10.089> one<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.539> the

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
favorite weapon though is one that the

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.029 
favorite weapon though is one that the
force<00:06:10.960> master<00:06:11.289> can<00:06:11.560> use<00:06:11.680> well<00:06:11.860> anybody

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
force master can use well anybody

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.829 
force master can use well anybody
anybody<00:06:12.729> can<00:06:13.089> use<00:06:13.120> it<00:06:13.300> but<00:06:13.539> this<00:06:13.689> is

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
anybody can use it but this is

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.050 
anybody can use it but this is
definitely<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.229> Force<00:06:14.469> Master<00:06:14.919> weapon<00:06:15.279> its

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
definitely a Force Master weapon its

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.420 
definitely a Force Master weapon its
autonomous<00:06:16.930> which<00:06:17.169> means<00:06:17.439> it<00:06:17.830> can<00:06:17.979> attack<00:06:18.250> on

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
autonomous which means it can attack on

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.980 
autonomous which means it can attack on
its<00:06:18.580> own<00:06:18.729> so<00:06:18.879> you<00:06:18.909> can<00:06:19.000> do<00:06:19.270> something<00:06:19.509> else<00:06:19.719> and

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
its own so you can do something else and

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.350 
its own so you can do something else and
then<00:06:20.409> the<00:06:20.560> sword<00:06:20.800> will<00:06:21.009> attack<00:06:21.250> or<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:22.089> can

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
then the sword will attack or it can

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.200 
then the sword will attack or it can
defend<00:06:22.750> you<00:06:22.990> once<00:06:23.490> not<00:06:24.490> against<00:06:24.849> range<00:06:25.060> of

defend you once not against range of

which<00:06:27.460> isn't<00:06:27.729> as<00:06:27.819> good<00:06:28.029> but<00:06:28.539> still<00:06:28.689> the<00:06:28.960> fact

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
which isn't as good but still the fact

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.360 
which isn't as good but still the fact
