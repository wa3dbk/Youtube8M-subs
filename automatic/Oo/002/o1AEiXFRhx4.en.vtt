hey guys as a Matt from Jack as my
co-pilot<00:00:09.840> today<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> Air<00:00:11.099> Hogs<00:00:11.370> hyper

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
co-pilot today I have the Air Hogs hyper

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.629 
co-pilot today I have the Air Hogs hyper
tracks<00:00:12.450> I've<00:00:13.410> been<00:00:13.679> really<00:00:14.009> excited<00:00:14.190> about

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
tracks I've been really excited about

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.070 
tracks I've been really excited about
this<00:00:14.820> thing<00:00:15.030> ever<00:00:15.360> since<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.870> announced

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this thing ever since it was announced

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.189 
this thing ever since it was announced
this<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> 2.4<00:00:17.520> gigahertz<00:00:18.199> all-terrain

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
this is a 2.4 gigahertz all-terrain

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.519 
this is a 2.4 gigahertz all-terrain
vehicle<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:20.970> nice<00:00:21.510> big<00:00:21.810> rubber<00:00:22.109> tracks

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
vehicle it's got nice big rubber tracks

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.460 
vehicle it's got nice big rubber tracks
and<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.310> low<00:00:23.640> profile<00:00:24.119> body<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:25.050> allows<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and a low profile body which allows it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.019 
and a low profile body which allows it
to<00:00:25.500> drive<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.580> either<00:00:27.480> side<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.820> let's<00:00:29.820> check

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to drive on either side so let's check

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.610 
to drive on either side so let's check
it<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:31.040> ok<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:33.350> he's<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.500> these

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it out ok so here it is he's got these

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060 
it out ok so here it is he's got these
huge<00:00:34.829> teeth<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.880> tracks<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:37.070> which

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
huge teeth on the tracks here which

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.260 
huge teeth on the tracks here which
gives<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.520> good<00:00:38.700> traction<00:00:39.000> they're

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
gives you really good traction they're

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.190 
gives you really good traction they're
nice<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.420> soft

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
nice and soft

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
nice and soft
I<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> same<00:00:41.460> before<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
I like the same before it's got a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.470 
I like the same before it's got a
low-profile<00:00:42.930> body<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> body's<00:00:45.300> always

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
low-profile body so that body's always

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020 
low-profile body so that body's always
under<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> track<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.980> can't<00:00:47.730> drive<00:00:47.940> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
under the track so it can can't drive on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060 
under the track so it can can't drive on
either<00:00:48.210> side<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.379> first<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.950> I'll

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
either side but my first got this I'll

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.459 
either side but my first got this I'll
sink<00:00:50.340> India<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.140> reason<00:00:52.440> for

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
sink India you know that the reason for

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.889 
sink India you know that the reason for
this<00:00:52.649> big<00:00:52.860> wheel<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.280> front<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.420> gives<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this big wheel up front is it gives you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.220 
this big wheel up front is it gives you
this<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:55.920> traction<00:00:56.539> as<00:00:57.539> soon<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> hit

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this much traction as soon as you hit

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.090 
this much traction as soon as you hit
something<00:00:58.969> if<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> climb<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.100> if

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
something if you're going to climb it if

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
something if you're going to climb it if
you<00:01:02.370> were<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> climb<00:01:02.879> something<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you were going to climb something on

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.260 
you were going to climb something on
this<00:01:03.960> side<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.270> looks

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this side you know you don't have looks

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
this side you know you don't have looks
like<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.570> 2<00:01:06.869> teeth<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> traction<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.850> help

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
like about 2 teeth of traction to help

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
like about 2 teeth of traction to help
pick<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> whole<00:01:09.570> car<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.520> have

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
pick this whole car up but here you have

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
pick this whole car up but here you have
looks<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.540> four<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> things<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
looks like four so one of the things I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
looks like four so one of the things I
was<00:01:14.820> thinking<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.830> you're

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
was thinking is it you know when you're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
was thinking is it you know when you're
driving<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> great<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.689> big

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
driving this is great to have these big

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
driving this is great to have these big
wheels<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.380> climb<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> flip<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
wheels to climb but if you flip over I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
wheels to climb but if you flip over I
mean<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> pointless

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
mean it would be you kind of pointless

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
mean it would be you kind of pointless
it<00:01:24.240> wouldn't<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.140> wouldn't<00:01:25.320> climb<00:01:25.530> nearly<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it wouldn't it wouldn't climb nearly as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
it wouldn't it wouldn't climb nearly as
well<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:28.220> extremely<00:01:29.220> surprised<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
well so I was extremely surprised when I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.249 
well so I was extremely surprised when I
flip<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.650> over<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.600> changed

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
flip this over and it actually changed

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
flip this over and it actually changed
directions<00:01:35.360> no<00:01:36.360> matter<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.750> side<00:01:38.030> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
directions no matter which side the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
directions no matter which side the
hyper<00:01:39.210> tracks<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.259> always<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
hyper tracks is on it's always going to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.050 
hyper tracks is on it's always going to
go<00:01:41.899> with<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> big<00:01:43.200> side<00:01:43.439> forward<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
go with the big side forward and I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
go with the big side forward and I
thought<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.600> awesome<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.530> way

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
thought that was awesome and the way

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
thought that was awesome and the way
that<00:01:46.829> works<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:48.479> got<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:50.329> infrared

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that works this got a infrared

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.940 
that works this got a infrared
transmitter<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.140> an<00:01:52.290> infrared<00:01:52.649> receiver

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
transmitter and an infrared receiver

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
transmitter and an infrared receiver
right<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.740> cool<00:01:56.040> design<00:01:57.290> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
right there it's a pretty cool design so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
right there it's a pretty cool design so
if<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> sides<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:59.100> the<00:02:00.770> signal<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
if that sides down the signal is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.179 
if that sides down the signal is
bouncing<00:02:02.640> off<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.540> floor<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.950> being

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
bouncing off the floor and it's being

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.660 
bouncing off the floor and it's being
received<00:02:05.549> by<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.680> sensor<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
received by that sensor right there and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.660 
received by that sensor right there and
when<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.179> facing<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.979> signal<00:02:10.979> Deschutes<00:02:11.459> up

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
when it's facing up signal Deschutes up

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.150 
when it's facing up signal Deschutes up
and<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.000> never<00:02:12.209> reflected<00:02:13.170> off

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
and it's never reflected off

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.530 
and it's never reflected off
so<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> knows<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.440> side<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.680> up

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so it knows that now this side is up

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.450 
so it knows that now this side is up
it<00:02:18.540> also<00:02:18.660> has<00:02:19.490> independent<00:02:20.490> suspension<00:02:22.460> which

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
it also has independent suspension which

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.370 
it also has independent suspension which
is<00:02:23.490> really<00:02:24.120> good<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:24.450> you're<00:02:24.600> over<00:02:25.080> super

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
is really good when you're over super

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.430 
is really good when you're over super
rough<00:02:25.560> terrain<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.070> rocks<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.090> something

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
rough terrain like rocks or something

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.460 
rough terrain like rocks or something
it'll<00:02:28.440> allow<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:29.160> track<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.990> always<00:02:31.170> stay<00:02:31.350> on

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
it'll allow one track to always stay on

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.980 
it'll allow one track to always stay on
the<00:02:31.560> ground<00:02:31.790> even<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.630> other<00:02:33.660> ones

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the ground even when the other ones

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.360 
the ground even when the other ones
climbing<00:02:34.380> over<00:02:34.590> something<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:39.710> had<00:02:40.710> really

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
climbing over something I had really

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.960 
climbing over something I had really
good<00:02:41.520> success<00:02:41.760> with<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.360> thing<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.790> able

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
good success with this thing it was able

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.730 
good success with this thing it was able
to<00:02:45.030> drive<00:02:45.480> over<00:02:45.630> mulch<00:02:46.050> rocks<00:02:46.730> obviously<00:02:48.740> dirt

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
to drive over mulch rocks obviously dirt

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.760 
to drive over mulch rocks obviously dirt
but<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.670> even<00:02:51.330> drove<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.380> around<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
but I even drove this around in the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.850 
but I even drove this around in the
grass<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:54.930> winter<00:02:55.110> time<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.740> it's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
grass and it's winter time here so it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.710 
grass and it's winter time here so it's
not<00:02:56.040> growing<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.459> haven't<00:02:56.730> cut<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.570> while

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
not growing we haven't cut it in a while

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.770 
not growing we haven't cut it in a while
so<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:59.130> was<00:02:59.250> pretty<00:02:59.459> thick<00:02:59.700> grass<00:03:00.000> there

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
so it's it was pretty thick grass there

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780 
so it's it was pretty thick grass there
were<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> couple<00:03:01.020> times<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:02.520> would<00:03:02.610> get

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
were a couple times when it would get

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.580 
were a couple times when it would get
stuck<00:03:03.150> both<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> rocks<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> grass

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
stuck both in the rocks and in the grass

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.380 
stuck both in the rocks and in the grass
but<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:08.130> turning<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.730> back<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.060> forth<00:03:09.240> it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
but just turning going back and forth it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.210 
but just turning going back and forth it
was<00:03:09.450> actually<00:03:09.840> able<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.380> work<00:03:10.470> itself<00:03:11.010> out

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
was actually able to work itself out

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.160 
was actually able to work itself out
every<00:03:11.610> time<00:03:11.790> which<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.840> thought<00:03:12.990> was<00:03:13.110> really

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
every time which I thought was really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.699 
every time which I thought was really
cool<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.330> turn<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:16.110> no<00:03:16.320> forward

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
cool this can turn with with no forward

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.870 
cool this can turn with with no forward
motion

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
motion

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.759 
motion
you<00:03:18.630> know<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> tracks<00:03:19.140> move<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.440> opposite

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you know the tracks move in opposite

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.590 
you know the tracks move in opposite
directions<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.550> what<00:03:20.730> causes<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
directions and that's what causes the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.500 
directions and that's what causes the
turn<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> even<00:03:23.489> without<00:03:23.550> moving<00:03:24.090> forward<00:03:24.420> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
turn so even without moving forward you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.650 
turn so even without moving forward you
can<00:03:24.690> turn<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.890> also<00:03:26.100> turned<00:03:26.580> while<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
can turn and it also turned while you

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.229 
can turn and it also turned while you
are<00:03:27.810> moving<00:03:28.200> forward<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.940> give<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.150> an

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
are moving forward just to give you an

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.670 
are moving forward just to give you an
idea<00:03:30.360> of<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.690> scale<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
idea of the scale here I have the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.000 
idea of the scale here I have the
hyperactive<00:03:32.640> x'<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.300> hyperactive<00:03:33.900> stunt<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
hyperactive x' the hyperactive stunt the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.460 
hyperactive x' the hyperactive stunt the
hyperactive<00:03:35.400> 5<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.870> obviously<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> hyper

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
hyperactive 5 and obviously the hyper

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.000 
hyperactive 5 and obviously the hyper
tracks<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.700> hyper<00:03:38.910> tracks<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.239> almost

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
tracks and the hyper tracks is almost

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.140 
tracks and the hyper tracks is almost
exactly<00:03:42.350> if<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:43.800> exactly<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.910> same

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
exactly if not it is exactly the same

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.030 
exactly if not it is exactly the same
length<00:03:45.390> as<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:46.440> hyperactive<00:03:47.400> x'<00:03:47.730> 5<00:03:49.040> actually

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
length as the hyperactive x' 5 actually

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.460 
length as the hyperactive x' 5 actually
about<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.340> same<00:03:50.550> weight<00:03:51.920> obviously<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.820> I

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
about the same weight obviously the I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.280 
about the same weight obviously the I
practice<00:03:55.470> 5<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.980> taller<00:03:58.519> but<00:04:00.140> let's<00:04:01.140> look<00:04:01.200> at

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
practice 5 is taller but let's look at

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.270 
practice 5 is taller but let's look at
the<00:04:01.380> radio<00:04:02.570> alright<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.720> here's<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> radio

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the radio alright so here's the radio

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.220 
the radio alright so here's the radio
very<00:04:05.280> simple<00:04:05.700> which<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.150> good<00:04:06.360> thing<00:04:06.390> you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
very simple which is a good thing you

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.199 
very simple which is a good thing you
have<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.440> proportional<00:04:08.160> throttle<00:04:08.640> both

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
have a proportional throttle both

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.080 
have a proportional throttle both
forward<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.170> backwards<00:04:10.590> with<00:04:10.830> your<00:04:11.790> steering

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
forward and backwards with your steering

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.190 
forward and backwards with your steering
your<00:04:12.989> steering<00:04:13.320> trim<00:04:13.650> power<00:04:14.400> switch<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:16.019> is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
your steering trim power switch this is

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.300 
your steering trim power switch this is
really<00:04:16.470> cool<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.239> charge<00:04:18.239> cable<00:04:19.310> its

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
really cool it's the charge cable its

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.350 
really cool it's the charge cable its
retractable<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.450> knob<00:04:21.630> here<00:04:23.240> now<00:04:24.240> this

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
retractable with this knob here now this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.260 
retractable with this knob here now this
has<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> big<00:04:24.750> improvement<00:04:26.030> for<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
has a big improvement for the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.020 
has a big improvement for the
older<00:04:27.479> kids<00:04:27.750> over<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> hyperactive<00:04:29.460> five

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
older kids over the hyperactive five

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.760 
older kids over the hyperactive five
remote<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.050> that's<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.039> size<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:33.770> hand

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
remote and that's the size of it I hand

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.800 
remote and that's the size of it I hand
didn't<00:04:35.039> completely<00:04:35.789> fit<00:04:36.060> into<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
didn't completely fit into the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.409 
didn't completely fit into the
hyperactive<00:04:37.289> five<00:04:37.770> remote<00:04:38.159> but<00:04:38.430> there's

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
hyperactive five remote but there's

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.580 
hyperactive five remote but there's
plenty<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:40.050> room<00:04:40.199> on<00:04:40.440> this<00:04:41.310> one<00:04:43.069> so<00:04:45.470> let's<00:04:46.470> get

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
plenty of room on this one so let's get

00:04:46.590 --> 00:06:37.290 
plenty of room on this one so let's get
to<00:04:46.770> some<00:04:47.009> of<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.190> driving<00:04:47.400> footage
