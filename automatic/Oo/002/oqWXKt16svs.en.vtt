village<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.400> take<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> look<00:00:08.880> at

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
village we're going to take a look at

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.299 
village we're going to take a look at
shooting<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.600> soccer<00:00:09.870> ball<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.500> more

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
shooting the soccer ball and more

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.629 
shooting the soccer ball and more
specifically<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.660> create<00:00:13.170> swerve<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
specifically how we create swerve on the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.800 
specifically how we create swerve on the
ball<00:00:16.099> by<00:00:17.099> looking<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> soccer<00:00:17.939> ball<00:00:18.270> here

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
ball by looking at the soccer ball here

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
ball by looking at the soccer ball here
we<00:00:19.259> want<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> make<00:00:19.800> contact<00:00:20.400> if<00:00:20.579> we<00:00:20.700> think<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
we want to make contact if we think of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.749 
we want to make contact if we think of
the<00:00:21.180> soccer<00:00:21.450> ball<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.960> having<00:00:22.320> an<00:00:22.410> equator<00:00:22.770> we

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
the soccer ball as having an equator we

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.819 
the soccer ball as having an equator we
want<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> try<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.419> strike<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> ball<00:00:25.079> across

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
want to try and strike the ball across

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.450 
want to try and strike the ball across
the<00:00:26.419> outside<00:00:27.419> of<00:00:27.899> the<00:00:28.020> ball<00:00:28.259> to<00:00:28.829> low<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.250> ball

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the outside of the ball to low the ball

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.389 
the outside of the ball to low the ball
to<00:00:30.090> spin<00:00:30.450> so<00:00:31.110> it<00:00:31.259> starts<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.919> oat<00:00:32.099> say

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
to spin so it starts on an oat say

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.209 
to spin so it starts on an oat say
trajectory<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.750> comes<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
trajectory and then comes in and it's a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.029 
trajectory and then comes in and it's a
very<00:00:35.460> deceitful<00:00:35.850> shot<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.960> fill<00:00:37.199> defenders<00:00:37.769> if

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
very deceitful shot to fill defenders if

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.160 
very deceitful shot to fill defenders if
we<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.359> the<00:00:39.510> ground<00:00:41.750> our<00:00:42.750> toe<00:00:43.109> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we show that on the ground our toe is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.369 
we show that on the ground our toe is
pointed<00:00:43.769> down<00:00:44.420> we<00:00:45.420> place<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.870> non<00:00:46.079> kicking

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
pointed down we place our non kicking

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.160 
pointed down we place our non kicking
foot<00:00:46.589> beside<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.399> ball<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.960> come

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
foot beside the ball and as we come

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
foot beside the ball and as we come
through<00:00:49.429> we<00:00:50.429> actually<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.120> contact<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
through we actually make contact on the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
through we actually make contact on the
outside<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> ball<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:54.179> a<00:00:54.210> tool<00:00:54.690> pointed

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
outside of the ball with a tool pointed

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.559 
outside of the ball with a tool pointed
down<00:00:55.350> locked<00:00:55.859> ankle<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.690> spin<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.079> ball<00:00:58.289> away

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
down locked ankle to spin the ball away

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:22.539 
down locked ankle to spin the ball away
let's<00:01:00.569> show<00:01:00.749> that<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> demonstrators

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.319 

so<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.390> recap<00:01:24.520> creating<00:01:25.520> swerve<00:01:25.939> on<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
so just to recap creating swerve on the

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.899 
so just to recap creating swerve on the
soccer<00:01:26.630> ball<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.200> used<00:01:27.859> to<00:01:28.070> try<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.490> send<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
soccer ball is used to try and send the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.480 
soccer ball is used to try and send the
goalkeeper<00:01:29.509> one<00:01:29.750> way<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.259> have<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> ball

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
goalkeeper one way and have the ball

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.569 
goalkeeper one way and have the ball
finishing<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> other<00:01:32.679> we<00:01:33.679> create<00:01:34.039> spin<00:01:34.399> on

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
finishing the other we create spin on

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.209 
finishing the other we create spin on
the<00:01:34.700> ball<00:01:34.850> by<00:01:35.479> striking<00:01:35.899> towards<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.740> outside

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
the ball by striking towards the outside

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.490 
the ball by striking towards the outside
of<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.490> ball<00:01:37.700> with<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.939> locked<00:01:38.270> ankle<00:01:38.810> or<00:01:39.020> toe

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
of the ball with a locked ankle or toe

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.669 
of the ball with a locked ankle or toe
is<00:01:39.649> pointed<00:01:40.130> down<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:41.179> we<00:01:41.420> follow<00:01:41.750> through<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
is pointed down and we follow through to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.980 
is pointed down and we follow through to
create<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.219> spin<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.420> trajectory<00:01:44.899> of

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
create that spin so the trajectory of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.160 
create that spin so the trajectory of
the<00:01:45.140> ball<00:01:45.319> starts<00:01:46.159> moving<00:01:46.250> outward<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.170> then

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
the ball starts moving outward and then

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.770 
the ball starts moving outward and then
bends<00:01:48.469> inward<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.209> that's<00:01:50.209> swerving<00:01:50.689> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
bends inward and that's swerving the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:59.880 
bends inward and that's swerving the
soccer<00:01:50.990> ball

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950
