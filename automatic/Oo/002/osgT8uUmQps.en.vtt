 in front of the Uruguayan Álvaro Pereira 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.420

 also pressed the opponent we took 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.439
 being able to take a goal will also 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 done then I 'm inside the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.250
 provided right 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 That's the way we're setting up the team. 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.189
 we'll fit in soon and have 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.189
 a team gives the classification for the final 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.620
 the next challenge the challenge of são paulo 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.840
 will be against the saints Sunday in the stadium 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.490
 of morumbi for the tenth round of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.680
 Paulista championship 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.800
 a great opportunity for players 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.110
 Paulines are to break the fast of 11 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 classics and victory will be that this time 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.470
 make money 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.510
 Look, I'm going to say that it's a tie and it's 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.850
 had to make a bet 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.740
 Thank landmarks question before 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.690
 next subject and the palm trees 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.310
 so we mentioned before the palm trees 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.720
 actually lost alan kardec to the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 next match of the weekend 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.250
 against the botafogo and can probably 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.350
 also without another forward Dagogo 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.729
 who had a right thigh injury 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.739
 everything indicates that the palm trees will have to 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.869
 think of something else to attack in the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.730
 weekend to dem on the murici 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.989
 people saw muricy talking him really 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.120
 summarized very well what is paulo 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.430
 need to actually adjust the team 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.410
 I found the oswaldo the event in the second 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.989
 time went a lot but the goose muricy 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.610
 also upset when asked 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.890
 to him about the middle field of são paulo 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.450
 really does not walk the paulo henrique 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.310
 goose really is far from being that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.380
 player that everyone expects does not have 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.910
 been no combative guy but it's not the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.410
 Only problem is the paulo claro um 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 joint program
