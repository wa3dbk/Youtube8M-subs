00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.940
 more than 70% of the planet's surface 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.860
 earth is covered with water this 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 impressive data is enough to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 awaken all kinds of unknowns and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.300
 question us about how many we know 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.029
 really about life in the oceans 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 next I will show you one of the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.250
 strangest aquatic animals of the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.250
 planet 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.780
 the goblin shark is one of the species 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.210
 strangest shark that exists 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.769
 the first elf shark captured was 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.989
 near yokohama in japan so the year of 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.519
 1898 for its striking appearance called 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.920
 much the attention of their fishermen 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.879
 because they had discovered a species 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.879
 never seen before 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.250
 lives in the depths of the ocean and 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.770
 it is very difficult to locate it can get 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.620
 to measure up to 4 meters long and weigh 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.150
 up to 200 kilos its characteristic that 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.250
 more calls the attention of this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.680
 extraordinary shark is the shape of his 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.440
 head that has a prolonged 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 snout and powerful jaws that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.790
 they have served to evolve and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.729
 survive in such extreme conditions to 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.590
 great depths ensuring the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.009
 effective search for food like 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.460
 Cephalopod fish and own crustaceans 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.460
 of your environment 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.240
 its underwater habitat has the place 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.570
 between 200 and 1200 meters 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.729
 depth very likely this is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.470
 one of the main causes of the time 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.240
 information you have about him 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 a little bit is known about the goblin shark 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.060
 due to the difficulties of reaching your 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.060
 habitat 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.790
 the few species that have been 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.760
 collected have been due to their appearance 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.040
 in deep- sea â€‹â€‹fishing nets and 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.500
 dead or have barely survived some 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.720
 hours for now has not been registered 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.510
 attacks on humans by this 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.490
 shark because he lives a lot 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.700
 depth and it usually comes out a little 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.190
 surface without any doubt an animal 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.270
 really weird and with features 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.270
 that give fear and terror
