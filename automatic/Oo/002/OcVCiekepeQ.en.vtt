 also the and tv thanks for visiting us 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello friends today are you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.620
 Teaching how to replace these 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.620
 door shock absorbers 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 these are important to change because 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.119
 when the door opens this 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.609
 if they do not work correctly anymore, 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.310
 door no longer rises up if 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.970
 You not have one that is holding 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.920
 like a stick like they see it here because 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.989
 this does not work anymore 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.149
 first thing we're going to do is remove it and 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.010
 then we are going to put them this is something 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.460
 very simple the only thing they have to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.300
 do is come here and remove these 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 I sure here you take your first 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.120
 safe 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 and then it pulls on the zero part 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 A) Yes 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.850
 they saw how easy and then we're going to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.949
 come here 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.820
 we are going to come here and we are going to remove 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:09.140
 this 1 this remove here the screw and 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:13.700
 took this one out of here and it was totally 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.770
 removed from here and here happy as the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.770
 screw I will proceed to tighten it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.020
 ah 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 well this as you can see I already put the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 bra here 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.880
 he leaves here then he put it back and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.210
 it was fine and it closes well and opens the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 door 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.030
 let's try how it opens to see how we 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.750
 remains 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
 one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.190
 As you can see, it was very good 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.770
 it was very good and this prevents us from 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.280
 is falling all the time at the door is 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.690
 very easy and very simple they buy 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.160
 the shocks in the parts store 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.890
 Remember, it's one hundred percent better 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.860
 buy new parts that used well 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 it looks good this has been all for today 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.500
