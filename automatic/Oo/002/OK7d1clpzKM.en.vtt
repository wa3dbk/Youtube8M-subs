 condensed cream and that people 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 already talked about here can make the lite version is 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.460
 a thing that is like that the gelatine does 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.139

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.840
 the organ gets people I made it logical 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.350

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:17.770

 conventional attack this is a small 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.990
 who reaps 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.660

 let's see if you're tasty this is your 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.010
 The one you're approving now is with 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:40.840
 grape orang that this is it 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.910
 moreno budget our good this idea of 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560
 that this is great and this is the one 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.539
 basic that I put only the milk 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.030
 condensed the cream and ringworm 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.880
 cloud now we know you can put 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.370
 coconut milk is not that I liked the 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.669
 idea people to pilot and just do 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.440
 jokes you can flip the flavors right 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.389
 and the tip katia that we spoke here is 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.820
 so if you do it right 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.160
 gelatin with half of the water put 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.260
 unflavored gelatin next to the people 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.510
 they can make it so beautiful it comes 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.820
 magazine is this is condensed milk gives 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.550
 To pretend like a brigadier. 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.070
 so it does not give gelatinous consistency 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.410
 the consistency but also gives 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.930
 to do based on brigadier to give 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.669
 attention to gelatin also have 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.919
 but it will stay with your good you can 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.539
 make the basis of the game and put the 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.520
 to replace this but 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.320
