onesies but we got a lot of onesies for
like<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.280> 250<00:01:51.200> um<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.399> we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
like I think it was 250 um and then we

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
like I think it was 250 um and then we
got<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.880> overall<00:01:54.829> samples<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.130> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
got this overall samples not really is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.109 
got this overall samples not really is
that<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> doesn't<00:01:56.790> come<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.030> an

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that because it doesn't come with an

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.760 
that because it doesn't come with an
undershirt<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> says<00:01:58.500> fruit<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
undershirt but it says fruit on it and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
undershirt but it says fruit on it and
herbs<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.520> cute<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> colorful<00:02:03.090> like

herbs it's really cute and colorful like
little<00:02:03.869> thing<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.170> thought<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.560> cute

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
little thing I thought it would be cute

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.310 
little thing I thought it would be cute
to<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.100> we're<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> summer<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to like we're like in the summer in the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.589 
to like we're like in the summer in the
backyard<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:07.890> something<00:02:08.119> or<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> spring

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
backyard or something or in the spring

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.900 
backyard or something or in the spring
or<00:02:09.750> whatever

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
or whatever

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.070 
or whatever
and<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.720> was<00:02:12.340> 2<00:02:13.340> euro<00:02:13.580> 50<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.750> then

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and I think that was 2 euro 50 and then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.930 
and I think that was 2 euro 50 and then
we<00:02:15.200> got<00:02:15.350> this<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.890> actually<00:02:16.220> Carter's<00:02:16.610> brand

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
we got this is actually Carter's brand

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.400 
we got this is actually Carter's brand
which<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.120> an<00:02:17.330> American<00:02:17.810> brand<00:02:18.050> which<00:02:18.320> I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
which is an American brand which I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
which is an American brand which I
thought<00:02:18.560> was<00:02:18.680> funny<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.160> find<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.700> Germany

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
thought was funny to find in Germany

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.760 
thought was funny to find in Germany
because<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.780> don't<00:02:20.930> think<00:02:20.960> we<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.350> Carter's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
because I don't think we have Carter's

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.020 
because I don't think we have Carter's
but<00:02:22.040> yeah<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.460> like<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.820> really

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
but yeah it's just like this really

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.110 
but yeah it's just like this really
vibrant<00:02:23.690> orange<00:02:24.350> overalls<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.730> some<00:02:25.940> whole

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
vibrant orange overalls with some whole

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.830 
vibrant orange overalls with some whole
bugs<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.660> thought<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.620> cute<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.480> then

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
bugs on it thought it was cute and then

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.270 
bugs on it thought it was cute and then
we<00:02:29.930> got<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.560> don't<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.830> what<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.100> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
we got this I don't know what this is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.470 
we got this I don't know what this is
called<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.760> guys<00:02:31.910> can<00:02:32.120> leave<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
called you guys can leave it in the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.710 
called you guys can leave it in the
comments<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.920> got<00:02:34.070> this<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.460> was<00:02:34.550> from<00:02:34.790> H&amp;M

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
comments but we got this it was from H&amp;M

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.520 
comments but we got this it was from H&amp;M
I<00:02:35.870> guess<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.440> like<00:02:36.680> only<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.010> euro<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
I guess and it's like only one euro and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.750 
I guess and it's like only one euro and
then<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> last<00:02:39.800> couple<00:02:40.160> things<00:02:40.310> are<00:02:40.610> just

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
then the last couple things are just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.440 
then the last couple things are just
onesies<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:42.380> got<00:02:43.960> one<00:02:45.640> two-y<00:02:46.640> disease<00:02:47.000> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
onesies so we got one two-y disease and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.500 
onesies so we got one two-y disease and
this<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.350> probably<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.740> 1<00:02:48.980> euro<00:02:49.240> by<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.300> way

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
this was probably like 1 euro by the way

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.130 
this was probably like 1 euro by the way
I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.050> was<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.320> 250<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.550> then<00:02:53.360> yeah

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
I think that was like 250 and then yeah

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.660 
I think that was like 250 and then yeah
and<00:02:54.320> then<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:54.500> got<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.800> these<00:02:54.980> onesies<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.490> I

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and then we got all these onesies and I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.060 
and then we got all these onesies and I
think<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.240> pack<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.600> 7<00:02:56.990> yeah<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.950> think
