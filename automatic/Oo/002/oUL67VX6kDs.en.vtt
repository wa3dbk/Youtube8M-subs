one<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> interesting<00:00:38.820> differences<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
one of the interesting differences is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.939 
one of the interesting differences is
the<00:00:39.660> recurve<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> 710<00:00:42.539> recurves<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
the recurve the 710 recurves out of this

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.220 
the recurve the 710 recurves out of this
area<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> hollow<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.749> then<00:00:45.929> actually

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
area as the hollow but then actually

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
area as the hollow but then actually
comes<00:00:46.499> up<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.370> end<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:47.999> curves

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
comes up at the end right here curves

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.549 
comes up at the end right here curves
back<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.809> again<00:00:50.600> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> modulator<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
back up again on the modulator it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.040 
back up again on the modulator it
actually<00:00:52.980> goes<00:00:53.190> flat<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.909> this<00:00:54.149> area<00:00:54.600> sort<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
actually goes flat in this area sort of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.559 
actually goes flat in this area sort of
curves<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.460> again<00:00:56.760> comes<00:00:57.179> flat<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
curves down but then again comes flat it

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.349 
curves down but then again comes flat it
doesn't<00:00:57.870> curve<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.120> that<00:01:00.120> makes

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
doesn't curve back up and that makes

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.200 
doesn't curve back up and that makes
this<00:01:00.600> much<00:01:00.899> better<00:01:01.589> for<00:01:02.159> straight<00:01:02.519> push<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
this much better for straight push and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
this much better for straight push and
power<00:01:03.600> cuts<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> only<00:01:06.540> advantage<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.500> having

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
power cuts the only advantage to having

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490 
power cuts the only advantage to having
this<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.220> sweep<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.030> curve<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.660> is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
this up sweep or up curve right here is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
this up sweep or up curve right here is
when<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.040> cutting<00:01:11.520> away<00:01:11.850> from

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
when you're actually cutting away from

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.900 
when you're actually cutting away from
you<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.080> material<00:01:13.620> ramps<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.190> on<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> that's

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
you and material ramps up on this that's

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.030 
you and material ramps up on this that's
where<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> power<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> recurve<00:01:16.320> when

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
where you get the power of recurve when

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
where you get the power of recurve when
materials<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.610> ramping<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.810> but

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
materials are ramping up on it but

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
materials are ramping up on it but
that's<00:01:19.140> relatively<00:01:19.740> rare<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.210> me

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that's relatively rare and for me

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
that's relatively rare and for me
personally<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.260> better<00:01:22.440> if<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
personally this would be better if it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
personally this would be better if it
was<00:01:22.860> flat<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.370> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.820> may<00:01:24.060> flatten<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
was flat and I think I may flatten that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
was flat and I think I may flatten that
all<00:01:25.230> the<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.470> back<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:28.230> modulator<00:01:28.650> isn't

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
all the way back the modulator isn't

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
all the way back the modulator isn't
perfect<00:01:29.610> though<00:01:29.730> down<00:01:30.660> towards<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.230> end<00:01:31.260> here

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
perfect though down towards the end here

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
perfect though down towards the end here
as<00:01:31.800> I've<00:01:31.950> said<00:01:32.100> before<00:01:32.240> about<00:01:33.240> 3/8<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.960> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
as I've said before about 3/8 of this

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
as I've said before about 3/8 of this
are<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.890> sharpened<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.550> I'm

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
are not actually sharpened and I'm

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
are not actually sharpened and I'm
probably<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.380> putting<00:01:37.590> some

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
probably going to end up putting some

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
probably going to end up putting some
kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> coil<00:01:38.310> notched<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.240> share

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
kind of coil notched here so I can share

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.260 
kind of coil notched here so I can share
it<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.230> way<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.980> that's<00:01:41.270> most

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it all the way back and that's most

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.870 
it all the way back and that's most
likely<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.690> not<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> end<00:01:43.080> up<00:01:43.320> doing

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
likely that's not going to end up doing

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.000 
likely that's not going to end up doing
another<00:01:44.880> issue<00:01:45.150> is<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:46.320> has<00:01:46.590> sort<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
another issue is that this has sort of

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.680 
another issue is that this has sort of
the<00:01:47.130> lightning<00:01:47.490> strike<00:01:47.820> carbon<00:01:48.420> fiber

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
the lightning strike carbon fiber

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.320 
the lightning strike carbon fiber
pattern<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.010> handle<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:51.240> was

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
pattern in the handle and what was

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.120 
pattern in the handle and what was
surprising<00:01:51.480> to<00:01:52.080> me<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> lightning

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
surprising to me is that the lightning

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
surprising to me is that the lightning
strike<00:01:53.460> part<00:01:53.760> of<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.970> those<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.210> metal<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
strike part of it those little metal the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530 
strike part of it those little metal the
lathe<00:01:55.410> actually<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.370> coming<00:01:56.760> out<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.090> I've

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
lathe actually is coming out and I've

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.110 
lathe actually is coming out and I've
lost<00:01:57.840> probably<00:01:58.170> around<00:01:58.650> 10<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.070> 15%<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.850> itself

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
lost probably around 10 to 15% of itself

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.510 
lost probably around 10 to 15% of itself
rare<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.320> pops<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> little

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
rare and it just pops out and the little

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
rare and it just pops out and the little
metal<00:02:02.730> bits<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.270> sort<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> stick<00:02:03.660> off<00:02:03.870> and

every now and again one of them sort of
catches<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.760> hand<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.690> just<00:02:06.750> peel

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
catches in your hand and you just peel

it<00:02:07.170> off<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:08.009> there's<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.250> starting<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.879> come

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it off see there's one starting to come

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
it off see there's one starting to come
off<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.050> another<00:02:10.470> day<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
off right here and another day or so

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.470 
off right here and another day or so
that<00:02:11.340> will<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.700> enough<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.120> it'll<00:02:12.269> catch

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that will be off enough that it'll catch

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.780 
that will be off enough that it'll catch
and<00:02:12.719> then<00:02:13.200> pop<00:02:13.469> out<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:14.010> surprised<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> see

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and then pop out bit surprised to see

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
and then pop out bit surprised to see
that<00:02:14.819> happen

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
that happen

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.970 
that happen
the<00:02:17.640> main<00:02:17.910> reason<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.629> made<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.140> video

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the main reason that I made this video

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.729 
the main reason that I made this video
is<00:02:20.519> something<00:02:21.480> rather<00:02:21.660> surprising<00:02:22.379> happened

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
is something rather surprising happened

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.790 
is something rather surprising happened
when<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:23.160> using<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.849> 710<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:25.410> some<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
when I was using the 710 for some you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.430 
when I was using the 710 for some you
know<00:02:25.890> decently<00:02:26.340> heavy<00:02:26.550> use<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.290> found<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
know decently heavy use I found that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.100 
know decently heavy use I found that
after<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.950> 50<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.060> relatively<00:02:30.780> heavy

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
after about 50 or so relatively heavy

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.860 
knives such as the Swiss Army knives had
small<00:02:51.870> amount<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.230> play<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.299> continued

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
small amount to play so I continued

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
small amount to play so I continued
using<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.380> with<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> small<00:02:55.890> amount<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.370> play<00:02:56.610> I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
using it with a small amount of play I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.789 
using it with a small amount of play I
was<00:02:56.849> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.180> curious<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.380> would<00:02:58.500> notice

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
was kind of curious if I would notice

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.229 
was kind of curious if I would notice
any<00:02:58.950> functional<00:02:59.430> difference<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> really

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
any functional difference and I really

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
any functional difference and I really
wasn't<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.110> bit<00:03:01.349> disconcerning<00:03:01.980> though

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
wasn't it is a bit disconcerning though

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 
wasn't it is a bit disconcerning though
we're<00:03:02.549> using<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.970> relatively<00:03:03.480> high<00:03:04.379> end<00:03:04.650> life

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
we're using a relatively high end life

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.470 
we're using a relatively high end life
and<00:03:05.099> your<00:03:05.190> feeling<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.879> blade<00:03:06.090> sort<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and your feeling that the blade sort of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.990 
and your feeling that the blade sort of
move<00:03:06.629> around<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.260> bit

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
move around a little bit

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.339 
move around a little bit
however<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.269> lock<00:03:09.420> actually<00:03:09.629> collapsed

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
however the lock actually collapsed

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.830 
however the lock actually collapsed
during<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> cutting<00:03:11.640> which<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.269> mean<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.690> that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
during the cutting which I mean by that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.500 
during the cutting which I mean by that
the<00:03:13.049> blade<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.440> released<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:15.480> was

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the blade actually released that was

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.430 
the blade actually released that was
relatively<00:03:16.110> surprising<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.849> took<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.239> off

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
relatively surprising so I took it off

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.650 
relatively surprising so I took it off
cleaned<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.560> all<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.239> by<00:03:21.239> some<00:03:21.510> rather

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
cleaned it all up and by some rather

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.360 
cleaned it all up and by some rather
simple<00:03:22.139> experiments<00:03:22.769> was<00:03:22.950> able<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.190> figure

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
simple experiments was able to figure

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.610 
simple experiments was able to figure
out<00:03:23.609> why<00:03:23.760> what's<00:03:24.000> happening<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.139> when

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
out why what's happening is that when

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.410 
out why what's happening is that when
the<00:03:25.739> pivot<00:03:26.069> backed<00:03:26.310> off<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.180> blade

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
the pivot backed off and the blade

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.180 
the pivot backed off and the blade
developed<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.989> lateral<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.590> vertical<00:03:28.620> play

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
developed that lateral and vertical play

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.150 
developed that lateral and vertical play
any<00:03:29.880> loads<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.660> spine<00:03:31.109> then<00:03:31.530> even

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
any loads on the spine then even

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.640 
any loads on the spine then even
relatively<00:03:32.940> light<00:03:33.269> ones<00:03:33.450> could<00:03:34.200> cause<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
relatively light ones could cause the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.970 
relatively light ones could cause the
blade<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.190> release<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.889> would

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
blade to release and it would

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
blade to release and it would
essentially<00:03:41.480> unlock<00:03:42.530> while<00:03:43.530> what's

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
essentially unlock while what's

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.129 
essentially unlock while what's
happening<00:03:44.280> was<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.849> somehow<00:03:45.239> because<00:03:45.989> of

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
happening was that somehow because of

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.809 
happening was that somehow because of
the<00:03:46.230> fact<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> blade<00:03:46.980> had<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.430> play

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
the fact that the blade had this play

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.360 
the fact that the blade had this play
that<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.630> vertical<00:03:48.959> load<00:03:49.349> on<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> blade<00:03:49.919> could

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that a vertical load on the blade could

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.270 
that a vertical load on the blade could
put<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.639> lateral<00:03:51.030> load<00:03:51.329> on<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.410> stop<00:03:52.650> pin<00:03:52.919> and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
put a lateral load on the stop pin and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.099 
put a lateral load on the stop pin and
cause<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.819> release<00:03:54.180> that's<00:03:54.780> kind<00:03:55.049> of

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
cause it to release that's kind of

one<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.169> main<00:04:31.349> things<00:04:31.710> was<00:04:31.979> that<00:04:32.009> they're

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
one of the main things was that they're

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.089 
one of the main things was that they're
horrendously<00:04:33.449> burning<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.110> steel<00:04:34.349> because

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
horrendously burning the steel because

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.890 
horrendously burning the steel because
it<00:04:35.310> was<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:35.759> of<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:35.969> first<00:04:36.210> times<00:04:36.539> that<00:04:36.689> they

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
it was one of the first times that they

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.990 
it was one of the first times that they
used<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.259> very<00:04:37.500> high<00:04:37.740> than<00:04:38.069> Adium<00:04:38.400> steel<00:04:38.729> and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
used a very high than Adium steel and

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.999 
used a very high than Adium steel and
they're<00:04:39.689> not<00:04:40.080> trivial<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> growing

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
they're not trivial to growing

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.980 
they're not trivial to growing
especially<00:04:41.639> if<00:04:41.729> you<00:04:41.849> grind<00:04:42.030> them<00:04:42.240> after<00:04:42.810> heat

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
especially if you grind them after heat

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.179 
especially if you grind them after heat
treatment<00:04:43.409> but<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.680> generally<00:04:43.860> don't<00:04:44.159> want

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
treatment but you generally don't want

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.240 
treatment but you generally don't want
to<00:04:44.370> do<00:04:44.460> anyway<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:46.680> any<00:04:46.889> case<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:48.000> RSK<00:04:48.689> is

to do anyway in any case the RSK is
really<00:04:50.250> well<00:04:50.490> used<00:04:50.819> and<00:04:51.180> has<00:04:51.330> been<00:04:51.509> reground<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
really well used and has been reground a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.969 
really well used and has been reground a
bunch<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.319> times

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
bunch of times

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.409 
bunch of times
because<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.580> thinking<00:04:53.909> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.120> edge<00:04:54.240> from

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
because of thinking of the edge from

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.050 
because of thinking of the edge from
sharpening<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.400> pivot<00:04:56.400> doesn't<00:04:56.729> back<00:04:56.879> out

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
sharpening and pivot doesn't back out

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.909 
sharpening and pivot doesn't back out
very<00:04:57.360> easy<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> lot<00:04:58.139> isn't<00:04:58.409> actually

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
very easy and the lot isn't actually

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.659 
very easy and the lot isn't actually
unstable<00:04:59.520> if<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.330> do<00:05:00.449> loosen<00:05:00.840> up<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.080> pivot

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
unstable if you do loosen up the pivot

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.869 
unstable if you do loosen up the pivot
so<00:05:02.669> I'm<00:05:03.150> gonna<00:05:03.419> get<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:03.779> back<00:05:04.199> off<00:05:04.469> my

so I'm gonna get that back off my

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.550 
so I'm gonna get that back off my
brother<00:05:05.879> have<00:05:06.719> a<00:05:06.750> look<00:05:07.020> at<00:05:07.139> both<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.379> them<00:05:07.529> and

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
brother have a look at both of them and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.290 
brother have a look at both of them and
take<00:05:07.740> them<00:05:07.919> apart<00:05:08.009> and<00:05:08.370> see<00:05:08.580> if<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.789> can't<00:05:09.090> sort

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
take them apart and see if I can't sort

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.439 
take them apart and see if I can't sort
of<00:05:09.419> figure<00:05:09.659> out<00:05:09.719> what's<00:05:10.110> going<00:05:10.500> on<00:05:11.449> because

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
of figure out what's going on because

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.550 
of figure out what's going on because
this<00:05:12.750> isn't<00:05:13.520> terribly<00:05:14.520> useful<00:05:14.789> for<00:05:15.300> me<00:05:15.449> if<00:05:15.719> the

this isn't terribly useful for me if the

you put thread Locker on it so kind of

resistance<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.860> main<00:06:08.129> reason<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:08.550> you

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
resistance the main reason that you

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.360 
resistance the main reason that you
don't<00:06:09.089> use<00:06:09.389> those<00:06:09.659> is<00:06:10.409> because<00:06:10.919> the<00:06:11.099> primary

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
don't use those is because the primary

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.029 
don't use those is because the primary

carbide aggravates can be so huge it

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.309 
carbide aggravates can be so huge it
forces<00:06:14.580> you<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:14.789> either<00:06:15.180> use<00:06:15.539> very<00:06:15.900> large<00:06:16.050> edge

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
forces you to either use very large edge

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.589 
forces you to either use very large edge
angles<00:06:16.770> or<00:06:17.189> put<00:06:17.520> up<00:06:17.639> with<00:06:17.849> that<00:06:17.969> sort<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.330> very

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.800 
that you get when you get low edge
angles<00:06:24.110> so<00:06:25.110> why<00:06:25.319> use<00:06:25.529> this<00:06:25.800> steel<00:06:26.099> and<00:06:26.430> not

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
angles so why use this steel and not

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.260 
angles so why use this steel and not
slim<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.990> edge<00:06:28.080> out<00:06:28.409> and<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:29.279> angle<00:06:29.729> reduced

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
slim the edge out and the angle reduced

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.290 
slim the edge out and the angle reduced
significantly<00:06:31.219> now<00:06:32.219> not<00:06:32.639> a<00:06:32.669> big<00:06:32.879> issue<00:06:33.000> to

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
significantly now not a big issue to

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.480 
significantly now not a big issue to
solve<00:06:33.539> of<00:06:33.839> course<00:06:34.310> I<00:06:35.310> can<00:06:36.089> regrind<00:06:36.629> this<00:06:37.339> put<00:06:38.339> a

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
solve of course I can regrind this put a

solve of course I can regrind this put a

sort of issues with it that I think I am

going to modify it somewhat and of

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.399 
going to modify it somewhat and of
course<00:06:53.849> once<00:06:54.060> you<00:06:54.180> do<00:06:54.330> start<00:06:54.389> modifying<00:06:54.930> you

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
course once you do start modifying you

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:56.719 
course once you do start modifying you
can't<00:06:55.650> really<00:06:55.949> use<00:06:56.099> it<00:06:56.219> as<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.340> point<00:06:56.550> of

can't really use it as a point of

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.200 
can't really use it as a point of
comparison<00:06:57.289> in<00:06:58.289> that<00:06:58.590> anymore<00:06:59.550> and<00:06:59.969> I<00:07:00.180> am

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
comparison in that anymore and I am

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.600 
comparison in that anymore and I am
really<00:07:00.719> curious<00:07:00.960> to<00:07:01.259> see<00:07:01.289> how<00:07:01.620> the<00:07:01.680> m4<00:07:02.280> in<00:07:02.430> this

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
really curious to see how the m4 in this

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.899 
really curious to see how the m4 in this
compares<00:07:03.030> to<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.300> spider<00:07:03.569> call<00:07:03.840> him<00:07:04.020> for<00:07:04.289> and

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
compares to the spider call him for and

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.760 
compares to the spider call him for and
heir<00:07:05.960> so<00:07:06.960> I'm<00:07:07.080> probably<00:07:07.229> going<00:07:07.469> to<00:07:07.530> end<00:07:07.590> up

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
heir so I'm probably going to end up

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.270 
heir so I'm probably going to end up
rewriting<00:07:08.370> this<00:07:08.550> to<00:07:09.389> a<00:07:09.719> full<00:07:10.319> flat<00:07:10.620> grind<00:07:10.650> and

rewriting this to a full flat grind and
taking<00:07:11.969> this<00:07:12.120> up<00:07:12.360> sweep<00:07:12.629> off<00:07:13.199> the<00:07:13.740> edge<00:07:13.919> right

taking this up sweep off the edge right
there<00:07:14.550> and<00:07:15.199> dramatically<00:07:16.199> thin<00:07:16.500> out<00:07:16.650> the<00:07:16.800> edge

side edge bevel on I may even go bit
lower<00:07:26.279> than<00:07:26.460> that<00:07:26.610> because<00:07:27.029> the<00:07:27.150> ear<00:07:27.270> is<00:07:27.509> a<00:07:27.569> bit

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:27.779
