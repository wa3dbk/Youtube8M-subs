00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
really harder than I want to but

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
really harder than I want to but
basically<00:01:18.479> you're<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.840> pop<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.380> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
basically you're gonna pop this out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.330 
basically you're gonna pop this out
first<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.810> edge<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
first on this edge there we go so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.740 
first on this edge there we go so
there's<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> first<00:01:23.880> step<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.540> see

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
there's the first step so you can see

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
there's the first step so you can see
the<00:01:24.900> bulb<00:01:25.110> burning<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.950> let<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.310> turn

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the bulb burning in there let me turn

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
the bulb burning in there let me turn
this<00:01:26.640> off<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> first

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this off so you can see so the first

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
this off so you can see so the first
step<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.009> tab<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> come<00:01:30.240> out

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
step is that tab there has to come out

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.260 
step is that tab there has to come out
you've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.560> gentle<00:01:32.030> now<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you've got to be really gentle now it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.020 
you've got to be really gentle now it
would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.390> nice<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.409> whole<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:35.280> would

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
would be nice if the whole thing would

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
would be nice if the whole thing would
flip<00:01:36.659> down<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> does<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.040> instead

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
flip down but it does not so instead

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
flip down but it does not so instead
you've<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.000> go<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> edge<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.439> where

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you've got to go in this edge here where

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.120 
you've got to go in this edge here where
the<00:01:41.220> hinges<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.320> very<00:01:43.350> gentle

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you don't want to break it with just a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
you don't want to break it with just a
