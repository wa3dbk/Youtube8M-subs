Batman series it says we're the Batman
toy<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.559> theory<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.210> figure

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
toy so my theory that it was a figure

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.740 
toy so my theory that it was a figure
car<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.650> mean<00:00:17.640> excuse<00:00:17.910> me<00:00:17.940> figure<00:00:18.330> vehicle

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
car I mean excuse me figure vehicle

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.769 
car I mean excuse me figure vehicle
figure<00:00:19.020> 4<00:00:19.199> you'll<00:00:19.410> figure<00:00:19.680> has<00:00:20.369> failed<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.600> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
figure 4 you'll figure has failed it is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.980 
figure 4 you'll figure has failed it is
a<00:00:22.050> mask<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.880> guess<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.480> close<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
a mask but I guess it's close to a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.859 
a mask but I guess it's close to a
figure<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.039> become<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.970> figure<00:00:27.359> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
figure because you become the figure so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.960 
figure because you become the figure so
not<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> total<00:00:28.500> fail<00:00:28.740> remember<00:00:29.609> check<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
not a total fail remember check that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.130 
not a total fail remember check that
