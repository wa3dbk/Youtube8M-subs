00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.690
 safe from wickie and the strong men 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.030
 Since we had such a viking helmet 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 and I want to show you today how 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 you simply mosque 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.050
 So you just cardboard 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.439
 Of course you can bend one 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.810
 viking helmet tinker can you okay 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.610
 should use a carton of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 at least 21 cm long that is you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.120
 should first record the bund the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 Bund means the lower part of the later 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 is fixed in your head 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:50.420
 it is 21 cm long and three centimeters long 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420
 wide 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 OK 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.010
 Now you should be on the side here and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.860
 on the other side at about three 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 extend centimeters 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.799
 since he would have to kill the helmet later 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.090
 cards cm here and the three centimeters 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.670
 Of course, on the other side 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 then you have to in the middle of a 5 cm 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.350
 wide and ten centimeters long berlin 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.810
 your drawing which is the middle of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.790
 your hero will 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.720
 here should sign two bars 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 because the limites come later the heads 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:44.070
 our helmet so ten centimeters here 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:52.729
 and also in 5 cm wide distance yet 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.729
 by 10 cm are connected at the top 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.119
 so now you have to draw your oval because 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.970
 a viking helmet is as we know 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.700
 oval that is you catch it easy 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 others tried as was possible 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 your helmet to draw the same 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.340
 I did it on the other side 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.900

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.319
 cut out the helmet and as a template 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.180
 for your second carton 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.109
