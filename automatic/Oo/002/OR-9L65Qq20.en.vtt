one<00:02:13.550> when<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> put<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.750> my<00:02:14.840> fingers<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.110> test

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
one when I put on my fingers to test

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.120 
one when I put on my fingers to test
know<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:17.120> was<00:02:17.840> kind<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.319> late<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.950> could

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
know it was kind of late like you could

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.309 
know it was kind of late like you could
kind<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.580> see<00:02:19.730> through<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.360> really<00:02:20.599> so

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
kind of see through it but not really so

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.729 
kind of see through it but not really so
you<00:02:21.830> could<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:22.520> two<00:02:22.730> coats<00:02:22.970> or<00:02:23.599> if<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.530> put<00:02:24.709> a

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
you could do two coats or if you put a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.680 
you could do two coats or if you put a
little<00:02:24.950> bit<00:02:25.160> thicker<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.760> let<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:25.940> dry<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
little bit thicker and let it dry a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
little bit thicker and let it dry a
little<00:02:26.870> bit<00:02:27.080> longer<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:28.010> would<00:02:28.130> be<00:02:28.220> okay<00:02:28.520> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
little bit longer that would be okay it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.000 
little bit longer that would be okay it
doesn't<00:02:29.720> take<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:29.959> long<00:02:30.260> dry<00:02:30.590> stick<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
doesn't take that long dry stick to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.790 
doesn't take that long dry stick to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
take to dry it's not doesn't take too

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.610 
take to dry it's not doesn't take too
long<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:37.730> also<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:39.110> them<00:02:39.319> dry
