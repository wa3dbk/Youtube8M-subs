00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
 we will start creating another template first by designing another design 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.400
 this consists of taking our design from a simple image to still kml documents 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.709
 function 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.089
 this layout process is exactly the same as we had 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.059
 convulsed and in fact completely henry very good 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.840
 the organization of the archives 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 Initially, it is similar 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.570
 we have the project folder itself 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.089
 what is this 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.079
 inside that folder we have the design folder 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.970
 documents bag inc 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 in design we will place all the elements of which three graphic phases 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.550
 be it the wolf the interface likewise any other design element 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.810
 in the documents folder we place any document that provides them 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.090
 client for the website 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.649
 and acapetahua usaid 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.070
 we are going to place the html file there 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.170
 along with the images have already divided exported 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.440
 and in another css team 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.430
 for now the design folder we have a site interface 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.690
 It is designed with failures although we can also do it with photo ochoa 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 a little uncertain graphic program that allows to export 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.460
 for the web in this case I imposed faults on them so that we are going to open with 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 said program 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.960
 right click 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.060
 open com 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050
 fagor cs4 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.390
 and now I'm going to continue between men we are immediate process of layout 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.420
 patek the tab does not serve to hide the tools and so see the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.090
 design 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.340
 full 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.050
 we can see that for now we are going to use 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.030
 no part of useful to do with content yes that we should hide this 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 to stay with only the base of the interface 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 for the second time for motorcycles the tools 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 in this case we go to the capable panel and that the content layer we go to a cultured rule 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.950
 to stay only with no extra interface 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.750
 we press the tabulation key again 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 and now we are looking for division tool 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.000
 and we created the first cut in our design 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.380
 will be to cut to the head by little clown fiat outside the framework of 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.159
 design yes 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.930
 because standing a small shadow that also interests 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.260
 can take a breath 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 the second cut will be all this apart 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.049
 and the third 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.129
 epera in this other part of the header 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.739
 also a little outside to take there the shadow that this one on the edge 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.109
 design 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.259
 we do this very carefully so that each division agrees with 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.579
 previous and there is none that is below or above the previous 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.559
 let's stop now another division that will be the repetitive image of the background 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.559
 We do this by making a cut throughout this part 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.989
 in this way this image when repeated gives the illusion of continuity 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.889
 when content expand like this down 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.839
 we change take advantage to make a division in the background image to the 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:48.400
 page 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.159
 since we have there is a gradient 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.449
 that in order to apply it correctly we have to take at least one 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.140
 division 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.050
 definition of degree to the end then from there we will place a deep 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.729
 solid in the document will be feared 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.449
 finally we went to the bottom the design 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.360
 and we have 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.739
 he comes page 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.739
 let's tell you the following way 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.349
 and ready 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.499
 well give him now a descriptive man finish image 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.539
 We were selected treatment 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.739
 we choose 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.969
 each division i in the properties panel 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.339
 in this field 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.669
 we show his previous one and we put there a man a little more descriptive in 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.879
 this case the first image of the head or could be called 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.159
 all 1 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.049
 the second of we will love top 2 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 remember line of the previous ones 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.779
 third 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.779
 all 3 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.519
 now this background image kinder 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.879
 content background 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.900
 I estimate the background of the website to sign you 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.839
 photo page 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.839
 in the case of the footer do not be bad yourself 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.179
 has a page 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.809
 ipro we now know how to optimize each division 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.819
 in the preview 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.209
 here we have chosen 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.909
 each division and assign it an image format and a quality level 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.840
 the case the first three that shelton 1 fools 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 intopress 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.819
 with keys jokes the podiums and selecting the three together 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.199
 of similar cases 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.199
 and can apply the same level of optimization 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.689
 you've done all three with the salty joke key 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:40.719
 and now 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.389
 he placed here the jpg format that is best suited for this type of 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.169
 images 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.949
 and 88 percent quality because you can not see 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.110
 nothing else 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.620
 the case d 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.800
 the content background apply gif format 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.749
 Cuba changes colors of the 156 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.309
 so we do not lose any detail 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.520
 in the shadow 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 in the case of the background image of the page 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:12.240
 it is better to be able to find page 8% more and is good quality 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.219
 and in the end we have 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.219
 the footer will be in gif format 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.139
 It is also not according to colors 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.139
 what size is quite small 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.250
 now it says we go every division with the key always left to be the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.250
 export 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.020
 let's go at least ciu 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.999
 to export 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.150
 we look for love the folder in another project in this case 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.589
 it's on desks they're called standard project with bari 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:45.639
 and to folder 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.629
 Buenos Aires 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.110
 let's create a folder called 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.960
 inventions 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.909
 It is important that you follow meticulously in this way im people start 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.520
 since the file structure it uses and a 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.119
 I love you the folder called this way 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.099
 the bouquets enter 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.710
 and now once inside that folder you feel that we are 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.020
 in the project 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.330
 the usaid folder 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.839
 in the folder and month 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.900
 there are hundreds 11 say the following answer 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.479
 only images 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.810
 divisions export divisions 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.289
 they say they wanted to export divisions 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.189
 Solon selected divisions 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.219
 and only the current page 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.659
 howard ar 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.319
 and now we go to the desk 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.819
 and we confirm that everything is fine 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.240
 We will respect standard project company 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.830
 Buenos Aires 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.009
 imex 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.439
 there we have then 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.430
 our divisions 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.189
 this is why we can now go through adri 9 to create another goat 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.219
 html our guys ccs
