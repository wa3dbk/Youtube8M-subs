00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.320 
Trapattoni's gonna pick with the Faroe
Islands<00:03:07.770> game<00:03:07.950> being<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.370> close<00:03:08.700> well<00:03:09.180> he

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
Islands game being so close well he

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.840 
Islands game being so close well he
build<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.200> towards<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.710> game<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
build up towards the game the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.940 
build up towards the game the
competitive<00:03:12.330> game<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.200> know<00:03:13.530> trapping

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
competitive game and you know trapping

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.230 
competitive game and you know trapping
one<00:03:14.130> throw<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.340> every<00:03:14.550> game<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:15.000> played

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
one throw in every game and he played

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.030 
one throw in every game and he played
the<00:03:15.270> same<00:03:15.540> way<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:16.560> think<00:03:16.890> he'll

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the same way so I don't think he'll

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560 
the same way so I don't think he'll
deviate<00:03:17.459> too<00:03:17.640> much<00:03:17.820> away<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.450> way

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
deviate too much away from the way

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.270 
deviate too much away from the way
usually<00:03:18.780> does<00:03:19.110> it's<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.739> big<00:03:19.890> game<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.070> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
usually does it's a big game for the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.949 
usually does it's a big game for the
players<00:03:20.520> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.850> every<00:03:21.450> player<00:03:21.660> will<00:03:21.780> want

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
players as well every player will want

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.229 
players as well every player will want
to<00:03:22.080> play<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:23.550> know<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.880> answer<00:03:24.150> your

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
to play and you know to answer your

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.940 
to play and you know to answer your
question<00:03:24.570> again<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.110> think<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.590> better<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
question again I think the better the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.560 
question again I think the better the
loss<00:03:26.100> at<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.310> moment<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.820> think<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> noise

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
loss at the moment I think on the noise

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.090 
loss at the moment I think on the noise
the<00:03:27.750> players<00:03:27.989> will<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.830> enjoy

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the players will really really enjoy

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.830 
the players will really really enjoy
again<00:03:29.250> yeah<00:03:29.730> they'll<00:03:30.120> certainly<00:03:30.300> be<00:03:30.510> looking

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
again yeah they'll certainly be looking

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
again yeah they'll certainly be looking
forward<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.530> everybody<00:03:31.709> will<00:03:32.100> want<00:03:32.580> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
forward to it and everybody will want to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.940 
forward to it and everybody will want to
be<00:03:32.790> involved<00:03:33.060> Liam<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> fixture

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
like that what sort of dangers has it

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.550 
like that what sort of dangers has it
because<00:03:36.510> certainly<00:03:36.840> we<00:03:36.989> don't<00:03:37.080> want<00:03:37.260> players

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
because certainly we don't want players

it's a bad game like prestige game you
know<00:03:54.150> flow<00:03:54.330> FA<00:03:55.140> over<00:03:55.170> there<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:55.590> well<00:03:55.800> too<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.010> I

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
know flow FA over there as well too so I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.340 
know flow FA over there as well too so I
think<00:03:57.120> Trapattoni<00:03:57.480> will<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.870> careful<00:03:58.170> enough

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
think Trapattoni will be careful enough

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.040 
think Trapattoni will be careful enough
the<00:03:58.500> way<00:03:58.769> he<00:03:58.920> plays<00:03:59.190> yeah<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.060> nobody<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.019> be

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
the way he plays yeah and nobody will be

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.810 
the way he plays yeah and nobody will be
taken<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.709> Pharos<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.280> granted<00:04:02.670> because

taken the the Pharos for granted because

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.820 
taken the the Pharos for granted because

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
we're not exactly in a rich vein of form
