00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
a there's a trick about that if you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
a there's a trick about that if you
don't<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.980> videos

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
don't know about that we have videos

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
don't know about that we have videos
about<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.480> through<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
about that but then you go through the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
about that but then you go through the
maze<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> come<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> pack

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
maze then you come down to the pack

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
maze then you come down to the pack
lunch<00:00:53.579> area<00:00:53.820> down<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> gazebo<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
lunch area down the gazebo and then you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
lunch area down the gazebo and then you
stay<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.489> area<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.329> there's<00:00:57.510> only<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
stay in that area and there's only one

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.770 
stay in that area and there's only one
window<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.680> has<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> fairly<00:00:59.730> limited<00:01:00.270> spawn

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
window which has a fairly limited spawn

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
window which has a fairly limited spawn
there's<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.199> too<00:01:01.379> many<00:01:01.559> zombies<00:01:01.890> at

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there's not really too many zombies at

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.969 
there's not really too many zombies at
spawn<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.030> window<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
spawn in that window it's kind of just a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
spawn in that window it's kind of just a
little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.489> more<00:01:05.790> frequent<00:01:06.510> than<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.110> window

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
little bit more frequent than the window

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
little bit more frequent than the window
and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.310> rise<00:01:08.610> where<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.210> nav<00:01:09.450> card<00:01:09.659> table<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and I rise where the nav card table is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
and I rise where the nav card table is
and<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:11.189> very<00:01:11.400> easy<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> hold<00:01:11.850> especially

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and it's very easy to hold especially

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.760 
and it's very easy to hold especially
the<00:01:12.330> four<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.229> obviously<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the four people and obviously have a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
the four people and obviously have a
pact<00:01:13.950> punch<00:01:14.250> machine<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.299> if

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pact punch machine right in here so if

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
pact punch machine right in here so if
you<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> low<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> ammo<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.590> epic<00:01:16.830> gun

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you do get a low on ammo on one epic gun

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.289 
you do get a low on ammo on one epic gun
which<00:01:17.189> aren't<00:01:17.400> backbone<00:01:17.850> chick<00:01:18.060> needs<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
which aren't backbone chick needs to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
which aren't backbone chick needs to
just<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.259> you're<00:01:19.770> done

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
just put that in and then you're done

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
just put that in and then you're done
you've<00:01:20.220> got<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.460> ammo<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you've got more ammo and you know you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.560 
you've got more ammo and you know you
can<00:01:22.020> stay<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> long<00:01:23.159> time

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
zombies kind of get confused a little
bit<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> slow<00:01:36.180> down<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bit in the kind of slow down which is a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
bit in the kind of slow down which is a
bit<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> glitch<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> exploit<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.810> kind

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
bit of a glitch and exploit of some kind

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.200 
bit of a glitch and exploit of some kind
so<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.189> something<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.119> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so that's something you can use to your

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
so that's something you can use to your
advantage<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.320> obviously<00:01:43.680> having<00:01:43.979> claymores

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
advantage and obviously having claymores

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
advantage and obviously having claymores
is<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:45.030> useful<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.479> obviously

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is very very useful because obviously

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
is very very useful because obviously
this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.649> dead<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.250> zone<00:01:47.790> you're<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.240> going

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
this is a dead end zone you're not going

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.620 
this is a dead end zone you're not going
to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.610> having<00:01:50.909> too<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.210> fun<00:01:51.270> if

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
to be you know having too much fun if

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.539 
to be you know having too much fun if
you<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.960> into<00:01:52.170> trouble<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.070> having<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you do get into trouble but having the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
you do get into trouble but having the
paralyzer<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> petrol<00:01:54.930> fire<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.470> either

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
paralyzer or the petrol fire or either

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.080 
paralyzer or the petrol fire or either
one<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.310> useful<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:56.880> because

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
one is very useful here because

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
one is very useful here because
obviously<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.630> unlimited<00:01:57.960> ammo<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> it's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
obviously it's unlimited ammo and it's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.069 
obviously it's unlimited ammo and it's
loads<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.549> zombies<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> will

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
loads of zombies right down so you will

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
loads of zombies right down so you will
have<00:02:01.310> effectively<00:02:02.310> no<00:02:02.549> problem<00:02:03.000> with

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
have effectively no problem with

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
have effectively no problem with
defending<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.780> even<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.890> this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
defending here even when I'm on this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.700 
defending here even when I'm on this
doing<00:02:05.430> solo<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.750> five<00:02:06.990> perks<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.590> one

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
doing solo I've got five perks on one

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
doing solo I've got five perks on one
round<00:02:07.920> 19<00:02:08.369> i'm<00:02:08.580> still<00:02:08.849> holding<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.360> very

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
round 19 i'm still holding it very

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.300 
round 19 i'm still holding it very
easily<00:02:10.229> especially<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> scavenger

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
easily especially with the scavenger

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
smoke as well because there's on

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.570

do come down and die quite close to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.070 
do come down and die quite close to
where<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.850> asking<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.330> easily<00:02:16.600> run<00:02:16.840> into

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
where you asking just easily run into

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.930 
where you asking just easily run into
that<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.380> no<00:02:17.530> problem<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.760> can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
that like no problem and then you can

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.970 
that like no problem and then you can
have<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> welcome<00:02:19.660> respite<00:02:19.870> from<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.620> undead

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
have a welcome respite from the undead

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.770 
have a welcome respite from the undead
hordes<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.490> us<00:02:21.610> tear<00:02:21.970> out<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.150> eyeballs<00:02:22.510> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
hordes of us tear out your eyeballs and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.560 
hordes of us tear out your eyeballs and
brains<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.640> pack<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> punch

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
brains so this is the pack a punch

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.450 
brains so this is the pack a punch
defense<00:02:25.960> method<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.650> hope<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.980> enjoy

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
defense method and I hope that you enjoy

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.330 
defense method and I hope that you enjoy
it<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.510> probably<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.560> best

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it and I think it is probably the best

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.060 
it and I think it is probably the best
if<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:30.900> second<00:02:31.900> or<00:02:32.020> third<00:02:32.230> best<00:02:32.590> defense

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
if not second or third best defense

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.400 
if not second or third best defense
method<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:34.210> map<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.780> I'm<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.290> be
