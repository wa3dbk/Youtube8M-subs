00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.340
 spider-man shattered dimension 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 the main idea of ​​the game is to collect spiders from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 different universes together here 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 are present and may think spider 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.510
 Spidey from the ultimate universe spider 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 noir and of course 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.880
 2099 the idea is just great but also 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.150
 gameplay implementation as for me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.009
 snore a little on my right leg i'm not 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 time during the passage caught himself thinking 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.320
 that the game is boring and childish I can not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.920
 say she's bad she has her own 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 pros 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.930
 but I expected a little more and to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 Unfortunately, not all my hopes were 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.989
 justified 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.739
 what can I not say about the version for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.739
 nintendo ds 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 as you noticed i decided to move a little 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.369
 from the subject of retro and talk about something 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 less modern thing is that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 up to shattered dimension 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.740
 difficult and metiid figurative 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 first was metroid then to cool 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.440
 but after cooling in the flooded 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 metroid began to resemble everything for 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.210
 those who are not in the subject, I will explain what is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 metroid concept 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 so you are given a map which you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.170
 explore as you progress 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.570
 it is full of all kinds of forks caches and 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.440
 other nonsense of course no 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 linearity 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.450
 on the card can be worn with any amount 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.580
 returning from the end of the places where you already 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 happened sooner or later you will 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.289
 find a place through which it is impossible 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.660
 pass without a certain skill and this 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.990
 the most skill is given only after winning 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.959
 over the next boss for example you came down 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.150
 up to a suspicious wall but you can't 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.030
 destroy since there is no such skill 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.910
 you yet destroy the walls you go to the boss 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.160
 put his ass on this one 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.010
 skill and destroy the wall 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.600
 in such a pace and the game to 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.610
 example in the same to the table and to 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.519
 explore the area and pumped 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.000
 it was wildly interesting but here in terms of 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.340
 pumping guys shalturili if in caste 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.860
 raids swing was vital 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.079
 for the victory over the bosses here all 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.510
 pumping is limited to finds 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.540
 improvements after defeating opponents 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.019
 they give you nothing but a similar game 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.019
 can be forgiven by the way of four spiders 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.320
 there are only 3 ultimate spayds left 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.989
 I did not understand why ultimate 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.500
 my favorite universe and it was decided 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.870
 cut no you remove the 2099 universe 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.390
 which I just do not digest because 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 there are no interpretations of supervillains here 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.100
 they decided to remove 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.380
 the most delicious first thing about me is this 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.980
 the game attracts so this combat system 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.140
 she is good she is spectacular intuitive 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.670
 giving the opportunity to use with might and main 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 cobwebs and finish off opponents of the air 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.300
 in general I am happy with it for a 2d platformer 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.180
 what you need to fight with the bosses, too, are 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.220
 hearty , they are all completely different and to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.540
 he really needs to look 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 individual approach 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.459
 and after the last battle with mysterio, I 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.950
 generally felt like a gynecologist 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.340
 just like my father because my fingers hurt 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.310
 so mom don't grieve and yet in the game 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.280
 there are two shoals in the first place 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.150
 monochromatic locations you explore the map 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 but around 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.910
 nothing changes much and it's sad 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.269
 no every universe has a specific 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.090
 with this but no more so secondly it 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.400
 transitions between universes one card 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.769
 but for every piece of it is responsible 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.620
 certain universe and on going 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.410
 between them you enter the portal and here 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.169
 here the developers decided to impose on us 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.470
 use the touchpad nowhere else 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.720
 in order to pass the portal is necessary 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.490
 first in circular motions of the stylus 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.640
 unleash a piece of plate 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.289
 and then fend off the hands and squid with 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.450
 head aquariums 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.300
 in order to get rid of squid 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.729
 you just need to poke at him 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.710
 requires that you support a little 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.570
 on them the stylus in the early stages 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.210
 passing it will seem to you 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.419
 funny but closer to the middle of you 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.390
 want to barf from this despite 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.580
 these shoals play very interesting 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.680
 oddly enough the game does not feel like 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.440
 compare with mettiid and u want 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.740
 compare with the good old with the mountain 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.890
 I have something like spiders 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.680
 old school 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.720
 but on this I do not forget everything 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.820
 subscribe to the game file channel 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.370
 go to the site and during 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.789
 Masturbate to you, I wish you a pleasant 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.520
 games 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.419
 and I'll go inflating his rubber 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.850
 Natasha 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.850
 you don't blame everyone yet
