bit more not make it look like just
another<00:02:48.320> piece<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:49.010> freaking<00:02:49.460> meat<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.030> mean

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
another piece of freaking meat I mean

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.390

don't get me wrong she looks nice and
she's<00:02:52.550> very<00:02:52.610> pretty<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.120> everything<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
she's very pretty and everything in the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.020 
she's very pretty and everything in the
scene<00:02:53.930> was<00:02:54.170> somewhat<00:02:54.620> humorous<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.700> if<00:02:55.910> you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
scene was somewhat humorous but if you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.940 
scene was somewhat humorous but if you
were<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.180> cut<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.600> from<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> manga<00:02:57.110> entirely

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
were to cut it from the manga entirely

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
were to cut it from the manga entirely
it<00:02:58.310> really<00:02:58.610> wouldn't<00:02:58.850> have<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.150> effect<00:02:59.450> on<00:02:59.570> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it really wouldn't have an effect on the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.660 
it really wouldn't have an effect on the
rest<00:02:59.840> of<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.110> story<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:00.800> at<00:03:01.220> least<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
rest of the story but at least the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.550 
rest of the story but at least the
character<00:03:02.030> artwork<00:03:02.060> was<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.050> somewhat

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
character artwork was good and somewhat

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.230 
character artwork was good and somewhat
funny<00:03:03.800> at<00:03:03.980> times<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.400> mean<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.610> little<00:03:04.970> bit<00:03:05.120> of

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
funny at times I mean a little bit of

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.480 
funny at times I mean a little bit of
action<00:03:05.600> at<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> end<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.320> I'm<00:03:06.890> gonna<00:03:07.100> cut<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.430> a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
action at the end so I'm gonna cut it a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.190 
action at the end so I'm gonna cut it a
little<00:03:07.520> bit<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:07.970> slack<00:03:08.210> because<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.900> but

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
little bit of slack because of that but
