the past because I haven't done this so

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
the past because I haven't done this so
peel<00:00:27.240> off<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> bottom<00:00:27.840> once<00:00:28.019> you've<00:00:28.170> cut<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

peel off the bottom once you've cut it
off<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:30.320> simply<00:00:31.320> pop<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

palette

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.960 

the<00:00:41.500> easiest<00:00:41.800> method<00:00:42.190> is<00:00:42.250> actually<00:00:42.610> using

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
the easiest method is actually using

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.180 
the easiest method is actually using
surgical<00:00:43.450> spirit<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:44.470> take<00:00:44.620> on<00:00:44.740> subjects

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
surgical spirit to take on subjects

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.430 
surgical spirit to take on subjects
spirit<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.700> a<00:00:45.760> dropper<00:00:46.120> I'm<00:00:47.080> going<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.320> fill

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
spirit and a dropper I'm going to fill

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.729 
spirit and a dropper I'm going to fill
up<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.650> dropper<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.780> taking<00:00:50.140> any<00:00:50.260> eyeshadow

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
up the dropper then taking any eyeshadow

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.830 
up the dropper then taking any eyeshadow
or<00:00:50.830> blush<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:52.120> going<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.300> place<00:00:52.480> this<00:00:52.630> down

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
or blush you're going to place this down

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.420 
or blush you're going to place this down
the<00:00:52.960> sides<00:00:53.200> now<00:00:53.530> don't<00:00:53.770> worry<00:00:53.860> if<00:00:54.040> any<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.340> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
the sides now don't worry if any of the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.860 
the sides now don't worry if any of the
surgical<00:00:54.730> spirit<00:00:55.060> ends<00:00:55.420> up<00:00:55.510> on<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> eyeshadow

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
surgical spirit ends up on the eyeshadow

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.630 
surgical spirit ends up on the eyeshadow
it<00:00:56.379> really<00:00:56.620> will<00:00:56.770> not<00:00:56.890> make<00:00:57.070> any<00:00:57.340> difference

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
it really will not make any difference

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.549 
it really will not make any difference
to<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.120> eyeshadow<00:00:58.510> because<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.230> alcohol

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
to the eyeshadow because the alcohol

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.430 
to the eyeshadow because the alcohol
will<00:00:59.710> simply<00:01:00.010> evaporates<00:01:00.489> afterwards<00:01:01.440> wait

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
will simply evaporates afterwards wait

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.030 
will simply evaporates afterwards wait
for<00:01:02.620> about<00:01:02.770> 30<00:01:03.040> seconds<00:01:04.740> once<00:01:05.740> you've<00:01:05.890> done

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
for about 30 seconds once you've done

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.950 
for about 30 seconds once you've done
this<00:01:06.190> take<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.520> needle<00:01:06.760> slide<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.570> on<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.750> side

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
this take a needle slide it on the side

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.359 
this take a needle slide it on the side
of<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.170> eyeshadow<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.890> should<00:01:09.070> come<00:01:09.250> out

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
of the eyeshadow and it should come out

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:19.600 
of the eyeshadow and it should come out
just<00:01:09.610> like<00:01:09.790> that

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.039 

the<00:01:20.610> second<00:01:20.970> method<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> actually<00:01:21.450> using<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the second method is actually using a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
the second method is actually using a
lighter<00:01:22.290> now<00:01:22.829> obviously<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.060> more

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
lighter now obviously this is a lot more

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.819 
lighter now obviously this is a lot more
dangerous<00:01:24.659> than<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.990> other<00:01:25.110> method<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.649> if

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
dangerous than the other method so if

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.440 
dangerous than the other method so if
you're<00:01:25.950> underage<00:01:26.250> please<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.240> sure<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're underage please make sure that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719

you have parental permission and also be

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
you have parental permission and also be
careful<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:30.330> do<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.899> burn<00:01:31.049> your

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170

careful you do not want to burn your
house<00:01:31.289> down<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:33.390> heat<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> underside

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
house down so just heat up the underside

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630 
house down so just heat up the underside
a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.649> bit<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> peel

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
a little bit just so that you can peel

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.010 
a little bit just so that you can peel
off<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> sticker<00:01:36.149> we're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> stick

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
off the sticker we're going to stick

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.359 
off the sticker we're going to stick
this<00:01:37.140> back<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> pan<00:01:37.740> afterwards<00:01:38.220> what

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this back on the pan afterwards what

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 
this back on the pan afterwards what
we've<00:01:38.580> taken<00:01:38.789> it<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.830> problem<00:01:41.130> with

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we've taken it out now the problem with

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.380 
we've taken it out now the problem with
this<00:01:41.310> method<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.729> I'm<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> demonstrate

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this method is I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
this method is I'm going to demonstrate
it<00:01:42.929> works<00:01:43.110> better<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.530> smaller<00:01:43.799> eyeshadows

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it works better with smaller eyeshadows

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.460 
it works better with smaller eyeshadows
the<00:01:44.610> larger<00:01:45.270> eyeshadows<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> pan<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the larger eyeshadows because the pan is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
the larger eyeshadows because the pan is
so<00:01:46.619> big<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.039> doesn't<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.580> chance<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
so big it doesn't really get a chance to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
so big it doesn't really get a chance to
melt<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> glue<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> pan<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> tend<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
melt the glue and the pan can tend to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.169 
melt the glue and the pan can tend to
buckle<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.490> you'll<00:01:50.670> end<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> broken

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
buckle so you'll end up with a broken

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.510 
buckle so you'll end up with a broken
eyeshadow<00:01:51.720> brush

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
eyeshadow brush

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.740 
eyeshadow brush
