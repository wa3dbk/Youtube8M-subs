my trick is that I just kind of take the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.780 
my trick is that I just kind of take the
brush<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.570> an<00:02:41.720> angle<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.410> put<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.550> way

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.920 
that way I get a bronze and also a
contour<00:02:46.970> because<00:02:47.090> when<00:02:47.360> I'm<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.630> rush<00:02:47.810> I
