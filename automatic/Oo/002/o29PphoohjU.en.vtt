00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.819
 hi to all the guys from the name 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.990
 before tokyo ie from the undersigned good 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.519
 you all know that unfortunately in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.960
 next two weeks there will be no one 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.940
 piece so I told myself which 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 best opportunity to dust off the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 my channel also from other topics 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 other than one piece if not this one 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 and since many of you have me 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 asked both live and on my page 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 facebook that link below denim before 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.689
 the oc and an opinion just an opinion 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 on a certain manga finally today 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 after a long time, I decided to do it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.510
 first time talking about bleach 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 the tite kubo manga published by planet 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.460
 manga for several years now in Italy and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 which probably after one piece e 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.260
 naruto is the most popular and has manga 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 sold more than the last 15 years in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 the whole world beyond that needs 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
 say that it burns a bank that stands for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 so definitely finish the ending that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 is one of the fundamental parts of a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 manga will move the bar of mine 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.640
 positive or negative judgment but 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.059
 we will know this in just a few 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 month 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 for now however it is possible to give a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.010
 quite definitive picture on that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 which is still 90 percent 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 abundant in a work that is almost now 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 concluded all this of course yes 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.220
 treats of my personal opinions as 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 I always say nobody knows the truth 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 absolute let alone on youtube then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.450
 what I say like that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.220
 they say 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 maybe other youtubers who talk about 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.119
 shirt are only personal opinions 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 so take them for what they are 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.159
 having said that now I will start with mine 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.409
 sublicio opinion and first of all I want 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 dismantle what is perhaps criticism 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 main that is moved in my opinion 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.329
 unfairly to this work or blitz 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.240
 it has no history 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.820
 bleach does not have a great story here 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.079
 fuck you see this white background 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 in fact glitch behind me and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 big hand like bullshit of this 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.899
 type is so can say everything except blici 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 don't have a plot not only bleach has 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.920
 a plot but unlike other manga 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 which are much more inconclusive to a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 common thread that binds the whole plot 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.820
 from the first volume to the last this 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.829
 forum pierre may like it or not but it is 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 undeniable that the common thread of 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.380
 this is the whole story of bleach 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.200
 orange-haired boy ie 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 let's go to the protagonist ichigo kurosaki 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.770
 everything that happens english 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.200
 is directly or indirectly linked 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.030
 to the figure 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.950
 the protagonist is the element of the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.330
 predestination which is an old clichÃ© 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 like the world with regards to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.340
 showmen finds a bleach in my opinion 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.410
 of his more representations 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.959
 emblematic here I have never seen a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.970
 protagonist thus predestined as food 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.330
 to the point of being uncertain hypotheses 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.060
 I must also say quite obnoxious 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.239
 however speaking a little bit about 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.239
 characters in general I would say if 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.769
 I had to give a definition of 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.860
 this manga as a whole with a 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.080
 only adjective is that of sober 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.000
 well I guess I imagine the criticisms e 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.860
 the criticisms you will be making are but 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 how but bleach a manga above are there 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.239
 spadati there are passed there are power 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.250
 apa kat bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.470
 here also this in my opinion is a point 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.519
 very superficial view of the work 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.250
 of cube I try to explain everything better 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.110
 what happens in blitz has its own 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.910
 motivation the topic is a theme 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.610
 definitely not trivial 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.230
 or when it comes to religion and 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.810
 when talking about deaths when talking 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.840
 of spirits and so on is definitely not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.130
 easy as there are ten thousand ways 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.450
 in which this argument can be 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.090
 treaty can be treated in a manner 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.160
 gloomy can be treated so 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 satirical in an irreverent way 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.120
 here in my opinion cube has decided to 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.100
 treating precisely the theme of religion 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.190
 quite soberly 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.959
 obviously all this sobriety is also 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.480
 here it must be commensurate with the average fees of the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.920
 showmen clearly a manga intended for 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.019
 a young audience of boys 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.049
 predominantly males cannot be 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.480
 on the boobs fighting fights 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.430
 in short, things like this, however, everything 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.980
 this in my opinion at least compared to 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 other contemporary showmen is a lot 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.819
 measured the same character as 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.849
 protagonist who in some respects a bit 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.250
 the classic showman protagonist is a 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.019
 rather peculiar character ie the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.970
 food is a guy who lived by 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.340
 dramas and this is nothing strange 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.130
 in fact, we share protagonist products 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.200
 but in its relationship with others it is 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.120
 a person who generally tends to 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.680
 conceal a little bit those that are 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.180
 their emotions to the boy anyway 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.000
 brave that has perhaps above all a 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.980
 very strong sense of duty and this 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.350
 sense of duty precisely that it is a 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.870
 a little bit typical of the Japanese people 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.180
 it is often recalled during the opera 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.860
 here are the concepts of good and evil are 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.610
 concepts that are not treated 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.440
 we say so absolutely but have 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.360
 all their facets an example 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.130
 glaring just wanting to embody a 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.960
 character for this from this 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.490
 concept is that of tosan channel and that 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.590
 maybe one of my favorite characters 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.770
 which makes us understand how the concepts of good and 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.280
 badly they are relative and can be 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.570
 really very complementary here 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.060
 let's say so 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.950
 apart from that here I don't find that 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.670
 bleach is a boring manga like someone 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.040
 he says if I had to say my note for 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.540
 to criticize I want criticism 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.110
 do practical in particular to a bow 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.790
 narrative 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.410
 maybe you've already figured out what I'm up to 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.330
 speaking the true the narrative arc of the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.210
 fullbring air which I think is pure 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.640
 shit and I do not say it by the process but 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.260
 simply because in addition to the fact of 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.910
 be probably the least saga 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.180
 influential for the purposes of the plot and more 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.520
 boring in itself is also a blatant one 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.380
 copying of another saga of another 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.760
 manga and I'm talking about the sense saga 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.460
 ui hugh ghosts go 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.540
 also search maybe on wikipedia 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.160
 just to say a lot is a source 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.700
 quite reliable for this type 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.250
 of things 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.690
 the plot of the saga sense ui ju ju 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.150
 and you will see that it is practically is 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.670
 clearly the same as the full house saga 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.460
 bringer there is practically everything identical 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.070
 and obviously being cube come after 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.050
 togashi is dark that he has plagiarized 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.400
 according to me this saga then that 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.710
 saga polpen in my opinion could 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.570
 save it would save a little 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.820
 of money to us readers by buying some 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.250
 volume and less is certainly the judgment 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.140
 overall on his work would be 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.840
 better state 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.750
 wanting to talk about the design itself 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.520
 here the bleach designs can not be said 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.990
 let it be ugly let us say from the point 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.060
 in view of the graphic evolution 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.230
 stylistic in my opinion probably cube 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.390
 the author asks when he has 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.590
 started to the one in which it is now 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.450
 at present it is one of those that it is 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.490
 improved more just look at how 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.170
 drew ichigo in this volume e 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.700
 take for example the last spoilers 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.980
 who came out to figure out how much the 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.260
 cube section in these 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.620
 years has evolved regarding 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.990
 the topic of wallpapers here I wanted here 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.790
 behind me try to recreate a 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.200
 little the atmosphere that you see in the 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.090
 manga pages 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.030
 let's say this is clearly one 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.660
 choice, however, to give strong 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.490
 strong space to say to white a 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.560
 these large tables in fact 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.600
 maybe of wall backgrounds etc. this one 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.580
 it is a stylistic choice that can or 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.530
 may or may not like it here but not 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.810
 it is certainly deriving from an incapacity 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.850
 of cube in making backgrounds because 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.860
 when he draws maybe cities or others 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.720
 environments you can see very well that anyway 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.220
 he has a truly truly knowledgeable hand 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.320
 having said that nothing this is a 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.490
 my opinion on the 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.010
 bleach manga 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.660
 if I had to say maybe what the is 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.840
 my favorite character my saga 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.610
 favorite I would definitely say as a saga 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.320
 that of the solution of which I am
