00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
giving too hard to damage and I think

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
giving too hard to damage and I think
knock<00:01:27.119> back<00:01:27.390> whoever<00:01:27.900> he's<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
knock back whoever he's there and this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.160 
knock back whoever he's there and this
attack<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.549> called<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.790> clone<00:01:30.030> tactics<00:01:30.479> there

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
attack is called a clone tactics there

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
attack is called a clone tactics there
will<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.320> um<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:31.950> several<00:01:32.340> different

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
will be um I think several different

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.819 
will be um I think several different
clones<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.170> deal<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> two

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
clones and they all deal one to two

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.510 
clones and they all deal one to two
hearts<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> damage<00:01:35.280> attacking<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.520> yeah

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
hearts of damage attacking you and yeah

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's pretty awesome now if you find the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's pretty awesome now if you find the
right<00:01:40.470> clone<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.340> actually<00:01:41.579> disable

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
right clone it will actually disable

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.940 
right clone it will actually disable
that<00:01:42.329> attack<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.259> attack<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.710> oh

we go so when you're the ender soul hand

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.000 
we go so when you're the ender soul hand
if<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.600> shift<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.200> click<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.650> a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
if you shift and right click in a

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.620 
if you shift and right click in a
hundred<00:04:17.250> block<00:04:17.489> radius<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:18.030> can<00:04:18.180> teleport<00:04:18.450> to

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
hundred block radius you can teleport to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.039 
hundred block radius you can teleport to
so<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:19.739> just<00:04:19.859> teleported<00:04:20.310> there<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.049> we're

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
so we just teleported there and we're

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.770 
so we just teleported there and we're
cruisin<00:04:22.470> along<00:04:22.560> now<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.400> does<00:04:23.729> go<00:04:24.150> away<00:04:24.360> it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
cruisin along now it does go away it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.900 
cruisin along now it does go away it
does<00:04:24.960> degrade<00:04:25.140> quickly<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:26.130> I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
does degrade quickly so I

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.550 
does degrade quickly so I
watch<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.270> for<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.450> but<00:04:28.380> if<00:04:28.470> you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
watch out for that but if you

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.230 
watch out for that but if you
right-click<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.980> block<00:04:29.160> once<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:30.060> right

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
right-click a block once just right

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.750 
right-click a block once just right
click<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.540> you'll<00:04:30.900> pick<00:04:31.080> up<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.290> block<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:32.610> then

right click again and you'll throw it so

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.930 
right click again and you'll throw it so
you're<00:04:34.980> like<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.190> mutant<00:04:35.430> Enderman<00:04:35.760> pretty

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
you're like the mutant Enderman pretty

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.090 
you're like the mutant Enderman pretty
much<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:36.990> hold<00:04:37.440> down<00:04:37.530> right<00:04:37.920> click

much if you just hold down right click

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.310 
much if you just hold down right click
it<00:04:38.970> should<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:39.330> throw<00:04:39.480> automatically<00:04:40.110> so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
it should just throw automatically so

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.200 
it should just throw automatically so
that's<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.190> bit<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.430> time<00:04:41.640> saver<00:04:41.940> if<00:04:42.090> you're

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
that's a bit of a time saver if you're

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.570 
that's a bit of a time saver if you're
quick<00:04:42.450> um<00:04:42.990> guys<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.770> mod<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.220> coming<00:04:44.460> along

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
likes we might consider this for the mod

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.480 
likes we might consider this for the mod
pack<00:04:48.320> we<00:04:49.320> would<00:04:49.470> have<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.890> talk<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
pack we would have to talk to the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.890 
pack we would have to talk to the
monitor<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:50.970> he<00:04:51.180> would<00:04:51.300> obvious<00:04:51.600> have<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
monitor and he would obvious have to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.600 
monitor and he would obvious have to
finish<00:04:52.140> them<00:04:52.350> on<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.650> think<00:04:52.980> he's<00:04:53.190> still<00:04:53.370> got<00:04:53.550> it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
finish them on I think he's still got it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.100 
finish them on I think he's still got it
in<00:04:53.730> work-in-progress<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.630> we'll<00:04:54.780> wait<00:04:54.900> till

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110
