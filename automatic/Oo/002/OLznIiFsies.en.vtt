00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.980
 both ladies and gentlemen in times like these where politicians are so 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.250
 unconditionally that makes sense 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.879
 like the television one 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.099
 developed such radiance 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.940
 the media have a dermatige makes it nice to know a politician he 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.499
 says 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.499
 no more. "It's nice to have a politician 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.040
 I demand that it 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.190
 tick before 20 o'clock 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.340
 German television 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.800
 Norbert Menke 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 that means i want to kill people in front of the camera therefore 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 asked what is the suggestion 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.270
 Let's look at the great German folk poet and draftsman like Wilhelm 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.910
 bush 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.069
 Max and Moritz 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.069
 In the end, both boys fall in the mills with the file with the complaining band 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.189
 From brutal violence tied up in pictures and words 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.460
 so offered 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.370
 I agree with them completely 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.670
 Percent as given earlier 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.730
 There are many other examples giving us humans 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.300
 four divisions 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.840
 Forbid fashion on TV before 8pm 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.869
 it's okay 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.260
 but what about 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 for september 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.730
 that is 59 clock German time happened as in the afternoon what to tell 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.700
 Children until 8pm 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 we have to look a little bit straight from a government agency 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 they do not want television or Christy Turlington 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.550
 of course, have the overall responsibility 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.610
 the overall responsibility 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.440
 Here the politicians understand that Â«I have to stop 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 I am Fahad al-Sabah my children are included but they must 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.750
 For that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 because they are rarely at home as politicians targeted attacks at home 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.980
 in front of the TV and when they're not at home percent and and around 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.190
 her children in the meantime only nine thirty-nine to my wife and I are there 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.100
 always his would 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 They are happy to continue this gap in London 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.039
 no TV makers more before 20 clock 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.519
 that was simply too and that was not the case
