 no 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.150
 hello everyone and welcome to the bag i 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.640
 musical instruments are Stefano and today 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.620
 I'm in the company of my musician friend 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.470
 marco porcu a renowned musician 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.510
 international present on youtube with 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.400
 numerous videos of extraordinary quality 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.050
 that I invite you to see 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.290
 they are really musical pieces 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.050
 extraordinary and we also mark today 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.269
 the pleasure of presenting you an instrument 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.690
 in our opinion it is interesting 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.190
 of a guitar of the brand furka un 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.789
 European brand the model and the 20 cm s 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.890
 is a very spartan jumbo guitar from 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.160
 aesthetic point of view perhaps it is true 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.140
 however you receive marco with this is the card 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.630
 characters even take a center from 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.369
 act as a jumbo when it comes to yellow 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.490
 we speak of low mbe bombe low that 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.200
 they fall from the sky and therefore also into 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.909
 in fact, this case is not denied 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.330
 because things about races really do 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.530
 exaggerated at the level of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.530
 just passed me to something 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.140
 you really feel the vibration even on the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.740
 chest gets powerful on all frequencies 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.370
 but with this emphasis emphasis on 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.290
 low frequencies is an instrument with a 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.080
 table in cedar bottom and bundles the mundane 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.340
 the rosewood fretboard the guitar is 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.930
 bang rock save jan bang a massive 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.160
 amplified is amplified internally 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.020
 it does not naturally have scarce bands 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.180
 here from stock exchanges since I'm a bit 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.700
 picky level guitars 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.260
 if they are amplified we say I try not to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.200
 take them with preamps that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.700
 they go to ruin part of the wood 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.230
 fundamental generating on the guitar 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.120
 which of course 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.239
 in short I would say a pleasant guitar 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.830
 so simple fun guitar 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.810
 also useful to be used in 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.790
 different applications a tool 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 however versatile and powerful 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.300
 we really just have to greet you that 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.760
 in liquid life, stock exchanges on the way 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.550
 massarenti number 6 a bologna thanks 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.810
