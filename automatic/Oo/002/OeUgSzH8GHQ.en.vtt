well Kevin let me guess with all these
extension<00:00:12.300> cords<00:00:12.570> laying<00:00:12.809> around<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.469> bet

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
extension cords laying around here I bet

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.680 
extension cords laying around here I bet
a<00:00:13.740> question<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.490> extension<00:00:15.059> cord<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.420> not

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
a question on extension cord it's not

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.930 
a question on extension cord it's not
yep<00:00:16.500> they<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.800> wrote<00:00:17.130> us<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> they<00:00:17.520> said<00:00:17.730> how

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
do I avoid this tangled mess at the end

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.439 
do I avoid this tangled mess at the end
of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> day<00:00:20.820> when<00:00:21.029> they've<00:00:21.150> done<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of the day when they've done with the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.630 
of the day when they've done with the
courts<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.740> say<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> cord

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
courts well I would say that that cord

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340 
courts well I would say that that cord
was<00:00:23.880> wound<00:00:24.210> too<00:00:24.510> tight<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.199> all

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
was wound too tight and there's all

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.170 
was wound too tight and there's all
kinds<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.769> gadgets<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
kinds of gadgets out there that do that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
kinds of gadgets out there that do that
gadgets<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.039> coil<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.519> this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
gadgets like this and a coil like this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
gadgets like this and a coil like this
is<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.990> look<00:00:31.590> at<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> put

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is one I don't like look at when you put

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.139 
is one I don't like look at when you put
the<00:00:32.250> cord<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.730> there

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the cord on there

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.760 
the cord on there
really<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> wind<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.680> how

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
really when you wind it up look at how

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.670 
really when you wind it up look at how
tight<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.210> when<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> unwind<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.500> it's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
tight that is so when you unwind it it's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.830 
tight that is so when you unwind it it's
created<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.309> memory<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> cord<00:00:39.329> won't<00:00:39.540> lay

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
created a memory that the cord won't lay

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
created a memory that the cord won't lay
flat<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.500> floor<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.070> bound<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.640> like

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
flat on the floor it's all bound up like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.290 
flat on the floor it's all bound up like
a<00:00:41.879> spring

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
a spring

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
a spring
and<00:00:42.719> also<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.399> cause<00:00:44.670> some

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and also it can do it can cause some

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.069 
and also it can do it can cause some
damage<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> wire

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
damage to the wire

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260 
damage to the wire
people<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:46.980> plug<00:00:47.340> their<00:00:47.640> cords<00:00:48.090> together

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
people will plug their cords together

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
people will plug their cords together
like<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> look<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.620> puts<00:00:49.980> stress<00:00:50.100> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like that and look at it puts stress on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
like that and look at it puts stress on
it<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:50.910> damaging<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> wire<00:00:51.960> inside

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it right there damaging the wire inside

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
it right there damaging the wire inside
there<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> here's<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.309> no<00:00:53.640> no<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> don't

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there and here's another no no we don't

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.639 
there and here's another no no we don't
want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> ever<00:00:54.600> store<00:00:54.960> these<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.320> tape

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
want to ever store these with tape

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.350 
want to ever store these with tape
because<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> leave<00:00:56.520> glue<00:00:56.789> behind<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
because this can leave glue behind and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.869 
because this can leave glue behind and
we<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.570> want<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> cord<00:00:58.320> mm-hmm

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
we don't want that on the cord mm-hmm

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.950 
we don't want that on the cord mm-hmm
