00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
would go burger I was a phenomenon at a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.199 
would go burger I was a phenomenon at a
time<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.950> Goldberg<00:02:32.489> gimmick<00:02:32.790> wouldn't<00:02:33.060> work

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
time a Goldberg gimmick wouldn't work

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.940 
time a Goldberg gimmick wouldn't work
today<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.780> we've<00:02:33.930> seen<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.650> I'm<00:02:34.770> not
