 these are all my search albums 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 Northeastern Brazil has a time when I 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.389
 I wanted to hear about anything else when 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.250
 to finish dancing was xotexaxado baiana 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 rain 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.560
 Let's see, that's what they played in your 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 pajama party on disk scratched like this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 No, I'm a little new, but this record 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.309
 here must be almost my age and I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 I think it 's from the 40's but you just heard 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.739
 This in the time of Saint John 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.250
 which of the day and I always gives you a space 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.410
 Photo landing 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:59.149
 I think it's still too much for me, right? 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.960
 come here I followed my rhythm and stay 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.930
 optimistic, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:15.290
 and you know that in the northeast it's even more 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.290
 when is the crucible forró is the chat will be 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 much while in the forró you accompany the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 pace together in the crash or come to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 back to back to those rhythms 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.650
 Northeast has existed for more than one hundred years 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 then did rock mixes come 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 all you dance there that we do not even 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.530
 Can you tell what it is to dance forró? 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 It's taken time, we 'll pass. 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 This I think Flemish did not try 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.980
 You also saw this in a store. 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.340
 of discs 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.040
 It is because there was not many and baião 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.610
 but the types or another thousand meters of 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.850
 and sell more than usual against 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.380
 How was the party yesterday at the party? 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.220
 pajamas invited me to dance 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.270
 gang 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.670
 Mauricio invited me to his father. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.730
 I paid the monkey he pulls me to dance. 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.310
 and soon afterwards it scared me 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.120
 the kits are good, we started to give the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 his footsteps shouted in my ear and I is 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 who goes or sideways and I started to scream 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.490
 the other girls also shouted more 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.920
 because this is part of the dance 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.020
 but then I do not understand why you think 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.660
 who pays the monkey with what I thought 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.880
 There was even a snake in the party. 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.470
 while everyone went back to the forró 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.030
 I kept yelling I asked for a monkey 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.270
 So it's getting ready that we're going 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.820

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.580

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.380

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.670

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.490
