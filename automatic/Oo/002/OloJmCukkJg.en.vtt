drowns them in shochu which is basically

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
drowns them in shochu which is basically
like<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> slightly<00:00:57.449> lower<00:00:57.690> alcohol<00:00:57.989> version<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

vodka and then he seals them up for
three<00:01:01.350> years<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.250> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> hang

wasps are said to release a toxin as

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
wasps are said to release a toxin as
they<00:01:08.820> die<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.840> fermented

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
they die which will then be fermented
