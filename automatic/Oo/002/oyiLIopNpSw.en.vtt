so<00:01:15.720> there's<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.140> golf<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> buffer<00:01:18.210> up

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so there's some golf with that buffer up

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
so there's some golf with that buffer up
it<00:01:18.450> does<00:01:18.600> take<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> few<00:01:19.080> seconds<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it does take a few seconds for it to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.050 
it does take a few seconds for it to
catch<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> quality<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> improve

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
catch up and for the quality to improve

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.600 
catch up and for the quality to improve
but<00:01:24.060> once<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> gets<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.530> looks<00:01:25.890> pretty

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but once it gets going it looks pretty

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.069 
but once it gets going it looks pretty
good<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.740> let<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.770> load<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:30.890> there<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> go

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
good so let that load up there we go

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
good so let that load up there we go
zoom<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> second<00:01:43.939> all<00:01:44.939> right

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
zoom in on that for a second all right

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
zoom in on that for a second all right
not<00:01:45.180> too<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.509> action<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.110> golf<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
can see that the quality is pretty good

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.340

look<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.930> little<00:03:09.170> jagged<00:03:09.769> here<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.220> graphics

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
look a little jagged here the graphics

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.979 
look a little jagged here the graphics
look<00:03:11.420> very<00:03:12.160> pixelated<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:14.209> once<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.780> load<00:03:14.959> up

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
look very pixelated but once you load up

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.720 
look very pixelated but once you load up
some<00:03:15.350> content<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.950> video<00:03:16.220> looks<00:03:16.459> actually

some content the video looks actually

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090 
some content the video looks actually
pretty<00:03:17.660> decent<00:03:17.840> here<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:18.739> definitely

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
pretty decent here so it's definitely

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.940
