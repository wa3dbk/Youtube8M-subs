you can access the inside of the case

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.240 
you can access the inside of the case
fairly<00:04:13.239> easily<00:04:13.720> I'll<00:04:14.380> have<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> lot<00:04:14.890> more<00:04:15.070> on

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
fairly easily I'll have a lot more on

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.230 
fairly easily I'll have a lot more on
this<00:04:15.370> product<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.880> an<00:04:16.150> upcoming<00:04:16.269> video<00:04:16.660> review
