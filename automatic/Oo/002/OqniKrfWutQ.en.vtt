that German can strike teams are not

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.210 
that German can strike teams are not
check<00:01:47.360> they<00:01:48.020> do<00:01:48.080> not<00:01:48.260> take<00:01:48.410> a<00:01:48.470> serious<00:01:48.920> book

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
check they do not take a serious book

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.060 
check they do not take a serious book
game<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.620> think<00:01:51.680> there's<00:01:51.950> a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
game so do you think there's a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.210 
game so do you think there's a
difference<00:01:52.250> between<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.450> countries<00:01:54.220> there's

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
difference between the countries there's

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.890 
difference between the countries there's
always<00:01:55.550> different<00:01:55.730> between<00:01:56.150> conscious<00:01:56.750> and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
always different between conscious and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.670 
always different between conscious and
people<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:59.260> think<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:02.180> can<00:02:02.360> also<00:02:02.660> say<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
people I think you can also say that to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.640 
people I think you can also say that to
about<00:02:04.460> polish<00:02:05.030> people<00:02:05.450> because<00:02:05.720> there's<00:02:05.960> lots

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
about polish people because there's lots

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.250 
about polish people because there's lots
of<00:02:06.860> good<00:02:07.460> players<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.450> are<00:02:08.540> not<00:02:08.660> taking

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
of good players that they are not taking

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.230 
of good players that they are not taking
the<00:02:09.290> game<00:02:09.530> seriously<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.280> even<00:02:10.910> though<00:02:11.030> they

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
the game seriously and even though they

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.060 
the game seriously and even though they
are<00:02:11.300> spending<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.840> lot<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.020> time<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> game

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
are spending a lot of time on the game

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.220 
are spending a lot of time on the game
they<00:02:13.370> don't<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.360> any<00:02:14.510> tactics<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
they don't want to do any tactics so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.790 
they don't want to do any tactics so
it's<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.590> guess<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.160> same<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.590> if<00:02:18.590> you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's I guess it's the same so if you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.460 
it's I guess it's the same so if you
just<00:02:18.950> want<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> achieve<00:02:20.120> anything<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.840> just

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
just want to achieve anything you just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.250 
just want to achieve anything you just
