00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.620
 which welcome my life to you 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.139
 a new video of me 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.290
 Today I want to make a mousse and 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.820
 though an amaretto schoko mousse yes me 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.890
 I'm very curious if I succeed 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.140
 because afterwards I have to say 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.750
 and I 'll be there first 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.239
 cream beat 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 so what thumbs it expresses mine 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.820
 absolute premiere we will see if it is 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.220
 succeed so our we abuse it 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.469
 only 200 grams did chocolate again 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.070
 broken into pieces I have already 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.489
 here 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.929
 you can also give blogs survey me 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.070
 have time later chocolate 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.629
 took 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.500
 we have to open that first second 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.500
 stage 10 crushed 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.670
 that looks good as well 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:13.210
 next we need four eggs 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:13.210
 they come now to our amaretto 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:32.480
 so what can coffee now see 20 grams 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.550
 steiger coffee I have it here 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.270
 coffee from our fully automatic coffee machine 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.270
 let out 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.560
 he is always nice when you are 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.480
 like that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 so that 's it for the first time 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.650
 we should now five minutes 50 degrees 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.650
 Stage 4 of mission 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.939
 you see there's a lot of it 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.289
 injected 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.579
 Suddenly stepped off a bit and 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.579
 let it run again purely 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:21.590
 well, a pity about the delicious I have to 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.880
 will also again a bit in 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.130
 mixed if the chocolate under scratch 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.220
 that's all nice again down there because 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:37.040
 now there's something else to come and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.620
 Although 50 grams of soft butter in little flakes 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 so here I have tried it myself 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:53.630
 the flakes too small pieces but it 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:56.890
 fits the lid back on and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.390
 that should be another ten seconds 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.390
 stir at level 3 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.230
 Now we do not want to finish it 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.829
 because the cream is still missing in one 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.049
 bowl oven cold 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.370
 because they have to do it now 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.250
 we clean the mix head very well 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.680
 because I have already heard if you just 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.049
 still a little droplet somehow fed 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 in mixed ob, the cream would not have 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.709
 so stiff I do not know how 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.269
 It's my career 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.370
 For the first time I will now 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.450
 take jobs so in the appointment and I 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.450
 I'm really curious if I can do that 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.450
 you are live 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.349
 yes, as I said so the mass now 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.500
 refrigerate 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:58.880
 Clean with spox nice and then 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.980
 Let's make love again what 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.239
 fast forward I have my mixed ob 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.040
 cleaned and I still have it 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.980
 asked five minutes in the refrigerator 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.810
 so that he is nice and cold 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.940
 butterfly tower I also had in the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.090
 refrigerator of 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.660
 insert terminus turn on who as 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.630
 quite helpful and now come 52 grams 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:39.130
 So cream or we 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:39.130
 need 250 grams things were not like that 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.080
 Here we make the lid on ours 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.760
 max creeks but also give the wrong order 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.620
 that fits so it looks like in the 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.120
 Give cold mix pot and up to 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.000
 The desired strength is stiff 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.130
 Stage 3 So good you always should 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.940
 keep eye contact I'll start now 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.940
 at level 3 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.930
 So I think that they where material from 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:45.400
 So, as I said, I made it that way 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:50.110
 believe it was a minute now 40 times 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.360
 thumb level 3 but as I said it comes 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.520
 always on how hold your cream 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.140
 how cold it is a mix pot and so on 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.870
 and so on, and therefore always 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:04.420
 look in and as soon as you see that the 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.990
 cream yes sun to the imprint of this 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.510
 is formed at the edge of butterfly 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.040
 actually proud 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.870
 now we have the choice as here below 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:22.030
 our US muscle the flood protection same 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:27.460
 Giving out will do that and then how 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:29.200
 said very well let the cool 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.420
 I'm going to make a good cutie 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 by cooling 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.290
 I'll probably be the same soon 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.280
 I can never taste myself there 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.680
 restrain 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:44.080
 Schlecker Munich and then I will 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:51.910
 present you my final result 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:55.150
 and I hope that tastes like mine 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:58.710
 I live here now have just returned from the 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.790
 asparagus already made a bit 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.280
 although they are not right through 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.050
 According to the recipe, chilled is three 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.740
 hours in the fridge 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.050
 let cool 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.180
 just tastes super gigantic 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:16.610
 the amaretto does not come that way yet 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:21.669
 doll out more chocolate but still one 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:24.770
 poem and homemade without a packet 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.110
 really great because you know at least something 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.370
 in it is 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.699
 I would like to again later 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.699
 equal
