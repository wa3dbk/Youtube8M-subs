00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
you can actually put this in an Xbox 360

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.350 
you can actually put this in an Xbox 360
and<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.950> will<00:05:51.100> upscale<00:05:51.640> it<00:05:51.970> not<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.240> mention

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
and it will upscale it not to mention

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.850 
and it will upscale it not to mention
the<00:05:52.510> math<00:05:52.600> of<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:52.900> already<00:05:53.290> actually<00:05:53.560> has<00:05:53.830> a

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
the math of this already actually has a

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.110 
the math of this already actually has a
little<00:05:54.010> bit<00:05:54.130> better<00:05:54.220> graphics<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.060> an

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
little bit better graphics and an

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.000 
little bit better graphics and an
alternate<00:05:55.570> ending<00:05:55.720> so<00:05:56.080> definitely<00:05:56.470> if<00:05:56.830> you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
alternate ending so definitely if you

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.100 
alternate ending so definitely if you
can<00:05:57.220> track<00:05:57.850> down<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.150> Xbox<00:05:58.540> version<00:05:58.660> and

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
can track down the Xbox version and

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.180 
can track down the Xbox version and
