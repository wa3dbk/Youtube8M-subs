playstation eye looks for the seventy

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.770 
playstation eye looks for the seventy
eight<00:00:50.219> millimeter<00:00:50.640> ball<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> based<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
eight millimeter ball and based on the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
eight millimeter ball and based on the
fact<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> does<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.590> baby<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.190> X

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fact that it does is that baby this X

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
fact that it does is that baby this X
number<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.910> pixels<00:00:54.120> wide<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.690> exactly

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
number of pixels wide I know exactly

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.920 
number of pixels wide I know exactly
i'll<00:00:55.199> photostream<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> move<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
i'll photostream so the move is going to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.639 
i'll photostream so the move is going to
give<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.350> only<00:00:58.579> x<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.090> y<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.050> z

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
give you not only x and y but also z

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.340 
give you not only x and y but also z
which<00:01:02.100> apparently<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.579> challenging<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> some

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
which apparently is challenging for some

which apparently is challenging for some
platforms<00:01:04.700> we<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> i

kicked my own demo so this right here is
another<00:02:48.860> simple<00:02:49.310> calibration<00:02:49.819> it's<00:02:50.180> just

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
another simple calibration it's just

making sure that i didn't put one of the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.050 
making sure that i didn't put one of the
moves<00:02:51.800> comments<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> coffee<00:02:52.550> table<00:02:52.730> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
moves comments on the coffee table I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.339 
moves comments on the coffee table I
just<00:02:53.239> put<00:02:53.390> them<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.660> same<00:02:53.840> vicinity<00:02:54.110> of

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
just put them in the same vicinity of

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.150 
just put them in the same vicinity of
one<00:02:54.530> another<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.380> go<00:02:57.500> put<00:02:57.950> them<00:02:58.069> to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
one another there we go put them to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.530 
one another there we go put them to
cydia<00:02:58.489> one<00:02:58.610> another<00:02:58.760> press<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> move<00:02:59.330> button

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
cydia one another press the move button

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.800 
cydia one another press the move button
now<00:02:59.720> knows<00:02:59.989> they're<00:03:00.200> either<00:03:00.410> both<00:03:00.650> my<00:03:00.980> hands

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
now knows they're either both my hands

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.360 
now knows they're either both my hands
so<00:03:02.810> again<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.319> play<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.739> bunch<00:03:04.280> of

so again I can play as a bunch of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.070 
so again I can play as a bunch of
different<00:03:04.489> characters<00:03:04.849> here<00:03:05.209> next<00:03:05.750> part<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.019> a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
different characters here next part of a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.320 
different characters here next part of a
bladder<00:03:06.530> duel<00:03:06.799> is<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.519> shows<00:03:07.700> off<00:03:08.150> the
