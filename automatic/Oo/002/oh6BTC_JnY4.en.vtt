more there and kind of skipped some of
the<00:00:42.550> things<00:00:42.730> born<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.090> do<00:00:43.239> in<00:00:43.300> Honduras

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
the things born to do in Honduras

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.569 
the things born to do in Honduras
because<00:00:44.050> we<00:00:44.200> want<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.440> go<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.860> Bay<00:00:45.040> Islands

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
because we want to go to the Bay Islands

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.940 
because we want to go to the Bay Islands
and<00:00:46.360> we<00:00:46.510> decided<00:00:46.840> instead<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.350> spend<00:00:47.770> our

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
and we decided instead to spend our

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.160 
and we decided instead to spend our
money<00:00:47.980> on<00:00:48.460> flying<00:00:49.180> out<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.570> corn<00:00:49.809> islands

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
money on flying out to the corn islands

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.660 
money on flying out to the corn islands
and<00:00:50.290> Nicaragua<00:00:50.770> but<00:00:50.890> would<00:00:51.160> like<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.340> go<00:00:51.520> back

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
and Nicaragua but would like to go back

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.580 
and Nicaragua but would like to go back
and<00:00:51.880> see<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.120> Bay<00:00:52.239> Islands<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:52.870> think

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
and see the Bay Islands I think

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.410 
and see the Bay Islands I think
conjurer's<00:00:54.070> gets<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.309> reward<00:00:54.700> for<00:00:54.820> reputation

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
conjurer's gets a reward for reputation

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.030 
conjurer's gets a reward for reputation
when<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.600> comes<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.930> safety<00:00:56.350> but<00:00:56.559> I<00:00:56.829> would

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
when it comes to safety but I would

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.380 
when it comes to safety but I would
really<00:00:57.190> like<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.550> go<00:00:57.640> back<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:58.000> think<00:00:58.180> there<00:00:58.270> are

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
really like to go back I think there are

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.760 
really like to go back I think there are
some<00:00:58.480> hidden<00:00:58.660> gems<00:00:59.020> there<00:00:59.260> are<00:00:59.469> fewer

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
some hidden gems there are fewer

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.260 
some hidden gems there are fewer
tourists<00:01:00.160> because<00:01:00.489> people<00:01:00.850> do<00:01:00.969> think<00:01:01.149> it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
tourists because people do think it's

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.720 
tourists because people do think it's
less<00:01:01.420> safe<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.800> probably<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.340> but

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
less safe and it probably is but

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.789 
less safe and it probably is but
definitely<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.540> copan<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:04.960> felt<00:01:05.170> safe<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.680> it

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
definitely in copan we felt safe and it

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.690 
definitely in copan we felt safe and it
was<00:01:05.890> totally<00:01:06.250> normal

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
was totally normal

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.599 
was totally normal
we<00:01:06.969> did<00:01:07.119> spend<00:01:07.329> a<00:01:07.420> night<00:01:07.569> in<00:01:07.600> Tegucigalpa

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.239 
we did spend a night in Tegucigalpa
which<00:01:09.609> isn't<00:01:09.850> really<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.359> pleasant<00:01:10.630> city<00:01:11.249> we've

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249

which isn't really a pleasant city we've
kind<00:01:12.429> of<00:01:12.520> spent<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.759> night<00:01:12.909> there<00:01:13.119> in<00:01:13.209> order<00:01:13.359> to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
kind of spent a night there in order to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.389 
kind of spent a night there in order to
move<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.499> because<00:01:14.649> we<00:01:14.829> had<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.039> make<00:01:15.159> our<00:01:15.369> way
