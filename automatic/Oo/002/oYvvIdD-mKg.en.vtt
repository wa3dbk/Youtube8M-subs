first<00:01:32.610> taped<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
first taped it because we got it as a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
first taped it because we got it as a
mystery<00:01:34.560> juice<00:01:34.770> without<00:01:34.950> labels<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> stuff<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
mystery juice without labels and stuff I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.200 
mystery juice without labels and stuff I
thought<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.360> junior<00:01:36.689> bread<00:01:37.159> hey<00:01:38.180> there<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
thought it was junior bread hey there I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
thought it was junior bread hey there I
at<00:01:39.509> first<00:01:39.750> impressions<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.439> thought<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> was

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
at first impressions I thought it was

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
at first impressions I thought it was
Gingerbread<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.299> wait<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
Gingerbread and then I was like wait I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.929 
Gingerbread and then I was like wait I
was<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.399> Cinnabon

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
was like I think this is Cinnabon

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.609 
was like I think this is Cinnabon
because<00:01:45.270> I've<00:01:45.420> never<00:01:45.450> had<00:01:45.840> cinnabon<00:01:46.229> before

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
because I've never had cinnabon before

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
because I've never had cinnabon before
so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> couldn't<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.610> finger<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so I couldn't really put my finger on it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.350 
so I couldn't really put my finger on it
but<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:49.130> really<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.430> i'm<00:01:50.610> impressed<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.329> a
