00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 U 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:12.620
 The capital of the Republic of Korea 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.480
 Now, not only quantitative growth but also the need for Seoul's 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.400
 It is time. 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.400
 I look forward to a new future city procession to have better value 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:33.040
 April 2013 115 Park Won-soon The mayor of Seoul is a systematic and ongoing 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.030
 Announces Urban Planning for Development 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.350
 It's a long-term coherent from now on . 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.980
 Based on systematic and future insights 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 Based on our reflection on our lives 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.710
 City planning should begin. 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:58.100
 Sudo Seoul is a city that has developed tremendous development and expansion, 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.920
 It became a global city in organic 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 But there are values ​​that have been shaded in development 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.380
 Seoul is beautiful in history and nature 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.280
 It's a valuable asset that we've received. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.509
 So far, many people have thought of this as a crop. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:25.020
 It's not water, it's a resource, but in a short time. 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 Focus on responding to changes in the external environment or changes in demand now 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 It's a demand-oriented city. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 The Future City of Future City 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 For example, if you live in a human-centered city or a community-centered city or 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.090
 City Historical and Cultural City with Accounting Competitiveness What is a Sustainable City 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 Set your vision 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 I did not plan and prepare the city . 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 30 The slope has stopped at the mountain. It is a city of outstanding natural beauty, but as you can see, 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 The building has been hiding in the forest and its value has been undermined. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:11.290
 Many cultural people living in Seoul are being ignored everywhere. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.189
 So we start to worry about the new future city ​​plan 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.450
 The city government decided in 2013 to the suburbs to the city of the future first year 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:22.120
 Restoring the value that has been neglected in the past , 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.599
 We are preparing to make it. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.150
 Each a facility was centered on facilities that were more people-oriented people 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:38.040
 I'm trying to decorate the center. 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.040
 So you can see this is a hardware plan, not a hardware plan. 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.840
 Seoul has consistently and systematically flexible 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:49.530
 We have held dozens of meetings and briefing sessions to create a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.530
 Held 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:01.310
 The resulting urban management paradigm of Seoul 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.310
 Maintenance and Regeneration Growth and distribution are emphasizing the fungus community and people 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.580
 In the past, there was a lot of people, 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.680
 Yesterday's development Recently, this part is more profitable than the perspective of someone's life 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:22.200
 In addition to such a process point of view did little worthy of a man and parts 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 Some growth -oriented developments have led to some companies, history, 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.840
 Our natural environment 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:34.970
 Who are the most valuable people in your judgment that you are a little short on these parts ? 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.200
 The value of being human is the history and the natural environment and I will be the two of them. 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.500
 The city ​​plans to formulate a city plan for the next 100 years 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.500
 Fields. 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:53.940
 First of all, Seoul City Planning, which will become the gravity principle and standard of Seoul City Planning, 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:58.170
 2030 Seoul Plan prepared by the Urban Master Plan is scheduled to be established by the end of the year 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:03.930
 Next sophisticated cities 5 dormitory bath Seoul for the planning process and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 By the end of 2015 in the life braiding plan divided into three metropolitan centers and five metropolitan centers 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.830
 It's done. 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.600
 It is included in the process of establishing a sophisticated scheme of one-sided bottle and historic city management plan. 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.260
 There is 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.480
 In addition, to prevent problems caused by the intense development 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:25.710
 A land management system is established for the people and the environment. 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.280
 Projects to be carried out on major sites are subject to steady public 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.540
 Finally, cooperative governance that draws citizen participation 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.680
 Cooperative governance is a way of being citizen participation type 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:42.630
 It contains a wider-scale corrective philosophy 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:47.520
 To do this, we organize the participation of residents who listen to citizens' opinions on living relations. 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:52.050
 Create and run a collaborative team for permanent consultation 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.060
 This is what the citizens of Seoul time be on the future 100 years of the city of Seoul owner 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.890
 City planning. 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:04.290
 I think a good citizen fits a good city. 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:09.300
 We fully Seoul so far contains only two came good, 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:16.530
 Oh, just to go one step further than this 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:21.470
 Uh, like when striking the city a lot of time thinking about it and achieved a citizen 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.470
 I think Mr. Eder can go a step further and develop. 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:33.630
 The city of Seoul has been interested in the value 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:38.790
 We have just taken the first step to create a Seoul where people's cultural environment takes precedence . 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.350
 In the meantime, we are waiting for citizen's participation and interest. 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:46.670
 Future changes in Seoul nice city 100 years to create a good citizen, 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.670
 It starts from now 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.810
 Next 2 hours 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.920
 Dong 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.700
 People live together 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:17.580
 To recover the community about lack wants to continue to live as a man, John Pause 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:17.580
 We build a village and support the conditions and activities of the people.
