00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.080
 geo say the dopeul is actually it's 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.170
 we will say each class to his open 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 that is, there are 15 open which 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 annoyed 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.969
 for example the time that the zobal the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.800

 for example for the butler 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.370
 so fear where you need to activate 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.140
 this quest 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899

 and yes you will buy departures 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 way there are little by chaumet or

 even parchments of great parchments 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 powerful parchment for the for 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.280
 go and sell them all 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 simply at the hotel selling the shares 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 way here is the band going now that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.310
 I do not care 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.020
 here you go to sell them so here you go 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.649
 it make you kamas more xp 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.689
 of course after to the thiais techniques 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.619
 but sure well known but who walks who 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 walking that works 1 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.850
 it is the offer in gold or put channel 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.329
 commerce and a meteor buys offer in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.479
 gold you put your sum of kamako 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.659
 wanted for example I'm a million five 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.289
 available hop you wait only 15 mpxl 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.970
 military pelichet you will see the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.290
 good price his advisers she's going to them 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.270
 see apart if you too you there 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.280
 really know you're going to see the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.569
 hdv price of the item for example if x 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.750
 you will see the price the headdress the jet 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.510
 and you will try to buy the item 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.220
 that the character proposes you to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.780
 lower is possible to sell them 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 the most expensive possible so to make the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.470
 profit 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.430
 is the goal in this story it will 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.349
 to be making a profit 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.940
 for example you will buy a 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.400
 headdress family still resale family 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.340
 in 2003 put in four for example 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.849
 400 to 1200 1300 and 1400 miles camatte 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.590
 earnings 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.000
 that's really a lot 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.540
 a lot a lot you to bring 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.849
 this technique after there is the famous 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.209
 technique is simply going to 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.790
 worker and so that's for example 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:05.700
 to set up a job somewhere else 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.470
 peasants jeweler good month for me my 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.120
 favorite are the kraft crafts that's 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.610
 to say besides jeweler shoemaker 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.110
 that I have not yet but a good farmer 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 report very well I have a technique 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.519
 alex peasants is you going to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.040
 so what are you going for chili 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.810
 he risks by coming very well the 125 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.379
 the 100 risk units will sell 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.879
 shown sitting dear on my c9000 server 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.220
 kama leaving so that could be 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.510
 really very profitable so here is a 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.159
 little technique here again had 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 get them to mow rice and sell 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.909
 places like that without making flour 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.930
 would go in fact if the alchemists I 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.209
 think they bought or made 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.170
 Poupaud potions and potions to pop 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.540
 black rock and good you simply 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 here is after there is a body with curtain 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.239
 lead who is not funny chord table 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.310
 heat that is already suffering this is it may 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.900
 buy tickets here pebbles 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.420
 because now the pebbles since 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.960
 the points match 10 that's really it 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 really serves everywhere at that 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.580
 webb has been able to leave to some that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.340
 good po trophy short it'll have to 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.870
 buy no i have nothing nada 3 follow her 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.580
 in calm it of auckland 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.880
 they must then be quite expensive 3,500 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.930
 miles but it's not very profitable it 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.730
 you do not sell small parchment 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.690
 so here we can see illegal sticking 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.240
 and it really does a lot 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.010
 said she but no so that's the same 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.470
 it goes really fast here for 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.170
 do fujitsu caps like that item 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.000
 task so here it goes 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.610
 really very very very very fast 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.350
 so that's all for these little ones 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.150
 techniques so I summarize for the for 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.710
 the open eads technique you go into 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030
 a dopeul array no need to go 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.280
 in 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.470
 in the temple of your class you 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
 activate the quest this the 15 open you 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.400
 go buy after the little parchment 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.140
 of xp or large and medium and 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.420
 what do you want to hop to 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.280
 resell and the kids so for you 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.350
 can do the opel every twelve 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.020
 hours I think short you can them 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.970
 do it every day and in any case 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.800
 the more it brings you xp and ben 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.970
 that's all for this for these 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.070
 small techniques I hope that you 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.460
 will have more subscribe to the channel that me 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.210
