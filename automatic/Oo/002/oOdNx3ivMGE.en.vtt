00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920 
green was getting too wide so it kind of
absorbed<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.790> he<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.060> standing<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
absorbed in as he was standing in it and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
absorbed in as he was standing in it and
what<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.680> did<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.670> D<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
what we did was we use the D like the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
what we did was we use the D like the
zeros<00:02:03.930> decoy<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> stick

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
zeros decoy to kind of get them to stick

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
zeros decoy to kind of get them to stick
in<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.790> spot<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.450> minute<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:07.290> use<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
in that spot for a minute we use the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.309 
in that spot for a minute we use the
turret<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.220> he<00:02:08.310> tries<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.729> fight<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.170> we

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
turret so he tries to fight that and we

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.300 
turret so he tries to fight that and we
also<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.129> implosion<00:02:11.550> grenades

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
also use the implosion grenades

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.000 
also use the implosion grenades
the<00:02:13.150> ones<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.420> sucky<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.500> throw<00:02:14.890> them

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the ones that sucky and we throw them

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
the ones that sucky and we throw them
