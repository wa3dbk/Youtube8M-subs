 three and a half centimeters, it is almost like that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.470

 gb ssd little space for photos 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.320

 can the schenker notebook 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 easily with two more hard disks 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 or ssds retrofit connections are there 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 every amount two displayports one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.280
 display has a 17.3 inches 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 screen diagonal and showed in the test 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 all games and videos crisp hot 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.680
 The resolution is 1920 x 1080 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 picture points the colors are unfortunately 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 this is a bit pale 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 display anti-reflective annoying 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.810
 There are no reflections here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 Work and play pace was consistently 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 very high even in full hd with high 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 detail rendering brings the xmg in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.299
 cut just under 70 pictures per second 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.950
 on the display 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.170
 so the notebook is still for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.270
 upcoming games from caliber battlefield 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.460
 hotline fast enough the battery power 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.040
 did not particularly convince in the test 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.549
 after 2 hours and 46 minutes was 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.740
 ending 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.430
 but after all, the battery was already after 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.679
 two hours fully charged again 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.330
 as long as you do not keep the notebook constantly 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.770
 wants to carry in the backpack and with it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.450
 can make friends with the power cable 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.310
 actually always have to have it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.700
 you can really get a lot for it here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.520
 money 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.490
 because the main task is the game 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 that masters the schenker p 705 with 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.850
 Bravery
