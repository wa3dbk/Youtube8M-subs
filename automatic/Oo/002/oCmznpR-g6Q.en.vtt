YouTube no we're not continuing that no
and<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.560> feathery<00:01:15.920> part

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
and then this is the the feathery part

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.730 
and then this is the the feathery part
is<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:16.700> paper<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.570> actually<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:18.230> he<00:01:18.500> would

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
is just paper and actually what he would

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.000 
is just paper and actually what he would
use<00:01:19.070> was<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.090> end<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.450> checkbook<00:01:24.010> so

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
use was the the end of a checkbook so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.560 
use was the the end of a checkbook so
when<00:01:25.160> your<00:01:25.310> cheques<00:01:25.580> are<00:01:25.730> all<00:01:25.850> done<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.120> pull

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
when your cheques are all done you pull

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.390 
when your cheques are all done you pull
that<00:01:26.750> out<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.230> then<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.470> can<00:01:27.590> fray<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.040> apart

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
that out and then you can fray it apart

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.340 
that out and then you can fray it apart
and<00:01:28.700> it's<00:01:29.450> already<00:01:29.810> stapled<00:01:30.230> together

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
and it's already stapled together

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.530 
and it's already stapled together
because<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.100> checkbook<00:01:31.520> already<00:01:32.300> had<00:01:32.450> it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
because the checkbook already had it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.720 
because the checkbook already had it
stapled<00:01:32.900> together<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:38.260> he<00:01:39.260> would<00:01:39.740> really<00:01:40.070> get

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
stapled together and he would really get

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.930 
stapled together and he would really get
his<00:01:40.940> cat<00:01:41.210> going<00:01:41.630> by<00:01:42.370> putting<00:01:43.370> it<00:01:43.490> underneath<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
his cat going by putting it underneath a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.100 
his cat going by putting it underneath a
piece<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.360> paper<00:01:44.540> or<00:01:48.760> or<00:01:49.760> in<00:01:50.210> down<00:01:50.660> into

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
piece of paper or or in down into

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.540 
piece of paper or or in down into
something<00:01:51.500> kind<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.800> like<00:01:51.950> Triggs<00:01:52.250> doing

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
something kind of like Triggs doing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.970 
something kind of like Triggs doing
right<00:01:52.700> now<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.270> really<00:01:56.450> hard<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:57.530> I've

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
right now and it is really hard as I've

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.430 
right now and it is really hard as I've
said<00:01:58.220> before<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.730> like<00:01:58.910> Necco<00:01:59.210> flies<00:01:59.630> it<00:02:00.020> is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
said before with like Necco flies it is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.250 
said before with like Necco flies it is
so<00:02:00.740> hard<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.160> film<00:02:01.490> them<00:02:01.930> when<00:02:02.930> you're<00:02:03.080> trying

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
so hard to film them when you're trying

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.440 
so hard to film them when you're trying
to<00:02:03.410> play<00:02:03.590> me

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.559 

that<00:02:07.630> was<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.200> funny<00:02:08.819> she<00:02:09.819> weighs<00:02:10.349> 24<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:13.269> this

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
that was so funny she weighs 24 and this

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.530 
that was so funny she weighs 24 and this
is<00:02:13.750> my<00:02:13.870> left<00:02:14.110> hand<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.010> I'm<00:02:15.129> playing<00:02:15.430> with<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
is my left hand and I'm playing with and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.290 
is my left hand and I'm playing with and
my<00:02:17.080> right<00:02:17.290> hand<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:19.450> preferred<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.769> use

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
my right hand is my preferred one to use

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.660 
my right hand is my preferred one to use
so<00:02:22.890> might<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.250> switch<00:02:24.459> over<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:29.670> first

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
so might have to switch over I first

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.309 
so might have to switch over I first
made<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.239> these<00:02:31.330> toys<00:02:31.660> when<00:02:31.930> Charlie<00:02:32.290> was

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
made one of these toys when Charlie was

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.890 
made one of these toys when Charlie was
a<00:02:32.440> kitten<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.099> in<00:02:33.250> trig<00:02:33.489> arrived<00:02:33.819> we<00:02:34.599> already

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
a kitten so in trig arrived we already

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.580 
a kitten so in trig arrived we already
had<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.349> toy<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.690> Bill<00:02:38.110> has

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
had the toy and I think that Bill has

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.500 
had the toy and I think that Bill has
replaced<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:40.209> portion<00:02:40.900> since<00:02:41.500> maybe<00:02:42.459> one<00:02:43.390> or

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
replaced that portion since maybe one or

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.050 
replaced that portion since maybe one or
two<00:02:43.660> times<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.590> general<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
two times but in general it's just the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.199 
two times but in general it's just the
