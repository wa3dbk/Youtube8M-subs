00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
guess I'll get all this transformation

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.190

now<00:00:46.710> first<00:00:47.399> thing<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.360> pull<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
now first thing you do is you pull this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.090 
now first thing you do is you pull this
back<00:00:49.469> section<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.140> push<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> forward<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
back section up and push it forward like

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.750 
back section up and push it forward like
that<00:00:54.170> then<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> lift<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.550> feet

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that then like if you lift it the feet

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.709 
that then like if you lift it the feet
sort<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.239> fall<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:59.329> those<00:01:00.559> sort<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
sort of just fall down but those sort of

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.310 
sort of just fall down but those sort of
pull<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> pull<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> feet
