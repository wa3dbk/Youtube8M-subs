00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.450
 hello to all boys and 8-bit 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 current news today we are going to review 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:18.730
 the worship rom on base and lg2 firmware 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.100
 hoping that the girl above lives 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.770
 don't worry too much about me 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 fucking chair and fucking table 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.080
 ok let's go see a little bit i 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.900
 detailed to them of course now 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:38.890
 new launcher I will show you how it is 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.010
 presents the newly flamboyant Rome 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:47.950
 of everything I wanted to show you this or 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.680
 that I treat 4.4.2 the kernel and that 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.710
 stop of clos then makes the ass of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.010
 kernel an excellent kernel version la 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.250
 walsh eeprom version 7 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.399
 that's why it's okay let's say I say 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.030
 immediately that with the worship or better the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.520
 workshop was developed by the same 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.229
 developer of lightning drom 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.319
 so me at the end of this review 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.840
 a little bit the ranking of those 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:22.000
 which are the three best second Rome 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.979
 me on firmware g2 ok then let's go to 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.490
 see how the roma la roma looks like 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.090
 is on a stop basis before proceeding vi 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.270
 I show the roma installer then 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.220
 what you will find when you flash e 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.620
 network this classic rom I have 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.190
 show everything a little from here 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.040
 we can choose the apps we want 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.210
 install those of lg then for 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.210
 make more or less 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.009
 light the rom nothing yes yes flash and then 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.090
 it is all over this mess 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.960
 an image of the boot animation of the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.000
 worship rom 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.799
 so I want to come back a little bit here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.950
 to show you what the apps are 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.390
 which can then be installed 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.610
 obviously not selecting them 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.599
 uninstall ok proceed with the analysis 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.239
 of the Roma 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.069
 then Rome has no details 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.500
 therefore customizations is a rome 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.380
 very light rock 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.870
 however optimized however however 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.330
 then this is the stop launcher 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.520
 so the home just flashed these 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 are the applications that I have 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.830
 selected and then what you see 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.220
 what we say is the basis on which I 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.590
 I worked echo reviewed it or gaulle 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.270
 they are classics so nothing that is not 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.980
 nothing has been added has not been removed 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.740
 nothing very very quiet this is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.490
 the settings we already have it 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.350
 given the details are the possibility of 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.780
 select the key types a 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.180
 girl's fore touch 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.910
 review will be fast because there is little 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.550
 to be seen 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.810
 of particular then the theme is alone 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.840
 that lg shock a good choice 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.600
 select the type of screen lock a 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.040
 classic screen scrolling effect 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.580
 also in this case that I do to you 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.950
 see why this also shows the 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.930
 the essentiality of the Roma where it is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.150
 developer not allowed any more 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.880
 even the developer did n't put it 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 not even the g3 keyboard but left 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.220
 the g2 keyboard 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.260
 so if you want a rom on a g2 basis 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.380
 this can be very light 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.820
 however, however, this solution however 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.000
 is the room 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.080
 let's see the room details 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.310
 obviously does not have the g2 chamber 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.940
 excuse me for the cipro 2 and the g3 i 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.940
 effects as you see missing the la 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.320
 recording in ultra hd and of course 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.200
 slow motion 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.580
 in this case the magic focus was missing 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:28.790
 children and the camera stop of these g2 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.719
 these are the slide up ups on these 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.449
 the panel 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:38.629
 the palais the volume panel I have it 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.159
 let's see nothing come back here ok 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.689
 these are the characteristics of 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.569
 roma just arrowed let's go a 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:49.310
 fluidity then comes to speak 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.830
 there is a bit smaller than the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.199
 lighting rom then the other work of 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.610
 of our legendary developer ahmed 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.439
 534 then to me of the same 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.080
 developer of lightning rom and di 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:06.199
 this is the brom e 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.310
 of abuse and in less than an hour a 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.669
 battery level 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.090
 look at his details specifically 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:18.889
 however, in my opinion it is in one 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.129
 medium and medium high but not medium 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.110
 very high not at the top in this case I have 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.969
 done 3 hours and 15 of screen 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.250
 let alone leave the 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.009
 general time because we say I rely 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.560
 much on the screen and on wifi time 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.900
 line in this case the wifi is the same 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.270
 aligns because I left the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.199
 localization via wifi in this 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.979
 case was a mix between line then 3g 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.870
 and wifi 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:50.719
 I did over four hours here 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.330
 quiet batman to save me 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:54.680
 here attention that if fatigue tv there 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.560
 takes with the stick 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.289
 what will be the duration here in this case 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.159
 of our battery 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:07.819
 here then 4 hours 18 with wifi lines 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:10.099
 activated and we say that it can be placed 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.409
 in a band we say at this point 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.330
 only then seeing this writes higher 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.120
 then my considerations what they are 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.509
 then my considerations are that the 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.160
 works from is below the lightning rome e 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.060
 all 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.410
 and to the bruce has much less 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.630
 customizations even respect 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.200
 to the bruce if I'm not mistaken if it burns 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.510
 added a lot more things than a 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.080
 this is the worship rom and therefore ne 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.670
 obviously determines the step more 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.310
 low in the sense that I think the 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.480
 ranking of the best three stock roms 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.760
 at this point build it 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.720
 quietly and in third place the 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.620
 worship rom 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.870
 in second place bruce 27 28 and al 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.970
 first place guys there are no cocks and 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.300
 the light book lightning rom says i 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.030
 decree 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:05.590
 the winner as the lightning rome is 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:10.690
 the winner learns this is ok then 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.780
 guys this is Rome 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.380

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.770
 I recommend

 I want as many people as people 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.950
