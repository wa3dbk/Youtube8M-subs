00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
your pom-pom this tunic you could also

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
your pom-pom this tunic you could also
double<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.770> yarn<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.149> wrapping

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and that way you'll still get a dense

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.219 
and that way you'll still get a dense
pom-pom<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> won't<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> wrap<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
back and forth as many times so I'll go

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.930 
center so I can see through the inner
rectangle<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.810> cut<00:02:24.080> out<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.940> now

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
rectangle that I cut out that and now

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.120

I'm<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.360> take<00:02:29.570> an<00:02:29.810> extra<00:02:30.260> piece<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.860> yarn

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
I'm going to take an extra piece of yarn

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.370 
I'm going to take an extra piece of yarn
or<00:02:31.370> another<00:02:32.240> good<00:02:32.420> thing<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.870> use<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.290> this

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
or another good thing to use for this

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.260 
or another good thing to use for this
would<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.770> dental<00:02:34.220> floss<00:02:34.460> because<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.000> doesn't

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
would be dental floss because it doesn't

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.700 
would be dental floss because it doesn't
break<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.660> wouldn't<00:02:35.930> use<00:02:35.990> sewing<00:02:36.440> thread

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
break I wouldn't use sewing thread

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.620 
break I wouldn't use sewing thread
because<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.640> need<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.910> pull<00:02:38.060> really<00:02:38.360> tight

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
because you need to pull really tight

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.150 
because you need to pull really tight
and<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.290> snap<00:02:39.560> pretty<00:02:39.830> easily

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and it can snap pretty easily

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.900 
and it can snap pretty easily
so<00:02:40.430> what<00:02:41.330> I'm<00:02:41.390> gonna<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.520> put<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.640> through
