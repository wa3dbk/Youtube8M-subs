00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 the approached wake up was first by its outward appearance 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.460
 which induces a new higher face to the French stadium 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.849
 the only vision of the eye 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.019
 it's a bit easy as next goals 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.460
 the decentralized office building 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.750
 is the perfect illustration 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.730
 the architect is envisaged as a vector of change of the conditions of 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 life and work 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.830
 the internal configuration that told them about the measuring instrument 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.950
 my 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.539
 about the size 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:11.960
 Dutch architect 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 and it's only their safety in 1950 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.690
 in the 60s he is the actor color forums 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.510
 he meets jacques maximin and she of valerie that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.120
 members of the cemetery 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.810
 two influences another boat together 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 if it were the case the more poetic sensibility 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450
 in response to the personality and scale of the constructions 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.070
 Postwar 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 their ideology 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 caudal an important place to the man and his social circle 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.750
 they are trying to explore social structures no architectural structure 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490
 this is also the precursors of a new current after the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 structuralism 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.130
 founded in 1909 amsterdam 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.980
 center bell is today 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.370
 one of the largest insurance companies in third countries 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.370
 in the early seventies the group desires are all its activities there 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.849
 then establishes a call for tenders 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.140
 the creation of new offices was entrusted to herman alston which 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.340
 the infinite number of solutions against the repetition of a module in a 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.019
 gatehouse 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.849
 last week 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.459
 his work is essentially based on the committee team from the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.289
 simple geometric elements 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.919
 we observe the different forms that can take the work of a 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.779
 community of a thousand people 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 war herbert begins to define a debate unit 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.759
 the dimensions of this unit 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.819
 derrida different activities that take place within a group of 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.559
 five to six people 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 opportunities for advancement of multiple variables 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.279
 this unit of nÃ¨pes square and repeated four times 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.059
 assembled around a traffic more fifa 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 she reformatting square meters 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.399
 she bergara passport her staff 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.499
 he rested a week 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.180
 according to him it is very important that people leave a portion of internship 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.889
 and then by appropriation 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.229
 will be transformed we have a real territory 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.879
 the idea being linked to a person or group is already beginning to emerge 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.969
 the structures coming out of the system would cost that concrete 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.799
 it's up to four ends to believe it in the form of t acer land 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.359
 second variant 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.939
 this pattern symmetrical amount equal when it is necessary to allow the circulation 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.739
 solidarize in one and the same brief piece still to recover 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.289
 defined upper coverage is expected at the third 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.919
 feeling then only the fifth 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.499
 convinced that to work 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.479
 processions but critical 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.499
 it accentuates the definition of work areas 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.499
 these cells are the only group is noticeable from the outside 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.139
 a shot behind 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.780
 I still live with different articulation system and 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.780
 interrelated 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.229
 on the one hand that it is logically constructive 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.819
 and on the other a whole series of versatile devices 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.740
 these structures other community functionality 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.559
 a variation of occupation and interaction between people 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.559
 without ever losing the notion of belonging to the total space 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.889
 successes on the plan 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.389
 I reread entries by two points 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.389
 a stretch to extend traffic often at the beginning of the decade 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.909
 to form a real desire 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
 aggregating these cells he begins to draw the shot 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.339
 their assembly falls between the groups a little frames 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.020
 then a second corpse appears 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.249
 a third 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.389
 and finally fourth 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.590
 the carcassonnais have arranged in a square all sides this trio 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.229
 of the head according to the four cardinal points 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.650
 specific functions 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.639
 it is also distributed sivom different frames 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.639
 for example the ground floor houses in his neighborhood 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.479
 reasoning and a library 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:46.990
 the first offices 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.080
 and parking levels in the southern neighborhoods 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.779
 the other three floors of the building 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.479
 it's sharing the rest of spain 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.479
 several entries are planned 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.639
 the most common focus of fact at the street level in car parks under the 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.639
 body of the building 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.629
 the new scheme possible through the structure 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.089
 the pressure of a multitude of access 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.089
 everything converges towards a main entrance 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.889
 four other secondary inputs are possible at a lower level 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.710
 and five access points is the average vertical circulation wage
