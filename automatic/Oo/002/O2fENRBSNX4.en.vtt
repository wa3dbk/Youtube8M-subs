plastic<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:01.360> plastic<00:05:01.990> was<00:05:02.200> left<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:03.030> during

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
plastic this plastic was left in during

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.360 
plastic this plastic was left in during
the<00:05:04.120> manufacturing<00:05:04.750> process<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.530> it's

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
the manufacturing process so it's

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.970 
the manufacturing process so it's
actually<00:05:06.550> stitched<00:05:07.330> into<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:08.200> part<00:05:08.590> of

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.610 

where<00:05:11.980> your<00:05:12.220> knee<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.900> actually<00:05:14.200> will

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
make noise and kind of crunch if you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.220

actually<00:05:17.980> go<00:05:18.400> inside<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:19.510> turn<00:05:19.900> this<00:05:20.020> inside

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
actually go inside and turn this inside

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.450 
actually go inside and turn this inside
out<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:22.090> can<00:05:22.240> hear<00:05:22.390> going<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.720> there<00:05:23.460> we've

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
out you can hear going in there we've

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.300 
out you can hear going in there we've
got<00:05:24.669> this<00:05:24.820> crunching<00:05:25.419> sound<00:05:26.100> because<00:05:27.100> it's

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
got this crunching sound because it's

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.630 
got this crunching sound because it's
actually<00:05:27.490> plastic<00:05:30.300> still<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.600> here<00:05:32.490> as<00:05:33.490> you

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
actually plastic still in here as you

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.260 
actually plastic still in here as you
can<00:05:33.760> see<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:35.950> is<00:05:36.100> just<00:05:36.280> stitched<00:05:36.760> in

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.300 

underneath<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.419> knees<00:05:40.830> but<00:05:41.830> it's<00:05:41.980> just<00:05:42.160> on

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
underneath the knees but it's just on

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.330 
underneath the knees but it's just on
that<00:05:42.490> one<00:05:42.669> side

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
that one side

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.370 
that one side
so<00:05:44.940> that's<00:05:45.630> something<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:46.050> take<00:05:46.200> into

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
so that's something to take into

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.190 
so that's something to take into
consideration<00:05:46.620> if<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:47.610> are<00:05:47.760> gonna<00:05:48.200> are

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.760 
speak tanning house and they said that
this<00:06:22.350> is<00:06:22.560> how<00:06:23.750> all<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:25.080> jeans<00:06:25.290> already<00:06:25.620> say

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
that they're all the same quality so

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.550 
that they're all the same quality so
take<00:06:29.880> that<00:06:30.030> into<00:06:30.210> consideration<00:06:30.360> if<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:31.410> are

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
going to order these because chances are

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.730 
going to order these because chances are
you're<00:06:34.380> gonna<00:06:34.500> get<00:06:34.770> some<00:06:35.670> plastic<00:06:35.910> on<00:06:36.360> here

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
you're gonna get some plastic on here

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.710 
you're gonna get some plastic on here
which<00:06:37.740> will<00:06:38.400> see<00:06:38.640> how<00:06:38.820> hard<00:06:39.030> it<00:06:39.180> is<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.360> get<00:06:39.540> off

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
which will see how hard it is to get off

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.070 
which will see how hard it is to get off
but<00:06:40.550> take<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.580> second<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.210> LIKE<00:06:42.390> comment<00:06:42.870> and
