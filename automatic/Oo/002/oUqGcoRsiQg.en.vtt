about<00:00:09.630> these<00:00:09.929> limit<00:00:10.380> screws<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.429> they

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
about these limit screws is that they

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.490 
about these limit screws is that they
actually<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:12.240> what<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> name<00:00:12.750> implies<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
actually do what the name implies that

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.460 
actually do what the name implies that
they<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.740> they<00:00:14.670> determine<00:00:15.269> how<00:00:15.480> far<00:00:15.809> sideways

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470

it in you'll notice that that pulley
moves<00:00:34.860> inboard<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.690> when<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> let<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
moves inboard and when we let it out of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
moves inboard and when we let it out of
course<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> moves<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.520> other<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:41.690> okay<00:00:42.690> let's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
course it moves the other way okay let's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.229 
course it moves the other way okay let's
do<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> real<00:00:43.350> live<00:00:43.559> adjustment<00:00:44.190> notice<00:00:45.090> how

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
do a real live adjustment notice how

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
do a real live adjustment notice how
this<00:00:45.390> bike<00:00:45.629> shifts<00:00:46.170> we've<00:00:46.710> set<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
this bike shifts we've set it up so it's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
this bike shifts we've set it up so it's
a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.670> slow<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> shift<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.840> smaller<00:00:49.260> cog

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a little slow to shift into smaller cog

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.819 
a little slow to shift into smaller cog
which<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> high<00:00:50.489> gear<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> leave

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
which is the high gear we want to leave

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
which is the high gear we want to leave
you<00:00:52.980> eight<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.550> adjusting<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.239> high

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you eight that by adjusting the high

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.439 
you eight that by adjusting the high
gear<00:00:54.750> limit<00:00:55.260> screw<00:00:55.610> will<00:00:56.610> let<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> screw<00:00:57.270> out

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
gear limit screw will let this screw out

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
gear limit screw will let this screw out
a<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.559> allow<00:00:58.829> their

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a little bit and it will allow their

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.380 
a little bit and it will allow their
derailleur<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> move<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.090> farther

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
derailleur to move a little farther

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
derailleur to move a little farther
outboard<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> carry<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> chain<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
outboard and carry the chain with it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.590 
outboard and carry the chain with it
and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.149> shift<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.899> crisply

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
and it will shift a little more crisply

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.179 
and it will shift a little more crisply
now<00:01:06.600> we've<00:01:06.810> set<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> derailleur<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
now we've set up the derailleur so that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
now we've set up the derailleur so that
it<00:01:08.280> won't<00:01:08.369> shift<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> low<00:01:09.240> gear<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.689> big

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it won't shift into the low gear or big

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
it won't shift into the low gear or big
cog<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.490> did<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> high<00:01:12.090> gears

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
cog just like we did with the high gears

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
cog just like we did with the high gears
we'll<00:01:12.869> let<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> low<00:01:13.350> gear<00:01:13.619> screw<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
we'll let the low gear screw out a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
we'll let the low gear screw out a
little<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.090> derailleur<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.659> move

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
little and the derailleur will move

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.960 
little and the derailleur will move
farther<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.470> board<00:01:16.770> carrying<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> chain<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
farther in board carrying the chain with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.100 
farther in board carrying the chain with
it<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.270> onto<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> big<00:01:18.930> cog<00:01:20.659> now<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.960> we've

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it and onto the big cog now here we've

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
it and onto the big cog now here we've
set<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> scenario<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> derailleur

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
set up a scenario where the derailleur

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
set up a scenario where the derailleur
moves<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.450> far<00:01:24.689> inboard<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.740> problem<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
moves too far inboard the problem here

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
moves too far inboard the problem here
is<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> derailleur<00:01:27.540> moves<00:01:27.570> too<00:01:28.020> far

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is that if the derailleur moves too far

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
is that if the derailleur moves too far
in<00:01:28.530> board<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.340> overshoot<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> cog<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
in board it will overshoot the cog and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
in board it will overshoot the cog and
throw<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> chain<00:01:31.320> into<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> spokes<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.549> we'll

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
throw the chain into the spokes so we'll

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
throw the chain into the spokes so we'll
prevent<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> problem<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:33.930> turning<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> low

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
prevent that problem by turning the low

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.370 
prevent that problem by turning the low
gear<00:01:34.680> screw<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.329> stop<00:01:36.630> or<00:01:36.900> limit

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gear screw in this will stop or limit

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
gear screw in this will stop or limit
the<00:01:37.710> inboard<00:01:38.130> travel<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> derailleur<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the inboard travel of the derailleur and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.910 
the inboard travel of the derailleur and
prevent<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:39.960> throwing<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> chain<00:01:40.740> off

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
prevent it from throwing the chain off

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
prevent it from throwing the chain off
you'll<00:01:41.549> notice<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> screw<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you'll notice that when the screw is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.450 
you'll notice that when the screw is
properly<00:01:43.020> set<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.680> top<00:01:43.920> pulley<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
properly set the top pulley on the
derailleur<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.540> directly<00:01:45.930> below<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
derailleur will be directly below the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
derailleur will be directly below the
center<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> big<00:01:47.009> cog<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
center of the big cog that's how you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.370 
center of the big cog that's how you
know<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.509> you've<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.930> adjustment

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
know when you've got the adjustment

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.780 
know when you've got the adjustment
right<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.770> let's<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> part<00:01:53.579> two<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
right okay so let's go to part two of

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
right okay so let's go to part two of
our<00:01:54.000> discussion<00:01:54.060> which<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
our discussion which has to do with the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.350 
our discussion which has to do with the
barrel<00:01:55.860> adjuster<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.549> barrel<00:01:57.270> adjuster

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
barrel adjuster the barrel adjuster

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
barrel adjuster the barrel adjuster
affects<00:01:58.110> any<00:01:58.409> shifting<00:01:58.890> problems<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.579> are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
affects any shifting problems that are

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
affects any shifting problems that are
going<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> middle<00:02:00.659> range<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
going on in the middle range of the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
going on in the middle range of the
cassette<00:02:01.850> here's<00:02:02.850> how<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.119> supposed<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
cassette here's how it's supposed to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
cassette here's how it's supposed to
look<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.020> shifting<00:02:04.380> right

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
look when it's shifting right

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.890 
look when it's shifting right
you<00:02:05.550> run<00:02:05.790> through<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.000> gears<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.660> if<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
you run through the gears and see if it

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.320 
you run through the gears and see if it
shifts<00:02:07.350> crisply<00:02:07.830> going<00:02:08.430> down<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.850> range<00:02:09.090> as

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
shifts crisply going down the range as

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.410 
shifts crisply going down the range as
well<00:02:09.510> as<00:02:09.570> up<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.700> you'll<00:02:11.700> notice<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.180> have

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
well as up and you'll notice if you have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.000 
well as up and you'll notice if you have
problems<00:02:12.930> because<00:02:13.350> either<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:13.800> hesitate

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
problems because either it will hesitate

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.770 
problems because either it will hesitate
to<00:02:14.430> shift<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.880> it'll<00:02:15.030> shift<00:02:15.210> more<00:02:15.480> than<00:02:15.630> one

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
to shift or it'll shift more than one

hesitant as it goes from the smallest to
the<00:02:23.850> next<00:02:24.150> biggest<00:02:24.360> cog<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:25.530> an

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the next biggest cog that's an

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.020 
the next biggest cog that's an
indication<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.280> there's<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.730> quite<00:02:26.970> enough

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
indication that there's not quite enough

indication that there's not quite enough
tension<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.870> cable<00:02:28.580> we'll<00:02:29.580> check<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
tension on that cable we'll check it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.250 
tension on that cable we'll check it
through<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> whole<00:02:30.330> range<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.020> how<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
through the whole range and see how it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
through the whole range and see how it
behaves<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.510> need<00:02:33.630> an

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
behaves but we can see we need an

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.600 
behaves but we can see we need an
adjustment<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> we'll<00:02:35.070> make<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.490> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
adjustment and we'll make it on this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.880 
adjustment and we'll make it on this
barrel<00:02:35.970> adjuster<00:02:36.420> we'll<00:02:36.990> add<00:02:37.200> tension<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
barrel adjuster we'll add tension to the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.290 
barrel adjuster we'll add tension to the
cable<00:02:38.220> by<00:02:38.340> turning<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> barrel<00:02:39.180> adjuster

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
cable by turning the barrel adjuster

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.960 
cable by turning the barrel adjuster
counterclockwise<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.800> then<00:02:41.670> we'll<00:02:41.790> check

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
counterclockwise and then we'll check

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.240 
counterclockwise and then we'll check
the<00:02:42.120> shifting<00:02:42.510> again<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.080> notice<00:02:44.070> we'll

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the shifting again and notice we'll

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.730 
the shifting again and notice we'll
check<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.210> low<00:02:45.360> gear<00:02:45.660> range<00:02:45.990> as<00:02:46.290> well

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
check it on the low gear range as well

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.430 
check it on the low gear range as well
as<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.980> high<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.020> when<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
as the high one and when we have the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
as the high one and when we have the
adjustment<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> will<00:02:50.310> shift<00:02:50.550> crisply

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
adjustment right it will shift crisply

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
adjustment right it will shift crisply
through<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> range<00:02:51.720> both<00:02:52.710> going<00:02:53.040> up<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
through the range both going up and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.420 
through the range both going up and
going<00:02:54.000> down<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:57.110> here's<00:02:58.110> our<00:02:58.230> final<00:02:58.530> check<00:02:58.890> we

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
going down and here's our final check we

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.040 
going down and here's our final check we
want<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.820> sure<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.209> these<00:03:00.360> pulley<00:03:00.720> wheels

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
want to be sure that these pulley wheels

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.110
