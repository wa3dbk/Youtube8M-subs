00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
stance stanced shifting there's a lot of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.469 
stance stanced shifting there's a lot of
other<00:01:14.610> things<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.090> doing<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.420> now

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
other things that we're doing right now

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
other things that we're doing right now
that<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.720> super<00:01:16.170> cool<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.650> we're<00:01:17.189> gonna<00:01:17.280> have

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that are super cool but we're gonna have

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
that are super cool but we're gonna have
to<00:01:17.430> save<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.000> another<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to save that for another time the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300 
to save that for another time the
gameplay<00:01:19.290> keeps<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.890> getting<00:01:19.979> stronger

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gameplay keeps on getting stronger

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.770 
gameplay keeps on getting stronger
because<00:01:20.520> our<00:01:20.909> tools<00:01:21.150> keep<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.570> getting

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
because our tools keep on getting

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
because our tools keep on getting
stronger<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:23.340> importantly<00:01:23.880> our

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stronger and more importantly our

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
stronger and more importantly our
experience<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.259> wealth<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> knowledge<00:01:26.189> and

experience and wealth of knowledge and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
experience and wealth of knowledge and
just<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> tools<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> how

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just like how to use the tools and how

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
just like how to use the tools and how
to<00:01:28.890> leverage<00:01:29.460> our<00:01:29.670> creativity<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to leverage our creativity into that is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.300 
to leverage our creativity into that is
getting<00:01:31.079> better<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
getting better as well well the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
getting better as well well the
interesting<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.780> sex<00:01:33.990> minigame

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
interesting thing about the sex minigame

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.560

is<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> those<00:01:36.210> things<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is I do it is one of those things that's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
is I do it is one of those things that's
like<00:01:36.869> you're<00:01:37.049> damned<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.650> any<00:01:37.829> damned
