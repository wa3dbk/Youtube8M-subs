00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.839
 [music] 

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.839
 [applause] 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.600

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.129
 March let's start with all women's brushes 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.350
 we have all the packages today 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.720
 ordered using free 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.910
 the intermediary of aliexpress Ukraine what is it 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.029
 so look under the video again so again 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.509
 we are with our over blunt knife it's just 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.860
 my credo life is cut by reference 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.430
 at the top of the simulator now get 10 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.520
 tassels 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.470
 and look at them seemingly packed and 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.550
 not bad it inside immediately immediately less 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.790
 so wants scotch scotch and cut i don't 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 away want so well here apparently 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.230
 some purse is power in this 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.860
 kind 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.970
 [music] 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.970
 I don't like it already 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:13.940
 only unfold so much so much 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.670
 so proper ingredient to someone about 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.490
 what to say so here apparently not 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.480
 just a brush that will help kill 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.390
 only brushes 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.090
 And this reading something in addition that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.190
 of course, reference minutes, of course, everything goes 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.890
 under the video but I'm not even sure if 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.790
 always because there seems to be tassels yes 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 and this is that well, probably just give immediately 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.420
 Found all the reference brushes 10 dollars 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.000
 there yes and the shadows are these up oh good palette 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 good in terms of not having anything 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.090
 scattered all went well would 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.490
 close so much to nothing 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 spoil everything faster fuck back to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.590
 again do not spoil anything of course 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.520
 all this will be ours so let's say 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.320
 customer at our free intermediary 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.540
 all-all sensation to poison 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.110
 the ball miracle will glue up not scary and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.080
 such tradimo back ago 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.110
 because I am all very machine 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.350
 Today, even immediately served with you all 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.600
 now owner policy by the copyright holder 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.600
 so on a tassel 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.090
 so somehow not very pleasant 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.330
 material 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.800
 there are practically no smells 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.440
 the whole set opens 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.989
 tassels see mind inhaling 6 very 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.830
 very fluffy such a huge tassel 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.090
 pancake 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.890
 I want to clean it right away 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.810
 but I won't be dumb he won't be weird 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.239
 Of course, what a little case and very pink 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.220
 cat glamorous on a tassel like on 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.890
 the view is definitely not bad but better 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.590
 hard to say but do not see what was climbing 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.720
 something or the smell there seems to be unpleasant 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:09.410
 not bad but $ 8 it seems wrong 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:13.220
 and a lot so we do not wrap up days like this 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.769
 there must be a boy so what does it mean 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.840
 boy with these handbags and the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.870
 like, okay, this is not the point 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.420
 necessarily so the next package wrapped 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.000
 here we have 20 20 20 to march 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.769
 now we will try oh again this 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.610
 rigid foam like I always 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.620
 it is not clear where the package is hiding here 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.989
 You have to pick one like this and then 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.290
 these things are just everywhere you see 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.280
 Now package wrapped understandable where and we can 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.010
 already here 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.060
 cut off at least here here 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 so here go down 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:58.700
 he is still all alone 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:04.469
 more grunicheva 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:08.299
 just look like this 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:11.810
 srach of course this packaging is good but 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:15.389
 to get something out of it you need to be 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.199
 craftsman but of course nothing 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:24.960
 choking on guys is just a tin 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:27.690
 the meaty room will be in these things so 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.460
 but they hike from damn let's probably I 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.099
 pause and return to you will remove 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.990
 this crap just makes me unpleasant 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.930
 actually in my room was winter I 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.849
 do n't even know different faces lights colors i 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.520
 I think that here is some well yes, you see 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.070
 different designation well, let's probably 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.210
 open a couple because well, as if all 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.710
 I 'll open up just crazy damn 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.710
 so much lipstick 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.840
 at $ 20 they cost now I 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.909
 I’ll definitely say for sure 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.289
 Irochki doubted everything under the video 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.289
 pretty 20 bucks 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:12.360
 what is written and actually so 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.330
 lipstick but I think that under the video reference 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.159
 there all colors are indicated specifically 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.710
 Palette, in principle, there I think everything will be 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.770
 everything is clear here randomly open hour 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.810
 two more things I want this I want this 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.699
 this fritz we will now open the drone 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.360
 quite a while all these things and look at 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.360
 shaking Vasya 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.750
 it is pure red well the camera of course 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.120
 sends where I don’t want anymore 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.310
 open, in principle, everything is clear 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.980
 everything seems to be normal everything seems to be 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.010
 everything seems to be working normal 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.130
 qualities so these are all parcels hanging 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.740
 the customer and you were danil bukreev 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.170
 All references to the goods under the video are not 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.220
 say goodbye and say goodbye to new 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.220
 video bye
