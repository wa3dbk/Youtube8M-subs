00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:15.020
 so I will not forget about it here 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:26.460
 open names that I opened my name here 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:30.689
 valve control 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.740
 The staff was spot on keeps talking about the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.399
 total 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.680
 because that's where I'll have it here was a 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.579
 such that it is a cause but not shot 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.500
 The macaca has arrived today. 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.199
 roman of palm 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:00.620
 This is good, did not take it back here. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 around 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:12.570
 here does not have it here shows that she 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:21.470
 lives on the same street one valve plate is 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:29.460
 here in ge as the command of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:32.189
 command here next to here only cap is the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.909
 from the committee to the time of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.100
 This admission is the most 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.030
 This is the command here. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.909
 It is hair removal key is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.400
 powerful tool to remove paulo 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.020
 this one is the thin 16 - valve 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.939
 Boot down something else hot now 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.240
 so here I see a lot of people more 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.570
 here and this command is not valid is not 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.470
 huh 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:13.660
 time there is water which opposes 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:15.970
 difference between the 1 and an ivory tree 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.980
 would never be similar to that of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.390
 low 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.660
 the difference between the tree because it is 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 because to open all that it transmits 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 By moving and that's all that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.989
 which is something different 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.569
 with which it does not transmit 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:46.200
 motion and force and movement is then a 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.200
 axis to see with a kiss 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.890
 this is the end in the mud 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.160
 I will protect an ex-top to a tire of a 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.959
 this is a mistake 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.390
 ok, ok, it 's running around it 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.880
 here is an ax to pick up a trade for 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.019
 my wheel axle tip an environment 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.790
 because the tip is so that the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.790
 wheel turns on it 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:28.250
 the difference of the father is because if this 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.300
 fashion sewer said hit a 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.880
 great river center 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.610
 He's staying on my son's team in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.600
 nine games and we will enforce a goal in the eye 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.600
 with the motoboy sewer escaped 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.920
 is the youngest older as I was 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.150
 well here are 16 of digital made michael 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:58.440
 only you alone are confusing because 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:01.380
 case of jetta nozzles 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.650
 little I have a gay kit the world tour 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.970
 of defense and sent of nozzle of the stock 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.730
 They name the people here but not just not 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.139
 that it is redeeming redeeming time the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.389
 valve control is because it has no 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.389
 I got what I wanted and want well.
