00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
PlayStation Vita gameplay which I'll be

learn from each of these you know little
one-second<00:00:26.279> segments<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.090> be

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
one-second segments so gonna be

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
analyzing it in super super slow speed

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it pretty creative build by the way but

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
it pretty creative build by the way but
the<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.620> interests<00:00:49.950> me<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the one thing that interests me here is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
the one thing that interests me here is
the<00:00:50.789> fact<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.750> PlayStation<00:00:51.989> Vita<00:00:52.350> like

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the fact that the PlayStation Vita like

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
the fact that the PlayStation Vita like
the<00:00:52.890> top<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> iron<00:00:53.489> blocks<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the top put the iron blocks and the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700 
the top put the iron blocks and the
jungle<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.719> both<00:00:54.930> seem<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.260> at<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> same

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
jungle they both seem to be at the same

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
jungle they both seem to be at the same
height<00:00:55.739> which<00:00:56.430> kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> implies<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
height which kind of implies that the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
height which kind of implies that the
PlayStation<00:00:57.840> Vita<00:00:58.170> world<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> limited<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.280> 120

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
PlayStation Vita world is limited at 120

PlayStation Vita world is limited at 120
X<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.930> looks<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> round<00:01:01.590> y

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
X if you look that looks like a round y

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
X if you look that looks like a round y
equals<00:01:02.219> 128<00:01:02.789> meaning<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> might<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
equals 128 meaning it might not have the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
equals 128 meaning it might not have the
doubled<00:01:04.530> white<00:01:04.680> well<00:01:05.010> tight<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.700> for

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
doubled white well tight with that's for

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
doubled white well tight with that's for
space<00:01:06.119> limitations<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.780> technical

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
space limitations or technical

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
space limitations or technical
limitations<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.770> guess<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> space<00:01:08.220> limitation

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
limitations I guess a space limitation

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399 
limitations I guess a space limitation
is<00:01:08.729> technical<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> remains<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.200> seen

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
is technical as it remains to be seen

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
is technical as it remains to be seen
but<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.040> interesting<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.960> next<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
but it's kind of interesting up next we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
but it's kind of interesting up next we
see<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:13.439> bigs<00:01:13.650> breeding<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.490> using<00:01:14.790> carrots

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
see two bigs breeding here using carrots

see two bigs breeding here using carrots
which<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.770> opinion<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> shows<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
which in my opinion it shows that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.249 
which in my opinion it shows that
they're<00:01:17.939> showing<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.840> features

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they're showing that like all features

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
they're showing that like all features
will<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.280> gonna<00:01:20.369> try<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
will be on there they're gonna try and

cut down some of the technical features
a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> current<00:01:23.460> console

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
a little bit from the current console

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
a little bit from the current console
versions<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:24.540> keeping<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
versions but they're keeping it all in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
versions but they're keeping it all in
there<00:01:25.259> okay<00:01:25.590> next<00:01:25.860> burn<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.189> NPC<00:01:26.610> village<00:01:26.640> full

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
there okay next burn an NPC village full

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.760 
there okay next burn an NPC village full
of<00:01:27.509> empty<00:01:27.780> villages<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.259> been<00:01:28.409> modified

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of empty villages that's been modified

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
of empty villages that's been modified
quite<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> technical<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
quite a bit but the technical thing that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
quite a bit but the technical thing that
I<00:01:30.900> notice<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> look<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I notice here is if you look in the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
I notice here is if you look in the
distance<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.060> render<00:01:33.299> distance<00:01:33.450> looks<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
distance the render distance looks like

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
distance the render distance looks like
it's<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.500> three<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.070> four<00:01:35.310> chunks<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.759> front

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's about three or four chunks in front

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.910 
it's about three or four chunks in front
of<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.570> isn't<00:01:36.750> too<00:01:36.960> bad<00:01:37.110> consider<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
of you which isn't too bad consider you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.289 
of you which isn't too bad consider you
know<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> small<00:01:38.640> screen<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> don't

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know it's on a small screen so you don't

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
know it's on a small screen so you don't
need<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> definitely

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
need it as much but it is definitely

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.889 
need it as much but it is definitely
something<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.820> notice<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
something to notice so here is the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.960 
something to notice so here is the
nether

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
nether

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.160 
nether
which<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.210> looking<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> get

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
which I was looking at see if we can get

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
which I was looking at see if we can get
some<00:01:46.290> fourth<00:01:46.500> sized<00:01:46.799> reference<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> looks

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
some fourth sized reference and it looks

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
some fourth sized reference and it looks
like<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.600> gonna<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> same<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.860> know

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like it's gonna be the same you know

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
like it's gonna be the same you know
cut-down<00:01:50.369> version<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:50.939> ever<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
cut-down version than ever from the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
cut-down version than ever from the
console<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.380> one<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:52.710> three<00:01:52.890> blocks

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
console so it's one two three blocks

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
console so it's one two three blocks
rather<00:01:53.820> than<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.240> being<00:01:54.479> cut<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:54.659> even

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
rather than you know being cut down even

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
rather than you know being cut down even
more<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.320> instead<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.159> being<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.549> 400

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
more so instead of you know being a 400

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.760 
more so instead of you know being a 400
by<00:01:57.149> 400<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.689> might<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.899> slightly<00:01:58.110> smaller<00:01:58.380> it'd

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
by 400 it might be slightly smaller it'd

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
by 400 it might be slightly smaller it'd
be<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> hundred<00:01:59.310> by<00:01:59.579> hundred<00:01:59.610> just<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> tiny

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
be like a hundred by hundred just a tiny

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.480 
be like a hundred by hundred just a tiny
low<00:02:00.600> never<00:02:00.899> fortunately<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.130> full

which is good it's not gonna be next-gen

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
which is good it's not gonna be next-gen
console<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.500> gonna<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.009> regular

never so this piece feet have really is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.920 
never so this piece feet have really is
shaping<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.910> console<00:02:12.510> versions

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
shaping up to be the console versions

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.400 
shaping up to be the console versions
but<00:02:13.140> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.160 
but on
go<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> small<00:02:14.730> small<00:02:15.240> difference<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
go with the small small difference that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.900 
go with the small small difference that
instead<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.400> getting<00:02:17.580> along<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
instead of you know getting along the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
instead of you know getting along the
render<00:02:18.180> distance<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.900> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.350> get

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
render distance you kind of have to get

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
render distance you kind of have to get
that<00:02:19.530> cut<00:02:19.740> down<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.190> some<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> what<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
that cut down and some of the what the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
that cut down and some of the what the
world<00:02:21.720> size<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> world<00:02:22.470> height<00:02:22.710> are

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
world size and the world height are

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.620 
world size and the world height are
being<00:02:23.310> cut<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:23.880> they're<00:02:24.030> getting<00:02:24.270> all<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
being cut but they're getting all the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.820 
being cut but they're getting all the
features<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:25.080> there<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.470> gonna<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
features in there and it's gonna get the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.500 
features in there and it's gonna get the
objects<00:02:26.100> at<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> same<00:02:26.520> time<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> console

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
objects at the same time as the console

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.630 
objects at the same time as the console
so<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.680> kind<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.070> exciting<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
