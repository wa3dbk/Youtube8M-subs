Hi and welcome to The Vegan Corner.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.804
This recipe was a tough one to develop.

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:08.216
I faced many challenges
creating this recipe.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:12.080
Partly as I only recently tasted
ranch dressing for the first time,

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.022
but also as if you remove the eggs,
buttermilk and oil from this recipe,

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:19.182
you are left with a bunch of
onion-smelling chopped herbs,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.653
and that is definitely not a recipe
I'm looking forward to posting.

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:24.794
If you want to know more
about this preparation,

00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:29.000
please keep watching, knowing full well that
the ingredient list in the description box.

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:31.628
Once again, today we have
one of "those" recipes.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.000
That's right, you throw
all the ingredients in,

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:36.684
blend, and hope that your
friends at The Vegan Corner

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.000
gave you a good recipe.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.206
First of all though,
we must chop the parsley.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:43.754
For the parsley we find it is best
to chop it as finely as you can.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.330
If you don't fancy parsley,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.720
then other herbs such as chives
or dill also work perfectly.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.720
Place the tofu in a food processor

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.239
and blitz to obtain a
creamy and smooth paste.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.028
You can also use a blender
at the lowest speed.

00:00:57.382 --> 00:01:00.000
Next add the milk,
the vinegar, the lemon juice

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.000
and blend again to incorporate them.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:05.441
Now add the mustard,
the garlic and onion granules

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:07.062
and the ground black pepper.

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:09.221
Blitz again to incorporate
the ingredients.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.000
The last ingredients to
add before blitzing again

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.000
are the salt (if desired)
and the chopped parsley.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:17.568
Pay attention not to blend
too much at this point,

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:20.163
as you simply want to mix in
the parsley and the salt in.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.234
If you do blend too much,
the parsley will disintegrate

00:01:23.244 --> 00:01:25.594
and you will obtain a
green ranch dressing,

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:28.661
which we could call a Grinch
dressing, or Granch dressing,

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.535
or maybe we should simply avoid
blending the parsley too much

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.000
so that I don't have to rack
my brains to make jokes

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.589
that are not really funny at all.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.000
Just stick to the
instructions, OK? Cheers.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.196
And there you have it:

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.237
a fully vegan, truly delectable,

00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:44.243
basically fat-free ranch
dressing to die for.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.645
I personally enjoy pouring
this stuff everywhere,

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.000
including (but not limited to) potatoes,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.468
rice, salad and if I'm
feeling clumsy... cloths!

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:53.980
I hope you enjoyed today's video

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.324
and if you give this recipe a go,
please let us know if you enjoyed it.

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:59.465
Thanks for watching
