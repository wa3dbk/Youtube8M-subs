00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.859
 Another one of the double-headed ones today 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.420
 I show you with the adobe 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 premiere pro and adobe cs 6 ne dvd or 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 You can create blu-ray and that too 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 Brand it directly from a premiere 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.289
 I could show you the whole thing 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.289
 right after the intro 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.880
 so and now I'm already the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.099
 I have a premiere pro here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.760
 the same as the title so how 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.129
 at the title tutorials to show on 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.129
 paper so this is the with the title 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.629
 So it offers the whole from below hochvolt 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.220
 you have to export this first 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.449
 need the only time where you between 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.910
 must edges or something 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.519
 for that i will control this here and now 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.290
 control emmaus then I take as 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.089
 format h 264 blu ray and the default 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.610
 I will be here what I need 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.700
 and it is here of my knowledge grad 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.320
 material metal so the 720p hd with 50 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.570
 That's why I'm going to take pictures per second 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 Now I just save all that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 fast here on the desktop as blu-ray 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.950
 point m4v override that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.479
 then leave that easy quickly 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.920
 export directly from the program 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.920
 out with export 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 then it is 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.450
 and I'll go straight to encore 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 I am now talking about a new project 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.690
 So I take the standard 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.390
 location and I call now simply 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.970
 flow right there I can still as 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.890
 earring mode between the blu ray and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.290
 dvd if i would always gloria 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.619
 recommend then you will edit that 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.300
 whole in 10 29 to 10 80 p but one has 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.270
 then later not the problem that 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.410
 sometimes it is edited in dvd so has 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.910
 from the size and then another 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.440
 Blu-ray wants and when I am bleeding 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.149
 I can always make a dvd selection 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.970
 but if i dvd out how can i mean 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.520
 Blu-ray make TV standard I'll take 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.460
 I would always take out, except one 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.630
 make something for america for america 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.959
 or japan 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.489
 then you need ntsc and the rest 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.160
 fits then I click here ok then 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.880
 I can make it here then 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:23.020
 directly from the desktop the file load that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.020
 is the wrong that is the one here 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.650
 I've got this one file the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.080
 You can also look up there then 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.810
 I just have to do it here 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.120
 right click on it and then 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.260
 just new and then cut window 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.730
 then I have this already 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.220
 So I'll see those too directly 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.780
 researcher as well as who else in the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.150
 I can premiere pro then too 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.890
 the skin is still the language I speak 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.989
 I leave the audio track decency 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.030
 now in German there's no 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.010
 audio but you can then adjust 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.170
 that is what you later on 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.200
 dvd recorder or something can set 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 in the menu or blu ray player in the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.070
 menus then the language you can 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.410
 then it will be there when I put on de 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.760
 the track used then I have that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.860
 already 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.890
 imported and everything then I speak 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.239
 Now if I can, that's why I can 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.379
 which also create already get for 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.209
 I'm up there in the still further 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.970
 drilling project is also able to manufacture if that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.590
 I do not have this window 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.650
 create so let display or 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.810
 Just press f2 then I'll take it first 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.489
 format blu-ray and then I can here 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.599
 just have a blu-ray image done 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.560
 or directly on a blu-ray 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.739
 let write 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.470
 I take an image then I take 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.400
 the source of the current project 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.230
 destination folder it is easy to do 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.430
 I'll search that fast 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:55.129
 Here I can just so daniel here 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 still nice girl yes then exactly can 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:04.750
 I change the name here so that 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.750
 Now I call it somehow point 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.940
 Jesus then I click save 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.530
 Blu-ray size is there one more 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.930
 but it depends on where massa 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.349
 wants to burn it and then you have that 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.599
 even then I can only open 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.870
 then project audits will be 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.910
 always doubt two reminders are displayed 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.979
 but that does next because currently is 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.260
 the easy way to put them right in 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.900
 dvd player inserts or blu-ray player 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.919
 is lodges and played it then then 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.780
 I already know it for that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.160
 create 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.710
 I must then ignore the error 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.110
 but otherwise it fits 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 and if I am so and if so 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.890
 then later some remote windows 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.180
 or something else you can do that 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.010
 I'll do that too 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.350
 in the future a few tutorials on something like that 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.580
 upload my channel but first 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.020
 That's it and that's the way you can do it 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.280
 iso file you can then also quite 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.930
 just double-click 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.120
 windows or something on an infinite number 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.520
 blu rays or dvd or blu rays in the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.310
 case stop and then the blue 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.200
 it all burned so fast and it was 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.640
 already with the tutorial and if it is you 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.590
 I would have liked about one 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.580
