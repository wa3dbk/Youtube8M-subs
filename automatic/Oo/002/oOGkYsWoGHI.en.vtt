 You already because the night is kind of difficult. 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:25.920
 See here in the dragon chest on 17 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:30.659
 but the appearance that if I'm not mistaken I 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 I do not know what is more mature than have the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 game you'll have to pay the hotel and there 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.070
 It's very cool, man, let me draw it. 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.009
 these weapons to fight to have a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.890
 better visualization of you for you 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.320
 for she looks old and she is strong 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 look look it he details it she 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.490
 texture is very well made 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 one thing I did not like is the one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 thing actually I did not like it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 that since I'm a little crazy is was the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 Reason why I did not use them were even me 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.780
 I did not use Rodrigue because of this. 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.950
 Look, he's playing and he's got this deal. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
 here on the screen 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.290
 look at this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.840
 even without playing right to it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.239
 business here because she 's mine 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.750
 costumed that in front has intense 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:30.450
 do not know is whether this disease in front of the Sa 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.150
 rubella in the strange business there and only 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 I did not like it or said I had 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.650
 one thing I did not like was the one 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:45.569
 But I found it very cool. 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:50.269
 well done same face and use it is very 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.269
 cool, you can notice teeth details 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.400
 they are orange, of course, it's very cool and the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.049
 better also that you do not need 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.480
 increase your level of smith 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.909
 You need to do nothing, you come and pick it up. 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.340
 the armature showing here the status of 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:11.969
 best you 50 to arm 20 in art 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.719
 in the boot 20 here in the glove and 23 in the 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.269
 really it's not good it's just you 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.019
 find here remembering that just do not 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.620
 mistake 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:31.799
 She has these effects with my love. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:35.909
 in the air then it will get very strong and 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.540
 She's really cool, and she's the type you buy. 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.560
 I think it's best to 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.569
 maybe it's not better that I already showed 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.959
 here but she's cool 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:51.209
 then crowd was short but that's it for 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:55.829
 today 11 detonated or something like that 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.590
 law but on the one hand detonated even 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:03.060
 channel already in the first episode you know 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:07.699
 I've already finished or not. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.989
 episode and good this is it 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:14.150
 comments suggesting molds or 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.150
 suggesting anything useful 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.510
 I liked the new one. 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.790
 in the scale channel and shows that it has 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.650
 all the ways I've shown you 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.000
 all the death videos who several 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.540
 cool ways to this you still have not seen 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.370
 but you can take a look and probably 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.560
 some of them will interest you that 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.070
 like scorn these meat deaths 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.690
 So remembering that you have and I'm going to talk. 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.350
 one thing they ask a lot in some 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.080
 videos if there is death for all modes 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.520
 They're just for PC, there's no more death for 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.880
 consoles 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.290
 Everything is for you, you're just clarifying. 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.450
 this because sometimes people get 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:06.620
 wondering but it 's just that takanÃ£ is e 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.140
 as soon as the ball brought the virus back 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.880
 I have driven thought I do not know if I 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.730
 I do not know if it's already meant to bring more 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.730
 fast still spoke
