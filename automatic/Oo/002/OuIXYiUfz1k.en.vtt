00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.210
 so far, chipmaker intel has 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.500
 cell phones did not have that much on the hat 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 most of the time his processors are in the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.009
 desktop computers in the pcs and macs 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 as we at home on the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.800
 to have a desk 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 that should change now it comes 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 now the first cell phone with intel 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 processor out of motorola with 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.779
 is Android operating system on 8 october 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.609
 it's on the market we have one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.810
 had a model here and let's see if it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.619
 in terms of performance and battery life 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 can really convince 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 The razer makes it first by design 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 a very good impression it is good 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 in hand is not too wide appear 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.050
 very valuable no miracles are behind 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.950
 keppler reinforced fibers with this 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 housing you can turn almost nails 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 synonymous with the display Motorola has not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.680
 Saved was a really built 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 High contrast and bright amoled 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.420
 display with 540 times 960 points 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.129
 resolution is likely for most 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.730
 applications meet it is very 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.309
 colorful 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 It is very fast and also for games 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 quite well different than at 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.340
 many other smartphones can be 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.820
 reach the interfaces very easily 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.950
 the slot for the sim card and for 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.549
 the micro sd card are outside 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.490
 a flap is hidden and next to it 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 same as the micro usb connection 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 Now we come to canned to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490
 intel processor is he really that good 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 and so fast 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.299
 Now finally has a lot of fame 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.450
 optimized and it has apparently 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.369
 paid off because the work goes along 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 This processor really only flows fluently 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.880
 fast and faster than most 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.829
 other mobile processors 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.659
 although here only one core in it 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.490
 that means she has intel whole 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.350
 work done and the best part 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 although he is so fast and although he is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 the mobile phone holds so much power 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
 still with a battery approximately 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 20 hours that means you can 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.729
 calm times for a day the charger 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.530
 also at home leave the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.960
 Back camera benefits from the new 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.329
 Intel processor so it is extreme 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.020
 ready quickly and can be up to ten 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.190
 taking pictures per second 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.560
 under the dash you can say that that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 Motorola Razr the first mobile phone with a 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.850
 Intel processor really a successful 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.650
 first work represents the screen 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.220
 is crisp hot is very bright 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 colorful 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.200
 the device is lightweight yet very robust 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.940
 the connections are all exposed 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.070
 the processor is as fast as it is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.750
 wants to have and yet he says that 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.460
 Battery does not empty so fast and that 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.260
 beautiful is the cell phone is not 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.720
 times as expensive for a pointed phone with 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.880
 android 4.1 are 400 euros by all means 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.880
 reasonable if not very cheap
