00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.069 
know heading toward the same place we
get<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> different<00:01:00.570> ways<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:00.899> what's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
get there in different ways but what's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
get there in different ways but what's
great<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> sort<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> delineates<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
great is it sort of delineates the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.649 
great is it sort of delineates the
character<00:01:03.210> isn't<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:05.129> gives<00:01:05.489> us<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> quality

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
character isn't of it gives us a quality

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
character isn't of it gives us a quality
that<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.229> bring<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that you know we bring to to the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.530 
that you know we bring to to the
characters<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> quality<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> actually

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
characters a quality that actually

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
characters a quality that actually
enhances<00:01:09.960> them<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:10.890> enhances<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
enhances them and I think enhances the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.660 
enhances them and I think enhances the
show<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.360> been<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.720> fun<00:01:13.670> touch

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
show so it's it's been really fun touch

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
show so it's it's been really fun touch
it<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:16.140> wants<00:01:16.590> it
