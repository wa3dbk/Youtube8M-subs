00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
welcome along to this short video I'm

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.700 
welcome along to this short video I'm
going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> do<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> quick<00:00:08.429> video<00:00:09.030> about

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
going to do a quick video about

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.829 
going to do a quick video about
restoring<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:11.340> device<00:00:11.759> type<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:12.960> room

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
restoring your device type in your room

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
restoring your device type in your room
so<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.109> cut<00:00:16.289> your<00:00:16.470> cloud<00:00:16.680> safe<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.340> then

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
so can you cut your cloud safe and then

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470 
so can you cut your cloud safe and then
obviously<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> need<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.609> restore<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
obviously if you need to restore it and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
obviously if you need to restore it and
probably<00:00:22.109> obviously<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> couple<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> reasons

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
probably obviously a couple of reasons

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
probably obviously a couple of reasons
why<00:00:23.789> as<00:00:23.850> well<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> reason<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.420> bet<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.900> this

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
why as well the reason I bet to do this

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.240 
why as well the reason I bet to do this
was<00:00:29.900> there's<00:00:30.900> been<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.260> update<00:00:31.800> come<00:00:32.099> out

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
was there's been a new update come out

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.810 
was there's been a new update come out
on<00:00:32.450> one<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> templates<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.820> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on one of the templates that I use and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
on one of the templates that I use and
I've<00:00:36.059> gone<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> start<00:00:37.230> real<00:00:37.590> racing<00:00:38.010> free<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I've gone to start real racing free and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.600 
I've gone to start real racing free and
I'm<00:00:38.969> getting<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> old<00:00:39.690> usual<00:00:40.260> error

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I'm getting the old usual error

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
I'm getting the old usual error
unfortunately<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> stopped<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.590> was

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
unfortunately it stopped and it was

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.459 
unfortunately it stopped and it was
doing<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> continually<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.110> obviously

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
doing it continually so it's obviously

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
doing it continually so it's obviously
to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> new<00:00:47.820> update<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.510> probably

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to do with the new update it's probably

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.209 
to do with the new update it's probably
not<00:00:48.899> compatible<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.739> yet<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.539> there's<00:00:51.539> no<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
not compatible as yet to it there's no I

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.529 
not compatible as yet to it there's no I
couldn't<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.399> any<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.940> there's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.329> way

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
couldn't see any way that there's a way

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
couldn't see any way that there's a way
to<00:00:54.570> roll<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.079> back<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> previous<00:00:56.160> version

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to roll it back to the previous version

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
to roll it back to the previous version
which<00:00:56.730> worked<00:00:56.940> fine<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.800> I've<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:58.949> done

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
which worked fine so I've actually done

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.470 
which worked fine so I've actually done
a<00:01:00.050> restore<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.980> total<00:01:02.370> reset<00:01:02.820> factory<00:01:03.270> reset

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a restore or total reset factory reset

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.390 
a restore or total reset factory reset
on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.199> tablet<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
on the tablet so I'm going to put the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.679 
on the tablet so I'm going to put the
game<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.140> works<00:01:10.380> again<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:12.060> one

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
game back so it works again that's one

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.050 
game back so it works again that's one
of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> reasons<00:01:13.290> why<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:14.280> cloud<00:01:15.320> safe<00:01:17.060> now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
