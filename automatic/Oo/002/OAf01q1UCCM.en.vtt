ones<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.390> fairly

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
ones I like this one because it's fairly

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.770

and I'm able to really fine-tune the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870 
and I'm able to really fine-tune the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
shaping to them so the initial shaping

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520 
shaping to them so the initial shaping
is<00:01:31.860> done<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.820> router<00:01:33.149> bit<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> the

angle<00:02:28.780> grinder<00:02:28.870> again<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.950> remove<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
angle grinder again to remove just the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.150 
angle grinder again to remove just the
initial<00:02:31.270> bulk<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.690> material<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.350> I'm<00:02:33.010> gonna

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
initial bulk of material and I'm gonna

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.360 
initial bulk of material and I'm gonna
go<00:02:33.550> with<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> hand<00:02:34.090> rasp<00:02:34.680> after<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.860> stage<00:02:36.130> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
go with a hand rasp after this stage and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.160 
go with a hand rasp after this stage and
then<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.790> finally<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> sanding<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
then I can finally go to the sanding I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.710 
then I can finally go to the sanding I
did<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.070> few<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> pieces<00:02:39.850> where<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> went

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
did do a few of the pieces where I went

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.810 
did do a few of the pieces where I went
from<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.260> cuts<00:02:41.470> I'll<00:02:41.650> wheel<00:02:41.830> directly<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
from the cuts I'll wheel directly to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.620 
from the cuts I'll wheel directly to
sanding<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:43.870> spending<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.500> extra<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:46.510> to

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
sanding but spending the extra three to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150 
sanding but spending the extra three to
five<00:02:46.840> minutes<00:02:47.140> per<00:02:47.230> leg<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> hand

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
five minutes per leg with the hand

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.040 
five minutes per leg with the hand
wrasse<00:02:48.370> really<00:02:48.880> saves<00:02:49.120> time<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.690> sandia

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
wrasse really saves time on the sandia

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.350 
wrasse really saves time on the sandia
it<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.739> takes<00:02:50.980> away<00:02:51.130> those<00:02:51.459> deeper<00:02:52.090> grooves

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
it just takes away those deeper grooves

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:05.580 
it just takes away those deeper grooves
that<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.810> shaping<00:02:53.440> will<00:02:53.739> gives<00:02:54.489> you

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.140 

then<00:03:06.590> again<00:03:06.860> just<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.520> front<00:03:07.640> legs<00:03:07.910> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
then again just like on the front legs I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.479 
then again just like on the front legs I
go<00:03:08.270> back<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.540> my<00:03:08.569> err<00:03:08.810> die<00:03:09.050> grinder<00:03:09.319> which<00:03:09.830> has

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
go back to my err die grinder which has

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.360 
go back to my err die grinder which has
the<00:03:10.700> cuts<00:03:10.910> all<00:03:11.260> rotary<00:03:12.260> rasp<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.830> there<00:03:13.040> again

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the cuts all rotary rasp in there again

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.940 
the cuts all rotary rasp in there again
just<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.730> fine-tune<00:03:14.270> all<00:03:14.599> all<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.680> curves

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
just to fine-tune all all the curves

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.770 
just to fine-tune all all the curves
that<00:03:16.220> transition<00:03:16.849> from<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> seat<00:03:17.330> into<00:03:17.599> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
that transition from the seat into the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.259 
that transition from the seat into the
leg<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.349> just<00:03:18.890> slightly<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.580> leg<00:03:19.790> into

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
leg and just slightly up the leg into

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.660 
leg and just slightly up the leg into
the<00:03:20.480> into<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> tapered<00:03:21.950> radius<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.519> goes

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the into the tapered radius that goes

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.380 
the into the tapered radius that goes
from<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.970> bottom<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.569> top<00:03:23.599> of<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.019> leg<00:03:28.390> so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
from the bottom to the top of the leg so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.940 
from the bottom to the top of the leg so
now<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.569> have<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.840> clamped<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:30.380> my<00:03:30.530> table<00:03:30.709> which

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
now I have it clamped on my table which

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.440 
now I have it clamped on my table which
is<00:03:30.980> slightly<00:03:31.340> lower<00:03:31.640> which<00:03:32.060> gives<00:03:32.269> me<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
is slightly lower which gives me a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.030 
is slightly lower which gives me a
little<00:03:32.660> better<00:03:32.870> leverage<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.650> better<00:03:33.890> eye

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
little better leverage and a better eye

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.000 
little better leverage and a better eye
view<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.519> what<00:03:35.390> I'm<00:03:35.510> trying<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.840> shape<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.950> I'm

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
view of what I'm trying to shape and I'm

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.059 
view of what I'm trying to shape and I'm
just<00:03:37.250> removing<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.900> really<00:03:39.230> deep<00:03:39.530> grinding

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
just removing the really deep grinding

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.830 
just removing the really deep grinding
marks<00:03:40.370> at<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.610> cuts<00:03:40.819> all<00:03:41.000> wheel<00:03:41.239> leaves<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
marks at the cuts all wheel leaves and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.460 
marks at the cuts all wheel leaves and
of<00:03:42.049> course<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> fully<00:03:42.830> round<00:03:44.470> tapered

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
of course it's a fully round tapered

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.860 
of course it's a fully round tapered
