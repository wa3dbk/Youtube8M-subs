there's a checker mapped if in there I

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
there's a checker mapped if in there I

put it in to your source images within

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.860 
put it in to your source images within
your<00:00:36.989> project<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.860> gun<00:00:38.070> project<00:00:38.660> ok<00:00:39.660> once

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
your project your gun project ok once

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.869 
your project your gun project ok once
you've<00:00:40.020> done<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.820> we're<00:00:41.820> ready<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> move<00:00:43.050> on

you've done that we're ready to move on
so<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.289> just

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so what we're going to do is I'm just

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.229 
so what we're going to do is I'm just
going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> show<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
going to show you how it's going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.799 
going to show you how it's going to
texture<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> rendering<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
texture it if you go to rendering and

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
texture it if you go to rendering and
check<00:00:51.809> check<00:00:52.440> Lambert<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:54.350> just<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
check check Lambert and just go into the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.200 
check check Lambert and just go into the
color<00:00:57.149> properties<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.309> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> file

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
color properties and going to the file

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
color properties and going to the file
now<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.559> file<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.489> open

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
now the file that you're about to open

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.210 
now the file that you're about to open
is<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> check<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.390> map<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
is a check a map but it's actually a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.020 
is a check a map but it's actually a
little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:07.189> precise<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> checker

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
little bit more precise than the checker

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
little bit more precise than the checker
map<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.890> Maya<00:01:11.189> supplies

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
map which is this one that Maya supplies

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.300 
map which is this one that Maya supplies
so<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.570> why<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:12.810> included<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so that's why I've included it here so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.710 
so that's why I've included it here so
be<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.150> pick<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:15.689> up

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
be going there and just pick that one up

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
be going there and just pick that one up
from<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.140> source<00:01:16.409> images<00:01:17.960> click<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
from your source images click on that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.520 
from your source images click on that
and<00:01:19.350> open<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880 

looks<00:01:29.190> like<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.460> hope<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> there

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.070 

okay<00:01:33.640> I'll<00:01:34.360> find<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.810> notice<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:37.360> well<00:01:37.630> okay

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
okay I'll find it notice as well okay

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.120 
okay I'll find it notice as well okay
that's<00:01:38.320> good<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.570> close<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.630> up<00:01:40.870> now<00:01:41.680> if<00:01:41.979> we

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
that's good and close that up now if we

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.850 
that's good and close that up now if we
look<00:01:42.159> at<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.460> model<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.560> yeah

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
look at the model we can see that yeah

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.969 
look at the model we can see that yeah
around<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.400> barrel<00:01:45.850> that's<00:01:46.240> pretty<00:01:46.630> good

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
around the barrel that's pretty good

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.920 
around the barrel that's pretty good
let's<00:01:47.979> check<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:48.610> quite<00:01:48.880> nicely<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
let's check at that quite nicely and the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.499 
let's check at that quite nicely and the
front<00:01:50.580> although<00:01:51.580> they're<00:01:51.850> squares<00:01:52.240> and

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
front although they're squares and

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.600 
front although they're squares and
they've<00:01:52.630> gone<00:01:52.780> kind<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.170> rectangular<00:01:53.710> so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
they've gone kind of rectangular so

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.830 
they've gone kind of rectangular so
that's<00:01:54.790> obviously<00:01:54.940> not<00:01:55.210> going<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.600> be<00:01:55.690> good

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
that's obviously not going to be good

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.410 
that's obviously not going to be good
enough<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.170> use<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.909> know<00:01:58.060> you've<00:01:58.210> got<00:01:58.360> a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
enough to use and you know you've got a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.620 
enough to use and you know you've got a
load<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:59.020> warping<00:01:59.440> all<00:01:59.590> over<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.360> we<00:02:01.479> need

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
load of warping all over it so we need

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.800 
load of warping all over it so we need
to<00:02:01.780> fix<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:05.080> we're<00:02:05.229> going<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:06.360> sew<00:02:07.360> ok<00:02:07.750> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
to fix this so we're going to sew ok so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.930 
to fix this so we're going to sew ok so
that's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.259> checker<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.830> there<00:02:09.160> that's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
that's the checker back there that's

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's the checker back there that's
late<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.539> our<00:02:10.600> model<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.590> we're<00:02:11.709> going<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
late on to our model now we're going to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.759 
late on to our model now we're going to
start<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.340> lay<00:02:12.519> out<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.970> UVs<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.680> I'm

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
start to lay out the UVs for it so I'm

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.530 
start to lay out the UVs for it so I'm
going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.950> pick<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.370> front<00:02:15.940> view<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.330> side

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
going to pick the front view the side

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140 
going to pick the front view the side
view<00:02:16.810> there<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.290> I'm<00:02:17.350> going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.560> go<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.150> make

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
view there and I'm going to go to make

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
view there and I'm going to go to make
sure<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.600> i'm<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.930> polygons<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.130> i'm

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
sure that i'm on polygons and then i'm

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.960 
sure that i'm on polygons and then i'm
going<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:22.410> create<00:02:23.410> UVs<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.550> I'm<00:02:24.790> going

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
going to go to create UVs and I'm going

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.190 
going to go to create UVs and I'm going
to<00:02:25.000> go<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.600> planar<00:02:26.410> mapping<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.959> i'm<00:02:29.110> going

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
to go for planar mapping and i'm going

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.410 
to go for planar mapping and i'm going
to<00:02:29.290> select<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.650> little<00:02:29.860> box<00:02:30.100> there<00:02:30.430> now<00:02:31.269> i'm

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
to select the little box there now i'm

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.080 
to select the little box there now i'm
in<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.720> side<00:02:31.959> view<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> want<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> go<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
in the side view so I want to go on the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.259 
in the side view so I want to go on the
z<00:02:34.360> axis<00:02:35.100> I'm<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> select<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.180> I'm

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
z axis I'm going to select there and I'm

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.530 
z axis I'm going to select there and I'm
going<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.450> project<00:02:38.130> now<00:02:39.130> already<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:40.329> can<00:02:40.360> see

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
going to project now already you can see

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.890 
going to project now already you can see
that<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.079> better<00:02:43.829> but<00:02:44.829> if<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:45.190> check<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.519> top

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that it's better but if we check the top

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.650 
that it's better but if we check the top
that's<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> slide<00:02:47.530> across<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.360> we<00:02:49.480> need

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
that's going to slide across so we need

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.350 
that's going to slide across so we need
to<00:02:49.810> break<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.290> all<00:02:50.410> up<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.329> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
to break it all up but you can see that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.360 
to break it all up but you can see that
the<00:02:52.570> planar<00:02:53.110> mapping<00:02:53.380> there<00:02:53.739> has<00:02:54.100> done<00:02:54.340> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the planar mapping there has done a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.430 
the planar mapping there has done a
fairly<00:02:54.700> good<00:02:54.850> job<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> side<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.170> we

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
fairly good job on the side and we

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.910 
fairly good job on the side and we
probably<00:02:56.680> would<00:02:57.130> want<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.459> keep<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.769> we

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
probably would want to keep that but we

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.130 
probably would want to keep that but we
can<00:03:00.070> go<00:03:00.250> into<00:03:00.430> ow<00:03:00.610> UV<00:03:01.540> editor<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.600> have<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> look

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
can go into ow UV editor and have a look

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.400 
can go into ow UV editor and have a look
at<00:03:05.500> how<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.070> all<00:03:06.250> been<00:03:06.400> put<00:03:06.610> together<00:03:06.790> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
at how it's all been put together and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.229 
at how it's all been put together and
then<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.530> can<00:03:08.680> start<00:03:08.980> breaking<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.760> object

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
then we can start breaking this object

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.319 
then we can start breaking this object
part<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.900> laying<00:03:11.440> out<00:03:11.680> different<00:03:12.160> UV<00:03:13.030> set

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
part and laying out different UV set

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.060 
part and laying out different UV set
cylindrical<00:03:14.140> etc<00:03:15.010> forum<00:03:16.739> laying<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:17.920> all

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
cylindrical etc forum laying this all

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.530 
cylindrical etc forum laying this all
out<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.670> nice<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:18.850> flat<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.239> it's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
out so it's nice and flat so it's

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.150 
out so it's nice and flat so it's
basically<00:03:19.720> taking<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> object<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.739> breaking

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
basically taking the object and breaking

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.030 
basically taking the object and breaking
up<00:03:21.280> which<00:03:21.880> will<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.239> doing<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:23.110> stages<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
up which will be doing in stages in the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.430 
up which will be doing in stages in the
next<00:03:24.340> lesson<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.299> really<00:03:25.780> important<00:03:26.320> that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
next lesson it's really important that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.870 
next lesson it's really important that
you<00:03:26.620> understand<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:27.670> going<00:03:27.850> to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
you understand this so I'm going to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.060 
you understand this so I'm going to
spend<00:03:28.209> maybe<00:03:28.660> two<00:03:29.049> or<00:03:29.079> three<00:03:29.260> lessons<00:03:29.739> just

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
spend maybe two or three lessons just

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.190 
spend maybe two or three lessons just
showing<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:30.670> about<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.359> eat<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.810> breaking

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
showing you about you eat and breaking

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.960 
showing you about you eat and breaking
them<00:03:32.350> up<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.100> get<00:03:33.220> into<00:03:33.489> your<00:03:33.549> head<00:03:33.730> was

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
them up so you get into your head was

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.840 
them up so you get into your head was
actually<00:03:34.269> happening<00:03:34.510> behind<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.230> scenes<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
actually happening behind the scenes and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.759 
actually happening behind the scenes and
then<00:03:37.030> those<00:03:37.450> UV<00:03:37.900> maps<00:03:38.170> that<00:03:38.410> we've<00:03:38.560> created

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
then those UV maps that we've created

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.580 
then those UV maps that we've created
for<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.489> object<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:40.750> be<00:03:40.780> exported

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
for this object can be exported

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.640 
for this object can be exported
taking<00:03:42.010> into<00:03:42.129> Photoshop<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:44.080> can<00:03:44.260> apply

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
taking into Photoshop and you can apply

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.490 
taking into Photoshop and you can apply
all<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.430> colorings<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.120> textures<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.900> from

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
all the colorings and textures and from

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.000 
all the colorings and textures and from
those<00:03:47.709> maps<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.430> create<00:03:49.319> bump<00:03:50.319> maps<00:03:50.680> or

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
those maps you can create bump maps or

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.880 
those maps you can create bump maps or
normal<00:03:51.819> maps<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.750> game<00:03:53.170> will<00:03:53.379> be<00:03:53.500> doing<00:03:53.739> that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
normal maps the game will be doing that

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.280 
normal maps the game will be doing that
as<00:03:54.040> well<00:03:54.220> too<00:03:54.790> without<00:03:55.300> having<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.780> add<00:03:55.989> any

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
as well too without having to add any

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.190 
as well too without having to add any
extra<00:03:56.580> geometry<00:03:57.580> into<00:03:57.730> our<00:03:58.090> model<00:03:58.450> we<00:03:58.629> can

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
extra geometry into our model we can

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.369 
extra geometry into our model we can
create<00:03:59.440> bumps<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.549> ridges<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.060> things<00:04:01.379> and

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
create bumps and ridges and things and

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.660 
create bumps and ridges and things and
textures<00:04:02.890> for<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.160> gun<00:04:03.310> handle<00:04:03.870> very<00:04:04.870> simply

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
textures for the gun handle very simply

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.470 
textures for the gun handle very simply
very<00:04:06.670> simply<00:04:07.000> do<00:04:07.390> but<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:09.459> takes<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:10.000> while<00:04:10.180> to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
very simply do but it takes a while to

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.479 
very simply do but it takes a while to
understand<00:04:11.080> what's<00:04:11.319> actually<00:04:11.500> going<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.160> so

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
understand what's actually going on so

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.009 
understand what's actually going on so
I'm<00:04:12.549> going<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.760> take<00:04:13.269> my<00:04:13.480> time<00:04:13.750> with<00:04:13.810> this

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
I'm going to take my time with this

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.219 
I'm going to take my time with this
section<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.860> not<00:04:15.670> rush<00:04:15.910> through<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.269> it's<00:04:17.139> a

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
section and not rush through it it's a

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.830 
section and not rush through it it's a
nice<00:04:17.380> simple<00:04:17.680> model<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.459> it'll<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.299> quite<00:04:19.810> easy

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
nice simple model so it'll be quite easy

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.790 
nice simple model so it'll be quite easy
to<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:21.190> work<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.360> hopefully<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.500> will<00:04:23.590> take

you into doing more complex models with

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.790
