00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
do and you can work the top you can work

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
do and you can work the top you can work
the<00:01:13.799> bottom<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.549> top<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.360> bottom<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> same

the bottom or top and bottom the same

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
the bottom or top and bottom the same
time<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.950> rotate<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.330> then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
time I like to rotate it around and then

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
time I like to rotate it around and then
and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.869> squeeze<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> start<00:01:19.650> working<00:01:19.770> the

and then squeeze and start working the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
and then squeeze and start working the
top<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.600> too<00:01:21.810> long

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
top now you don't want do this too long

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050 
top now you don't want do this too long
because<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.549> your

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
concentrate diluted with water so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350 
concentrate diluted with water so
halfway<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.240> know

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
halfway through it if you just you know

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
halfway through it if you just you know
you're<00:01:30.810> impatient<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> razor

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
you're impatient and you do have a razor
blade<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.479> ahead<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.750> slice<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> down<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
blade and go ahead and slice it down the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
blade and go ahead and slice it down the
center<00:01:34.939> I'll<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.090> careful<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
center I'll be careful because this you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
center I'll be careful because this you
can't<00:01:37.439> cut<00:01:37.590> yourself<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.250> easy<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.640> this

can't cut yourself really easy with this
technique<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.229> splice<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.070> open<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
technique but splice it open and that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
technique but splice it open and that
way<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.840> access<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> cotton<00:01:43.740> really

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
way you can access the cotton really

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.789 
way you can access the cotton really
quickly<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> drip<00:01:46.500> stage

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
quickly then you can have the drip stage

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
quickly then you can have the drip stage
start<00:01:47.340> working<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.570> cotton<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.860> want

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
start working on the cotton and you want

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
start working on the cotton and you want
to<00:01:50.070> try<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> rip<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> away<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.540> tear<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.840> away

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to try to rip it away and tear it away

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.940 
to try to rip it away and tear it away
from<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.159> plastic<00:01:53.909> sheeting<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.079> actually

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
from the plastic sheeting that actually

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.030 
from the plastic sheeting that actually
does<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> stick<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
does have it stick to it so you and it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.130 
does have it stick to it so you and it
will<00:01:59.700> actually<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.329> some<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.719> ink<00:02:00.930> on

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
will actually have some of your ink on

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
will actually have some of your ink on
that<00:02:01.409> plastic<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
