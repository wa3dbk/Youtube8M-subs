kind<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> sucks<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.719> probably

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
kind of sucks and you know probably

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.860 
kind of sucks and you know probably
should<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.410> expected<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.100> didn't<00:00:50.870> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
should have expected that by didn't and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
should have expected that by didn't and
I<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> dragon<00:00:52.770> blur<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I do go for the dragon blur here and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
I do go for the dragon blur here and
lucky<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.910> me<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> critical<00:00:55.110> hit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
lucky for me I do get the critical hit

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
lucky for me I do get the critical hit
so<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.680> force<00:00:55.980> him<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.399> switch<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.660> his

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so i will force him to switch out of his

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
so i will force him to switch out of his
yanmega<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.559> probably<00:00:58.890> could<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.430> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
yanmega here probably could have just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.189 
yanmega here probably could have just
killed<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.600> instead<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> switching

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
out you know obviously because of the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
out you know obviously because of the
speed<00:01:03.329> boost<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.350> killed<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
speed boost it would have killed me I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.649 
speed boost it would have killed me I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I don't know why he just didn't kill my

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
I don't know why he just didn't kill my
Dragonite<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> let<00:01:23.490> his<00:01:23.670> gal<00:01:23.850> mega<00:01:24.030> die<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
next turn I mean I probably could have

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
next turn I mean I probably could have
done<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:26.640> damage<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.180> uh<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
done a lot more damage with that uh you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
done a lot more damage with that uh you
know<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.439> didn't<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:29.970> he<00:01:30.060> goes

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
know but he didn't do it so then he goes

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I go back into my dragon head here

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.390 
I go back into my dragon head here
because<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.189> dead

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
because I know it's going to be dead

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.630 
because I know it's going to be dead
father<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> he<00:01:40.079> goes<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> u-turn<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
father and he goes to the u-turn here I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.010 
father and he goes to the u-turn here I
wasn't<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.119> expecting<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.899> on

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
wasn't really expecting that to be on

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
wasn't really expecting that to be on
the<00:01:43.110> dimension<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> begin<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.390> my<00:01:45.390> Nagi

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the dimension to begin with so my Nagi

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
the dimension to begin with so my Nagi
does<00:01:45.990> faint<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.890> quit<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.759> know

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
does faint it does get quit but you know

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.830 
does faint it does get quit but you know
I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> cook<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
I don't really think the cook with a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
I don't really think the cook with a
matter<00:01:49.049> consider<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.680> had<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.100> 59<00:01:50.490> HP<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
matter consider they had like 59 HP and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
matter consider they had like 59 HP and
he<00:01:51.869> goes<00:01:52.020> into<00:01:52.170> his<00:01:52.259> rod<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.649> wash<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
he goes into his rod and wash and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
he goes into his rod and wash and
predicting<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.909> ahead<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.659> with

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
predicting that I go ahead and go with

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
predicting that I go ahead and go with
my<00:01:55.140> breloom<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.969> just

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
my breloom here because I was just

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.190 
my breloom here because I was just
thinking<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> seed

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
thinking I was going to go with the seed

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080 
thinking I was going to go with the seed
bomb<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> kill<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.890> bum<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.670> Amash<00:01:59.909> as

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
bomb and kill this bum what Amash as

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
bomb and kill this bum what Amash as
quick<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.360> possible<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.950> didn't<00:02:02.280> expect

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
quick as possible but I didn't expect

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
quick as possible but I didn't expect
the<00:02:02.640> volt<00:02:02.820> switch<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:03.719> switches<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the volt switch so he switches out and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280 
the volt switch so he switches out and
he<00:02:04.979> goes<00:02:05.189> into<00:02:05.490> his<00:02:05.700> Gliscor<00:02:06.570> once<00:02:06.780> again<00:02:07.079> I'm

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
he goes into his Gliscor once again I'm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.090 
he goes into his Gliscor once again I'm
pretty<00:02:07.860> obviously<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.340> did<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:08.879> the

a bad thing but I can't kill the glue
score<00:02:31.340> as<00:02:31.460> fast<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.940> would<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.300> which

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
score as fast as I would like to which

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.200 
score as fast as I would like to which
kind<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.530> sucks<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:34.850> gonna<00:02:34.940> go<00:02:35.060> ahead<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
kind of sucks so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
go for the focus punch here on the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.700 
go for the focus punch here on the
dimension<00:02:37.840> because<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.990> know<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.230> asleep<00:02:39.470> and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
dimension because I know it's asleep and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.920 
dimension because I know it's asleep and
I'm<00:02:39.800> gonna<00:02:39.950> get<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.670> more<00:02:41.480> likely<00:02:41.690> than

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
I'm gonna get it in and more likely than

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.420 
I'm gonna get it in and more likely than
not<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.200> focus<00:02:42.350> punch<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.920> gonna<00:02:43.010> kill<00:02:43.400> it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
not the focus punch is gonna kill it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.730 
not the focus punch is gonna kill it
let's<00:02:43.790> see<00:02:44.030> here<00:02:44.540> yeah<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> focus<00:02:45.410> punch<00:02:45.560> go

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
let's see here yeah the focus punch go

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 
let's see here yeah the focus punch go
ahead<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> goes<00:02:46.430> ahead<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.090> kills<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
ahead and goes ahead and kills the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.890 
ahead and goes ahead and kills the
dimension<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.600> point<00:02:50.810> I'm

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
dimension and and this point I'm

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.870 
dimension and and this point I'm
thinking<00:02:51.020> okay<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:51.950> he's<00:02:52.160> lost<00:02:52.370> asleep

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
thinking okay so now he's lost asleep

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.070 
thinking okay so now he's lost asleep
plausibility<00:02:53.330> I'm<00:02:53.600> just<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.870> go<00:02:53.930> ahead

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
plausibility I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
plausibility I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:54.170> go<00:02:54.320> for<00:02:54.470> another<00:02:54.560> sport<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.520> he<00:02:55.790> gets<00:02:56.000> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
and go for another sport so he gets a
