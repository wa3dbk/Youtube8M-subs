00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello to all today we 're going 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 speak whitened scares the pumpkin 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.760
 pokemon spectrum x and y 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 she has a new double type 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 spectrum plant share with seals 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.179
 between a double title there are a lot of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 weaknesses which is rather a pity 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.140
 I obviously crossed funk 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 looks like a little defense balm 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 especially that these pokémon has very good 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.660
 statistics 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 he has an excellent defense an attack 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 and very good pv even if the rest 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 of these statistics is a little bit 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 more way it's still not already 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.440
 a lot of very positive things 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 but be careful suppoter lead a small 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.399
 particularity there are four forms 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 different with each time a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.160
 small change in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.200
 statistics 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 basically the four forms are four 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 pages of different routes sites 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 the smaller she is, the more the pokemon is 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.809
 fast but the less he has father and the more she 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 is fat plus pokemon have spotted and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 the more it will be slow but after you do not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 do not worry you can have a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.489
 little pumpkin and be quite 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.750
 performing well even if personally seen 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.519
 that I advise you to play it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.000
 defensively I prefer big ones 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.280
 pumpkins 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.900
 especially if his speed is correct 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 nor is it excellent 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 will be easily overtaken by others 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570
 pokemon 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.180
 I find that so more interests 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 to further maximize the pv where 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 Bauchi Funk seems a little bit 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.190
 less interesting it's at the level of its 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
 special abilities 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.950
 he may pick or dig 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.229
 insomnia pickup it's useless 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 Insomnia fight is good but it's 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.770
 really for very specific cases and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.660
 in the majority of masters it will not be 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.090
 not very useful so I advise you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.340
 rather to go on excavations which allows 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.869
 to see the opponent's object the other 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.119
 advantage of this pokemon is that it 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.220
 learns end of support attacks and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.039
 it is notably the first pokemon to 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.050
 learn wind who win and wisp 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.030
 and that I think it's really cool 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.399
 why it's very useful and good because 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.289
 that was stolen it burns opponent is a 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.479
 burned opponent he sees his attack 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.770
 divided by two with bronchitis wheels and 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.050
 who has a very good defense that's 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.460
 rather nice especially that vampire is gonna 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.420
 take it from life to regenerate 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.039
 your pokemon 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.320
 so let's go on these two 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.180
 attacks in third attack what 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.100
 seems rather not bad these shelters 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.680
 why because as I come you 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.930
 explain it to an opponent who has to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910
 times the burn and the vampires she goes 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 lose a lot of his life at each end 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.470
 tour and that's rather interesting 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.120
 from the shelter camp we win a ride in 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.769
 last attack we can leave on 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.299
 something a little more offensive 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.810
 to say to have an attack that makes 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.700
 damages 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.959
 I recommend Antilles who a 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.670
 new attack of the sixth 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 generation which in addition is of the type 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.000
 spectrum especially that it's an attack 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.829
 which works as a tunnel 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.110
 there is a first round where your pokemon 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.970
 disappears to attack the turn after 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.050
 and that again it helps to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.270
 enjoy all 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.700
 you have installed on the opponent but 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.380
 we can also use drop shadow which 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.540
 is an attack has priority hit his flush 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.090
 so always first prom grain 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.280
 calm in seeds or even gigas have known 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.960
 If you want the special toy our 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.580
 pumpkins in case will not normally 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.230
 bad at all and should be able to be placed 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.540
 easily against opponents 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.730
 physical but for that you also have to be 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.830
 attentive to the surveys and the nature 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.260
 I advise you to invest a maximum 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.090
 in PV a lot in defense and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.190
 possibly a little bit of funds 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.250
 special if you are afraid of being too 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.150
 cool for nature calm or relax 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 it's really not bad 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.780
 and if you play it special even if it 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.470
 is a little less good in the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.900
 statistical 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.790
 we must prefer insured for the object 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.380
 necessarily the remains it works very very 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 good but it's not the only solution 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.890
 especially if you have to pay attention and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.940
 have different objects there to 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.890
 other possible choices 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.080
 we can for example consider the breakage 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.240
 crust that has a rather youtube object that 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.160
 will hurt the pokémon attacking you with 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.140
 physical attacks and that's not it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.540
 bad at all considering the way we play 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.670
 our pokemon we can also think of 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.160
 use the big root an object 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.650
 often a little misunderstood which increases the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.060
 theft of life in general bleached 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.520
 Funk will work well with 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.350
 pokemon of the normal type to protect them 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
 combat attacks I think for example 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.910
 at once Pashmina language or even 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.650
 media this even if it's a little bit 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.750
 fragile that will work quite a bit 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.580
 all here I hope that's how 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.850
 play on this new pokemon you will have 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.320
 enjoyed 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.030
 I think it's a pokemon 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.470
 especially interesting me who 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.330
 love playing defensive 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.180
 I find it really not bad with a 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.670
 double very difficult to play but who has 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 conducted 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.060
 if he is well placed to make 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.110
 carnage but tell you very soon 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.110
 for other videos
