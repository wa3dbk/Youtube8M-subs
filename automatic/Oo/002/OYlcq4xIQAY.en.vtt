00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 well it her whole world seneca 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.059
 case and we find ourselves today for 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.920
 a special community mac video 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 so there even community game for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.449
 those who do not know it was started 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.680
 last week and I wanted to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 do a little point with you then I 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 did not think to do it so quickly 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.699
 to tell you I thought I was waiting for a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.490
 little may you wait maybe fifteen 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.689
 days by the way the next points 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 will be done surely every fifteen 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 dad days before but I wanted to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.149
 to show you a little how that's 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.219
 is happening and that's because it's a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.790
 week now that the map is launched 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.980
 and it unfolds pretty well for those 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 who had already seen the video you had 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.129
 saw the sign but you did not see the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.989
 wall right below there so that's the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.820
 wall I called that wall of heroes that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.870
 you are too much how to call that in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 anyway it's the wall where all 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 participants will be able to put their 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 nicks could you can see there are 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 mine there is the sky of the 38 that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.820
 you also know through the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 videos the adventure videos you have 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.960
 totals 82 t who already participated we will 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.820
 see them a little bit what he did too 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 you have fendick a kraft starbucks who 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.670
 did a really awesome thing to me 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 I find it really great what he has 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.640
 done and you also have the water 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.810
 he had forgotten to put his little name 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 on the kick panel it's me who 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 to add it and so here we go 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 make a small point to the goal of a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.950
 week to see a little bit of how 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.750
 begins to evolve 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 when I showed you the map that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.689
 had absolutely nothing and the first 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.400
 something to replay here to hide a little bit 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.240
 which is above me I'm not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.439
 show you right away 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 and the first thing that was built 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.360
 so this is this house we know the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 sky house he built 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.610
 we'll do a little trick like that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 do not go into the interiors of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 houses because I'm going to put you the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
 map to download in fact just in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 and below in the description 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 as usual and like that you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 will you also be able to visit a little 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.009
 a little all these houses but there was 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.360
 something that I wanted to do 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.890
 show but I'll show you just 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 after I will try to go in 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.369
 the order of the constructions is thus to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.509
 you have the little sky house with 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.159
 a small tennis court with a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.450
 pool and then with some stuff to 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.649
 inside that I leave you the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.869
 discover it can be seen a little bit 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.950
 see it's interior decoration 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.440
 are you know for those who follow 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.879
 the adventures followed sky we 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.650
 nicknamed valÃ©rie damidot likes to do well 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.470
 a little 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.939
 deco so that's what it was 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.730
 first house that had been built 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.239
 so on the there I showed you too 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 show who was built on the map 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.560
 the community map so then the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 second house it was total toto 80 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.769
 dt so we built a dojo 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.209
 really beautiful too really very 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.379
 big while a sun has made its 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.209
 house at the beginning he told me that he 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.859
 was already already big and it looks 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.659
 it's not bad it's big and where and when 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.019
 I saw the dojo arrived I do wawel 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.280
 ok so it's twice as big so 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.180
 here he put some panels I you 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.859
 I said I would not like inside 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.430
 why do I go back this is for you 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.280
 it's yours 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.629
 it's up to you to find out here we go 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.069
 show a little like that like that 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.389
 it hides in addition what is behind there 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.889
 down I do not want to show you even though 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.450
 I think that if you come back on the 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.519
 video you can see it because 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.530
 it's not easy to hide it but 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.700
 this is really the second 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.829
 construction that is really huge that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 is really beautiful and so it's the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.920
 second dojo the second the second 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.569
 construction and a little dojo that is 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.030
 really loosely friendly exception 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.269
 cherry tree like that next to the building 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.260
 it's really very pretty it's very pretty g8 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.180
 and interiors if it's really not bad 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.180
 and that's the third one 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.620
 years old server build that was 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.519
 done by iolo place that had not put 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.569
 are as I told you all to 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.579
 the time in the game you're adding 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.190
 alone do not worry and so that's his 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.019
 double- roofed house I want 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.329
 to say it's pretty pretty too so 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.129
 just under the panel like this is 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.389
 rather well spent well and she 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.010
 is rather pretty even the interior is 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.740
 rather big in addition there is really 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.530
 space and 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.730
 and so here and well I find for 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.070
 the moment more for the constructions 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.990
 that have been done is it's finally 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.950
 really well that the aisles the 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.630
 people will be able to really build 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.580
 respected their location they have not 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.110
 taken neither enough space nor too much 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.610
 are really could have built this 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.780
 that they did what they wanted 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.430
 take half of the map 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.410
 honestly I 'm really happy with the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.000
 way it goes forward then of course 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.650
 is that the beginning is really that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.480
 that the beginning it's been a week she has 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.460
 turned to three people he's going to have 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480
 a lot still to see on the 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.520
 even I hope I hope you go 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.710
 really creative and bring us to everything 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.970
 the world because I already followed it 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.560
 sure i'm first to discover them so 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.460
 it makes me I'm really impatient 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 every time to find out what you 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.220
 did but for others 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.370
 who will see the video and who 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.780
 are going to be able to download the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.140
 map because it will be corrected in 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.280
 downloading every two weeks they 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.500
 go they go I really hope they 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.480
 will make this great pleasure to discover 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.560
 all your constructions and finally the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.520
 last thing I wanted you 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.970
 show me that I really find 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.890
 awesome it's just this thing that lies 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.500
 just here in front of me 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:45.010
 but it's a storyteller it's a storyteller who 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.060
 will allow us to see how the 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.650
 time that it actually took to make 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.150
 all the buildings so that's 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.380
 maybe not really stuck to the minute 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.640
 close up strong and I ask thoroughly 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.380
 says because it's fun says kraft 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.670
 starbucks who did that to us to go 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.490
 see on his channel there are plenty of tutorials 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.750
 in redstone rather good and more 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.910
 so he made us this storyteller 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.980
 absolutely huge but absolutely 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.350
 great that allows us to see the weather 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.700
 which flows on the map 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.740
 there is a pretty redstone system 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.220
 complex inside me I find it 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.360
 really really good and that's it 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.610
 you see you have the time that 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.770
 flows and who goes that will allow us 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.850
 to see how long it took for 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.140
 do the map so we will not have the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.990
 early constructions this is a small 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.130
 little damage but it's not serious it's 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.050
 always and I find it rather nice 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.230
 looks like a big awakening with his head just 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.160
 above so went to visit his chain 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.810
 because there are plenty of you redstone 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.860
 6 for those who want to do even for 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.180
 to make maps and all that you have 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.870
 lots of little tricks that Redstone 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.900
 are pretty good 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.510
 so that's the beginning of the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.220
 Community map is 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.720
 a rather short video because ben y'a 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.650
 not a lot of construction 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.620
 but I really wanted to 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.850
 share quickly with you 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.110
 because here is the beginning of the map 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.060
 running around that's coming back to me 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.860
 so for the next updates 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.150
 in quotes to see a little 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.520
 how is the map going? 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.900
 fifteen days I think not before a month 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.250
 is really I have a huge thing and that 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.490
 the map is immensely circulated in the 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.780
 week 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.310
 because in addition what has been there 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.690
 is that the mapa not too drag in 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.070
 did I left them two days to 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.700
 everyone and then in general it took 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.050
 one day 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.090
 so it was pretty good 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.670
 allowed several people to 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.750
 have it and suddenly it has turned 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.290
 much faster than I 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.390
 thought at first so so here it was 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.800
 to do a little trick for the mob of 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.720
 the community amap I will you the 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.820
 download this already that you 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.200
 will simply move 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.120
 knowing that it's always me of course 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.950
 which is the real map the main fashion 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.780
 is that as it was explained in the 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.100
 first video the map pro goes through me 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.260
 permanently and it's me who you 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.430
 the sends so does not build anything on the 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.140
 map that you can download because 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.360
 that anyway it will not keep 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.100
 it's clear there's only one map that 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.640
 Paris coming back and if not it's even 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.470
 more trouble 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.440
 everyone to make his construction of his 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.900
 side and then after a while we get 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.190
 will come out more so here's to listen 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.210
 I hope in any case that the video you 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.940
 will have more time we'll expose on 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.110
 the fundy head i hope the video 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.660
 I hope you will enjoy the map 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.640
 community also pleases you 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.110

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.460

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.950
 had a nice overview in addition to here from 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.350
