throwing<00:02:41.569> Machado

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
throwing Machado

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.220 
throwing Machado
it<00:02:43.440> seemed<00:02:44.040> pretty<00:02:44.400> obvious<00:02:44.910> there<00:02:45.750> after<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it seemed pretty obvious there after I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.740

saw the replay and that ball was
actually<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.560> Machado<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:50.550> he<00:02:50.670> just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
actually by Machado and then he just
