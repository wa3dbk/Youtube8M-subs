of crap the kind that you would use or

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
of crap the kind that you would use or
snare<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.099> kind<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.460> your<00:00:29.669> use<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.980> my<00:00:32.390> video

snare the kind that your use in my video
that<00:00:33.660> i've<00:00:33.750> posted<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.769> a<00:00:35.699> simple<00:00:36.510> snare<00:00:37.170> trap

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
that i've posted of a simple snare trap

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.549 
that i've posted of a simple snare trap
spring-trap<00:00:39.089> I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:42.079> because<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
spring-trap I think it was because I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.340 
spring-trap I think it was because I
said<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> video<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.269> wouldn't<00:00:46.199> be

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
said in the video that you wouldn't be

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.900 
said in the video that you wouldn't be
using<00:00:46.879> string<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.600> actual<00:00:49.670> but<00:00:50.670> which

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
using string as the actual but which

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.930 
using string as the actual but which
goes<00:00:51.149> around<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> animal<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.640> i'll<00:00:53.640> show<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
goes around the animal and i'll show you

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
goes around the animal and i'll show you
how<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.359> that<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:56.210> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
how to make that but right now all you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
how to make that but right now all you
need<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:59.120> something<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.780> cut<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
need is something that you can cut the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.740 
need is something that you can cut the
wire<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:02.210> some<00:01:03.210> snare<00:01:03.899> wire<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.940> wire<00:01:05.940> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
wire with some snare wire or wire that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.740 
wire with some snare wire or wire that
will<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> job<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:09.270> piece<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> rope

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
will do the job and a piece of rope

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.510 
will do the job and a piece of rope
first<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.899> all

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.969 

you<00:01:16.090> want<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.049> right<00:01:17.229> length<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.740> wire

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
you want to get the right length of wire

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.190 
you want to get the right length of wire
and<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:21.280> depends<00:01:21.789> on<00:01:21.969> what<00:01:22.149> size<00:01:22.539> animal<00:01:23.079> you

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
and this depends on what size animal you

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.419 
and this depends on what size animal you
are<00:01:23.229> trying<00:01:23.469> to<00:01:23.560> catch<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.920> want<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.189> make

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
are trying to catch but you want to make

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.840 
are trying to catch but you want to make
it<00:01:27.640> big<00:01:27.850> enough<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.860> make<00:01:33.069> a<00:01:33.280> loop<00:01:33.520> that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
it big enough for to make a loop that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.449 
it big enough for to make a loop that
will<00:01:34.479> go<00:01:34.840> around<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.530> animal's<00:01:36.009> head<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:39.189> make

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
will go around the animal's head so make

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:47.970 
will go around the animal's head so make
it<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.969> right<00:01:40.149> size

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.550 

say<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.580> want<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.120> do<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.420> big<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.550> then<00:01:51.550> add<00:01:51.790> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
say I want to do this big and then add a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.149 
say I want to do this big and then add a
couple<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.710> inches

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.620 

and<00:01:59.640> cut<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> off

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350 

next<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
next thing you do is you want to make a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:16.740 
next thing you do is you want to make a
loop<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> water

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.200 

this<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.970> skewer<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.090> to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
this is a skewer and I'm just going to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:46.100 
this is a skewer and I'm just going to
use<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.870> get<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.590> right<00:02:24.090> size

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.360 

just<00:02:46.860> twist<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> wire<00:02:47.910> around

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.320 

as<00:02:50.819> many<00:02:51.060> times<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.120> should

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
as many times as you can now it should

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.390 
as many times as you can now it should
look<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.780> little<00:02:58.319> loop<00:02:59.220> at

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
look like this and so the little loop at

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.339 
look like this and so the little loop at
the<00:02:59.430> end<00:03:00.110> what<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> need<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.349> do<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.860> simple

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
the end what you need to do a simple

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.809 
the end what you need to do a simple
read<00:03:04.349> luke<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:05.099> why<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:08.069> way<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.579> create

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
read luke is why this way you can create

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.339 
read luke is why this way you can create
your<00:03:09.829> noose<00:03:12.829> bend<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.980> wire<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
your noose bend the wire so that the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:26.250 
your noose bend the wire so that the
loop<00:03:17.040> sets<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.769> just

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.560 

looks<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.629> that

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.950 

now<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:35.780> piece<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> rope<00:03:37.140> cordage<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.960> you

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
now you piece of rope cordage and you

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.660 
now you piece of rope cordage and you
need<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> attach<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.890> end<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.460> wire

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
need to attach to the end of the wire

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.960 
need to attach to the end of the wire
here<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:50.000> i<00:03:51.000> found<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.460> easiest<00:03:53.460> way<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.640> do

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
here and i found the easiest way to do

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.200 
here and i found the easiest way to do
that<00:03:54.770> quite<00:03:55.770> simply<00:03:56.840> make<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> loop<00:03:59.060> this<00:04:00.060> one

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
that quite simply make a loop this one

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:11.880 
that quite simply make a loop this one
would<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.510> bigger<00:04:00.750> loop<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:02.070> manga

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.520 

and<00:04:12.400> this<00:04:12.880> loop<00:04:13.180> doesn't<00:04:13.750> need<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.140> be<00:04:14.260> much

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
and this loop doesn't need to be much

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.300 
and this loop doesn't need to be much
above<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.900> other<00:04:17.049> loop<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:19.410> yeah<00:04:20.410> because

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
above the other loop really yeah because

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.090 
above the other loop really yeah because
that's<00:04:21.730> where<00:04:22.030> we're<00:04:22.270> sitting

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
we've set that it gets pulls the trap

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.740 
we've set that it gets pulls the trap
tight<00:05:40.080> around<00:05:40.260> them<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:43.340> it's<00:05:44.340> difficult<00:05:45.030> not

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
tight around them and it's difficult not

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:56.350 
tight around them and it's difficult not
impossible<00:05:46.820> difficult<00:05:47.820> for<00:05:48.030> them<00:05:48.420> to<00:05:48.480> escape

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.779 

if<00:05:56.900> you<00:05:57.110> set<00:05:57.349> this<00:05:57.469> up<00:05:57.710> in<00:05:58.039> conjunction<00:05:58.639> with

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
if you set this up in conjunction with

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.020 
if you set this up in conjunction with
the<00:05:59.030> snare<00:05:59.240> trap<00:05:59.590> it<00:06:00.590> would<00:06:00.800> be<00:06:01.030> almost

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
the snare trap it would be almost

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.649 
the snare trap it would be almost
impossible<00:06:02.419> for<00:06:02.900> them<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:03.169> escape<00:06:03.469> as<00:06:04.659> they

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
impossible for them to escape as they

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.969 
impossible for them to escape as they
will<00:06:06.050> have<00:06:06.199> to<00:06:08.110> as<00:06:09.110> they're<00:06:09.439> being<00:06:09.590> suspended

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
will have to as they're being suspended

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.649 
will have to as they're being suspended
from<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.520> air<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:12.349> same<00:06:12.620> time<00:06:12.919> as<00:06:13.659> being

from the air the same time as being

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.080 
from the air the same time as being
caught<00:06:15.020> in<00:06:15.289> a<00:06:15.349> trap

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.060 

so<00:06:19.690> what<00:06:19.870> you<00:06:19.990> would<00:06:20.110> do<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.560> way<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:20.740> set

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
so what you would do the way you set

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.480 
so what you would do the way you set
this<00:06:21.190> up<00:06:24.030> just<00:06:25.030> by<00:06:25.570> itself<00:06:25.900> without<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:27.280> snare

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
this up just by itself without the snare

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.280 
this up just by itself without the snare
trap<00:06:27.729> let's<00:06:28.690> just<00:06:28.870> put<00:06:29.139> it<00:06:29.260> on<00:06:29.699> somewhere

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
trap let's just put it on somewhere

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.820 
trap let's just put it on somewhere
preferably<00:06:32.290> on<00:06:32.860> a<00:06:32.949> game<00:06:33.310> trail<00:06:34.320> you<00:06:35.320> can<00:06:35.350> find

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
preferably on a game trail you can find

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.430 
preferably on a game trail you can find
one<00:06:36.010> or<00:06:36.690> somewhere<00:06:37.690> where<00:06:37.870> there's<00:06:38.110> rabbit

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
one or somewhere where there's rabbit

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.030 
one or somewhere where there's rabbit
around<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.630> somewhere<00:06:40.630> that<00:06:42.570> will<00:06:43.650> limit<00:06:44.650> the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
around and somewhere that will limit the

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.240 
around and somewhere that will limit the
passage<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.850> animal<00:06:46.240> has<00:06:46.540> to<00:06:46.750> go<00:06:46.870> through<00:06:47.250> the

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
passage the animal has to go through the

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.450 
passage the animal has to go through the
notes<00:06:48.430> you<00:06:49.090> can<00:06:49.300> place<00:06:49.949> vegetation<00:06:50.949> around<00:06:51.070> it

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
notes you can place vegetation around it

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.540 
notes you can place vegetation around it
so<00:06:52.090> that<00:06:52.240> it<00:06:52.360> has<00:06:52.510> to<00:06:52.660> go<00:06:52.780> through<00:06:52.810> the<00:06:53.050> nose

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
so that it has to go through the nose

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.600 
so that it has to go through the nose
you<00:06:54.550> could<00:06:54.700> also<00:06:54.850> bait<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:56.050> trap<00:06:56.610> various

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
you could also bait the trap various

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.060 
you could also bait the trap various
things<00:06:57.880> you<00:06:58.000> can<00:06:58.120> do<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.620> then<00:06:59.620> you<00:06:59.650> tie<00:07:00.010> the

things you can do and then you tie the

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.240 
things you can do and then you tie the
rope<00:07:00.630> to<00:07:01.630> depending<00:07:02.500> on<00:07:02.500> how<00:07:02.710> you<00:07:02.770> sittin<00:07:03.100> up
