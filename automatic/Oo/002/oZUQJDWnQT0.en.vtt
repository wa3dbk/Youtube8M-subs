00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 channel every morning at 7 am I walk 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.160
 demand for uranium in the morning and committing 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.590
 walk and today I decided to take you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 a more accurate walk with you because 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.950
 that today is a very unusual day 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.520
 look around yes yes that's right 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.520
 it snowed though today is March 22 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.460
 completely unusual situation completely 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.239
 unusual weather phenomenon although probably 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 for other years it would be usual but 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 the day before yesterday I literally walked and without shape 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 I walked almost in such a light 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.250
 spring dress was plus 12 degrees 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 somewhere well, in short it was very warm very 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.620
 it's hot and now by the way now too 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 it's cold but in general it is not usually snow 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.149
 after such a warming, I certainly already 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.920
 I heard that cold comes to us and not 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.360
 nevertheless see the snow I did not expect and 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.610
 of course because of the snow I did not 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 cancel your morning walk 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 on the contrary, I was just overjoyed because 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 but always something unusual when you walk 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 in the same place I walk always 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 in the same park unusual 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 once something appears it is very 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.380
 interesting and want to show a little 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.240
 the beauty of this place is very small 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.840
 but cute park just didn't notice 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.540
 flower bed and walked right along the flower bed which 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.610
 is in the middle of the track I am constantly 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.549
 I forget last time when I also fell 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.650
 snow, I also forgot about this flowerbed and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.650
 walked right through it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.080
 there is some kind of designation here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.240
 which I don't know yet but 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.480
 suggests that this is some kind of house 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.230
 because I saw bird feeders there 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 and pigeons for white pigeons flying there 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.640
 what else do I like in parks like 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.100
 these are various decorative items 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.209
 for example here there is such a bridge 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.970
 he is very cute this is a track now 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.920
 snow and all one big snowdrifts 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 seems to be generally this bridge 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.769
 apparently through some stream I was not in 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.970
 this summer park to write well I mean 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:46.030
 how long has water been running and so i dont 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.910
 I can say that this bridge but 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.890
 some space under the trickle here 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.239
 there can be noticed that there is some kind 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.080
 masonry there we come to the lake 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.880
 to work 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:05.140
 this is the Athos pond and here also 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.430
 decorative elements this lighting by 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:14.160
 around the park and around this lake is very 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.980
 beautiful lanterns and of course a bench 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:25.959
 small bench without backs and 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.620
 a little bigger bench with backs lake 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.620
 fenced in 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.400
 wooden such columns for sure 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.400
 in summer it looks very beautiful i'm straight 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.599
 waiting for the seasons to see 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.379
 how is it here in summer but apparently it is a dream 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.870
 this snow drift is a little bit all 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:53.260
 spoiled it already the very edge of the park 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.870
 and here it is surrounded by such a picturesque 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.870
 wall such here is a picturesque fence 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.849
 there is a lot of walking here 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.700
 dog lovers and I practically have all 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:11.579
 dogs I know them like my relatives 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.579
 Naturally very funny 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.690
 how nice 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.319
 and here is a lake from this country naturally 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.810
 from all sides of the house because the park 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.620
 located within the city park 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.979
 small 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.349
 its length is somewhere from the edge to 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.770
 edges a little over a kilometer and 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.159
 It seems to me that the sides of 500 meters 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.830
 be 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:47.389
 if one side after another can 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:53.990
 more in general when I am here in the morning 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:56.719
 I walk and if I count kilometers then 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.500
 show me that I go around the circle for 2 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.719
 kilometers 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.099
 but I do not reach the edge from edge to edge 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:06.069
 that is, I am walking along the lanes inside 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.340
 parka 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.289
 the lake has almost melted and here 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.659
 today's freezing again his 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:20.169
 froze even a little bit 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.169
 the water lurks where it has already thawed 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.190
 here is a playground 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.440
 Of course here are not very standard 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.870
 recreational exercise equipment 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.450
 entertaining some kind of climbing and the 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.640
 similar things but there he is away 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.730
 there is a completely full playground 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.940
 exercise machines that can be used and 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:06:00.020
 on weekdays and weekends there are many 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:03.700
 people who are doing that's my whole 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.700
 story to new meeting
