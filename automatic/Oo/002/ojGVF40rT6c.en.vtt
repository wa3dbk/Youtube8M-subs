to be dispersed over a large area in

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.350 
to be dispersed over a large area in
this<00:01:18.080> hard<00:01:18.320> outer<00:01:18.560> shell<00:01:18.710> does<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.180> takes

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
this hard outer shell does that it takes

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.260 
this hard outer shell does that it takes
the<00:01:20.540> load<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.930> moves<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.380> all<00:01:21.530> over<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.940> you

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the load and moves it all over so you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.360 
the load and moves it all over so you
don't<00:01:23.510> have<00:01:23.690> any<00:01:23.870> focused<00:01:24.500> hotspots<00:01:25.160> of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
don't have any focused hotspots of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.030 
don't have any focused hotspots of
energy<00:01:25.730> ok<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.050> is<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> very<00:01:27.560> protective
