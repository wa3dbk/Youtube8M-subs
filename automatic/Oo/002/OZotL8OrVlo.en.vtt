00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.150
 ok very well and there floats the stock in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.280
 the air is definitely still one 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.000
 Bit packed but that is now 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.000
 not too bad either 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.030
 ok 15 killstreak so it runs on everyone 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.030
 very good 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.759
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 another round-robed fashion and yes 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.230
 right now I'm playing that again 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.360
 something more often what is called something more often me 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.400
 play the theme actively if not 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 can play because I have currently 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.769
 a few klausuren on the neck and yes up 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.269
 in each case there were a few small ones 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.940
 Changes and you have now here 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.820
 to humiliate the other players one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.890
 Ax you can hit and the arrows 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.170
 explode directly from the bow 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.170
 therefore impacting how to do that here now 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.790
 can see carries explode explosions 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.129
 explode yes there really is 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.390
 explode ninja face okay so and now 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 I have to make an effort in any case 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 because I want to be here if possible 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.880
 of course a pretty high killstreak 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 I think that's what I think about 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 hottest this game with the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.280
 killstreaks ok54 killstreak engagement 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.799
 but the 5th is way too low at 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.229
 Most sun 20s or something at 20 am 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.630
 I already satisfied my highest 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.890
 So far 27 was my highest 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:36.250
 killstreak I always have to look around 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.250
 ok the hammer came here now 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 okay then we did that too 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 very close 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 that was damn close 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.590
 the trains were still behind the body 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.060
 get ok perfect then we have too 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.460
 already the telekom from where does that come 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.510
 Oh, you shit pretty much ok now 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 Elfer killstreak and you can do it 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.500
 write in the comments what euro 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.610
 highest killstreak was so i can do it 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 Show it again if you like 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.180
 absolutely wanted the killstreak of me 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.750
 Okay with the special stage command 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.140
 a little wait back there a bit 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.970
 type okay that's died 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.740
 the high killstreak to the ice one must 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.240
 of course a bit like 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.630
 kempen and now just as 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.480
 express is just like that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.280
 else just too fast dies 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.630
 people come from all sides and stuff 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.440
 you also know how to do it yourself 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.280
 So people are now actively playing 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.280
 know about 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:57.320
 ok no what was that great at night? 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.850
 no matter what, it can not be true 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.070
 Mist no matter in each case goes on and 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.010
 the hartz coop is still so blatant 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:15.150
 is totally annoying with the car so here 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.370
 the first of the stupid humble me up 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.370
 no case by colleague 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.600
 what was that the spin-off hey 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.460
 Of course, it is very nice again 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.450
 but we have 490 points that's why 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.340
 also something in it 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.640
 we can definitely do a lot 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.640
 tear 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.570
 so warn and the shit is that is 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.060
 Some people are really no hands 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.110
 So no and easily 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:09.970
 fine spray man everywhere that is 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:12.510
 is right so take it now 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.510
 also again 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.019
 Everyone wanted to humble us with the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.500
 nice ax, however, this was here 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.280
 not okay five killstreak is then too 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.470
 again in there 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.250
 that is very good 690 in any case 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.250
 points year goes 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.410
 we actually die people often 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.870
 not because I somehow 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.790
 only I can find but if you like 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.930
 For example, think of it all in one 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.430
 then I do that because then 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.350
 rather the danger exists that the me 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.580
 pinch and the risk I want 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.580
 honestly just can not go down 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:07.250
 okay that was very nice now, though 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.250
 it gives a bit eagerly 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.600
 ok very well and there hovers the axis 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.820
 in the air is definitely still 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.540
 a bit packed but that is now 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.540
 not too bad either 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.650
 ok 15 street so it goes in any case 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.380
 very well and I can definitely 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.130
 Now do not run in the ax because 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.690
 otherwise we will besiege someone because 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.000
 we are not one of the extremely runners then 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.680
 I die, I believe, and we want that 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.580
 not necessarily at its high 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.580
 killstreak 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.940
 I'm also relatively concentrated 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.800
 So do not be angry if I am now 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.800
 to hold back something with the comments 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.330
 that was damn close 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.650
 that was really something of scarce 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.190
 also already in the pants go 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.620
 can 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.349
 So now back up for a chance 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.690
 fast before it's too late and we 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.650
 have won 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.620
 in fact we won but that 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.270
 I think I was a 20's killstreak 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.280
 people that was already the round now 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.690
 rage fashion and if you liked it 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.020
 then of course I would be like always 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.630
 look forward to a positive review 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.949
 and in any case if you are more passionate 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.620
 Motors just seems to be in the comments 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.180
 behind it a rating that is happy 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.400
 I really always like I said 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.900
 always again 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.990
 and yes, whatever I wanted to say is 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.190
 if you want to have so brocken so 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.639
 round where I really really high 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.569
 means killstreaks do it then 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.400
 Leave a review too 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.080
 when I see you want that with me 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.430
 a rating then I will open it 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.710
 you can do it any way you can 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.000
 leave because I have not so now 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.880
 a lot of time that I have such a right 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.740
 can record a blatant round but yes there 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.599
 The next round will be so gailer 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.419
 be on it in any case excited and 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.530
 So, keep what the best reviews 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.789
 I think so now I have ten times 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.860
 but said jolo and then I would 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:12.270
 say that 's it and see you at 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.270
 Next time, look people
