00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 I have just over two years ago 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 the last time in one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.710
 TV magazine has been watching it ever since 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.380
 a lot has happened two summers are in the country 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 I went older wiser grew 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.530
 have read many books many films 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.150
 looked at many children 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 No, I do not do that before me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 that has not been confirmed britt 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.369
 The people were deposed 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 set there and everything gets more exciting 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 rtl is still working successfully 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.859
 the privatization of the celebrity concept 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 and always offers in the field 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.510
 More internships at zdf has with markus lanz 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 the first entertainment Android 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 used and works with it at the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.000
 automation of journalism and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.410
 prosieben preaches that democracy 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.719
 means that the winner at the end of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.160
 maybe most money gets short 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.070
 is it worthwhile to stop by again? 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.239
 in this strange parallel world 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 watch tv youtuber shortly to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 explanation television is where resourceful 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 editors gold to spin and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.039
 distribute millions in the mind 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 Watching TV is a bit like apple 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.579
 products the only one is still really 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 Finding the right ones are either minimalists 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 or totally unrealistic persons 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 one day I will become my own 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 provoke stoning 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.189
 So let's have a look 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.659
 I do it like I do 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.000
 spontaneously in a television magazine 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.369
 Letters are really spontaneous 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 first find something between the script 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 whole scripted reality who would I there 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 like to say something new but there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 you really have everything already 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 but maybe I could listen 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 this always put the makers of this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.259
 same tricks formats my respect 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 pronounce 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.950
 It's really clever 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 first you do the formats so that all 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.759
 were about the protagonists 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.680
 and if that is boring and that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.930
 somehow everybody does that one then 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.970
 Protagonists are so overdone that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.159
 all laugh at the people on the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 protagonists laugh unknowingly 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.130
 fact that these people are not 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 exist and because that for some 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 time is not enough, the whole 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 now so shitty and absurd 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.750
 and technically fundamentally implemented that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.549
 every spectator can do that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 He prefers to feel better 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.689
 by being allowed to play moral apostle 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.630
 scripted reality is not entertainment 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.969
 more scripted reality is psychotherapy 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 The crime scene wants to provoke 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.030
 discuss stimulating topics 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.619
 to inform society 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.850
 but instead of a million and a half 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.469
 Heavy production creates one thing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.590
 Fat woman eating pizza with chocolate 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.700
 I want to respect my cooking as I said 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.190
 Let's take a look 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.019
 for example , I would come to prosit 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.989
 designing a gameshow would be on 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 in any case, a game in it laugh guessing 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.849
 a sitcom is played silently and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.209
 the participants must guess when laughed 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.120
 becomes 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.860
 good that not so difficult now 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.910
 after all, we are all on time 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.370
 laugh trained 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.019
 I personally do not like it at all 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.569
 more if we do not clearly indicate 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.580
 will make me laugh 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.959
 the bachelor the petition against markus 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.819
 while at the same time the new one 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 graduation the bachelor has started one 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.660
 rtl has long been shown below 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.920
 radar derer still critical with 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.569
 TV 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.069
 I think we should all be afraid 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.640
 before this newly gained after in 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.870
 freedom 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.519
 there are not many differences anymore 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.019
 between the bachelor and the shopping queen 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.760
 It's all about it in both programs 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.290
 as many pieces as possible as soon as possible 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.819
 possible to see at the end the most beautiful 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.329
 to buy and admired by everyone too 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.549
 become 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.230
 fabian how do i talk about women i 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.849
 just transport the image of women 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
 that the broadcast of the stations the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.720
 editors even the participants 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.730
 give me I want am 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.280
 spectator i love self-determined 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.350
 as long as self-determination means 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.329
 that voluntarily in my house 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.739
 move in and take care of me 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.959
 while I fight like a Roman 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.030
 may stand next to imperator and that 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.280
 I can judge all my love 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.790
 gender role they liberated from 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.920
 Identity crises or 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.720
 self-discovery phase and in this new 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.700
 I can then win the time gained 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 For example, look at the biggest looser 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.090
 Stupid people are no more 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 funny now must serve and fat 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.790
 if we meet the fat ones 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.430
 We have to make fun of it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.410
 another minority for example 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.299
 intelligent tv viewer i see 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.889
 there is a series in front of me 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.120
 about a bunch of scientist funny 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.950
 Do not feel like this 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.049
 whole interpersonal communication 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.430
 sfars a series that conveys that 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.109
 all intelligent people social 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.120
 are incompetent and that it actually 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.359
 Not so bad to be stupid 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.910
 That would be the next big bang 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.560
 theoretically enough for me I believe that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.019
 only man still really me 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.099
 I am able to entertain myself 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.780
 you also see that then I have 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.639
 two more thematically fitting ones 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.419
 watch videos for you on the subject of television 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.079
 It's enough for me now as I said 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.440
 I give myself tv magazines now 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.440
 no more
