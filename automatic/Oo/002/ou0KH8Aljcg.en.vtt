00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.420 

but<00:01:15.570> mythic<00:01:15.930> also<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.710> they're<00:01:17.160> very

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but mythic also because they're very

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.140 
but mythic also because they're very
rare<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.470> it's<00:01:19.470> hard<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> find<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.340> they

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
rare and it's hard to find them they

their<00:01:23.490> numbers<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.970> been<00:01:24.000> dwindling<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> if

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
their numbers have been dwindling so if

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.030 
their numbers have been dwindling so if
you<00:01:27.300> in<00:01:27.420> fact<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.960> they're<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.470> enough<00:01:28.800> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you in fact that they're not enough to
