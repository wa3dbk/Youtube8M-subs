issue is gonna be you can't connect but
nothing<00:00:19.529> shows<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.820> let's<00:00:21.000> start<00:00:21.210> what

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
nothing shows up so let's start what

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.450 
nothing shows up so let's start what
they<00:00:21.390> can't<00:00:21.570> connect<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> server'

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
they can't connect to server'

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
they can't connect to server'
first<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> check<00:00:23.970> if<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:25.109> know

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
first we have to check if the you know

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.670 
first we have to check if the you know
if<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.650> mobile<00:00:26.420> function<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> activated<00:00:27.960> most

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
if the mobile function is activated most

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.060 
if the mobile function is activated most
people<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.070> -<00:00:29.189> port<00:00:29.429> forwarding<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:31.070> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
people do - port forwarding and then you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.380 
people do - port forwarding and then you
know<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.279> type<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.579> our<00:00:32.640> IP<00:00:32.820> address<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
know they type in our IP address on the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.440 
know they type in our IP address on the
phone<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.899> nothing<00:00:34.230> pops<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> let's<00:00:36.329> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
phone and nothing pops up so let's go

phone and nothing pops up so let's go
ahead<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.800> check<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.190> it's

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
ahead and do that to check if it's

the web server as when your startup's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
the web server as when your startup's
it<00:01:00.480> won't<00:01:00.719> start<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:01.350> thick<00:01:01.559> enable

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it won't start up so yeah thick enable

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.649 
it won't start up so yeah thick enable
that<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.979> once<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.790> activate<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that and once you know is activate just

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
that and once you know is activate just
go<00:01:06.750> ahead<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.049> try<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> works

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
go ahead and try and see if it works

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
go ahead and try and see if it works
another<00:01:08.880> thing<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> way

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
another thing that could get in a way

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
another thing that could get in a way
that<00:01:10.140> won't<00:01:10.650> let<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> connect<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that won't let you connect is if you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
that won't let you connect is if you
change<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.990> port<00:01:13.320> number<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> mainly

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
change your port number so if you mainly

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.649 
change your port number so if you mainly
changed<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.990> HTTP<00:01:16.890> port<00:01:17.130> number<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
changed your HTTP port number so if you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
changed your HTTP port number so if you
change<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.439> HTTP<00:01:20.310> port<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.390> by

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
change your HTTP port like it's by

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.280 
change your HTTP port like it's by
default<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.080> 80<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.740> changed<00:01:23.640> mine<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> 8080<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
default is 80 I changed mine to 8080 so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
default is 80 I changed mine to 8080 so
on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> app<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.250> ask<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.820> IP

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
on the app when they ask you for your IP

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.560 
on the app when they ask you for your IP
address<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:29.189> type<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.640> IP<00:01:29.820> address<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
address you type in your IP address and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
address you type in your IP address and
you<00:01:30.659> type<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> :<00:01:32.210> whatever<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> changed<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you type in : whatever you changed it to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830 
you type in : whatever you changed it to
so<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.259> example<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.729> app<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.600> I'm

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so for example if I'm on my app if I'm

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
so for example if I'm on my app if I'm
on<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.170> iPhone<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.650> something<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
on my iPhone or something like that and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340 
on my iPhone or something like that and
the<00:01:38.430> Geo<00:01:38.610> vision<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.150> passes<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> IP

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the Geo vision a passes me for the IP

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.020 
the Geo vision a passes me for the IP
address<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.640> type<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.479> IP<00:01:43.320> address

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
address I would type in my IP address

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
address I would type in my IP address
and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> type<00:01:46.649> me<00:01:46.829> colon

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and then I would have to type me colon

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
and then I would have to type me colon
8080<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:49.170> change<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.500> HTTP<00:01:50.340> port<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.420> left

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
8080 if I change my HTTP port if I left

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.490 
8080 if I change my HTTP port if I left
that<00:01:51.930> 80<00:01:52.259> there's<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:53.130> need<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
that 80 there's no need to do that and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
that 80 there's no need to do that and
