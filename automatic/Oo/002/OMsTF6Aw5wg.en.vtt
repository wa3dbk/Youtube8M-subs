this review is all about hot wheels and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
this review is all about hot wheels and
in<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.119> personal<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:43.110> YouTube<00:01:43.500> asked

me leo could you please go and have a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
me leo could you please go and have a
look<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> hot<00:01:46.290> wheel<00:01:46.439> set<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.490> bend

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
look at a hot wheel set and do your bend

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.300 
look at a hot wheel set and do your bend
on<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> chose<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.200> set<00:01:49.439> speed<00:01:49.799> circuit

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
on it so I chose this set speed circuit

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
on it so I chose this set speed circuit
because<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> looks<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.000> there's<00:01:51.329> loads<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
because it looks like there's loads of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
because it looks like there's loads of
action<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.649> had<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> also

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
action to be had here and what I also

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
action to be had here and what I also
found<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.229> loads<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.590> memories

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
found for me there was loads of memories

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
found for me there was loads of memories
because<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.759> certainly<00:01:56.970> played<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.420> toys

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
because I certainly played with toys

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.960 
because I certainly played with toys
like<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.679> was<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> kid<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.460> me

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
like this when I was a kid for me

like this when I was a kid for me
there's<00:02:00.179> been<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.509> 35<00:02:00.840> years<00:02:01.259> since<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.920> laid

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's been about 35 years since I laid

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550 
there's been about 35 years since I laid
my<00:02:02.220> hands<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.729> some<00:02:02.880> Hot<00:02:03.060> Wheels<00:02:03.270> toys<00:02:03.600> we'll

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
my hands on some Hot Wheels toys we'll

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.779 
my hands on some Hot Wheels toys we'll
also<00:02:04.679> have<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> look<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> Hot<00:02:05.310> Wheels<00:02:05.460> color

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
also have a look at the Hot Wheels color

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.819 
also have a look at the Hot Wheels color
shifter<00:02:06.210> cars<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> totally<00:02:07.799> new

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
shifter cars which have a totally new

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.609 
shifter cars which have a totally new
dimension<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.580> playing<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.450> cars<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
dimension to playing of little cars the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.590 
dimension to playing of little cars the
ability<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.039> change<00:02:11.370> color<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.910> very

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
ability to change color is very

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.170 
ability to change color is very
interesting<00:02:13.230> indeed<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.400> set<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.790> cost<00:02:15.000> me

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
interesting indeed this set that cost me

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.970 
interesting indeed this set that cost me
in<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> vicinity<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.870> 40<00:02:16.350> Australian<00:02:16.739> dollars

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
in the vicinity of 40 Australian dollars

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
in the vicinity of 40 Australian dollars
but<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.700> seen<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.030> an<00:02:18.269> online<00:02:18.630> us<00:02:18.930> websites

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
but I have seen it an online us websites

has on many toys around these days which

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.550 
has on many toys around these days which
required<00:02:44.940> these<00:02:45.209> sized<00:02:45.570> batteries

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
required these sized batteries

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.319 
required these sized batteries
I<00:02:46.590> found<00:02:47.250> assembling<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.760> set<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.120> quite

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
I found assembling this set was quite

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.110 
I found assembling this set was quite
easy<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:49.019> everything<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.859> labeled

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
easy to do as everything is labeled

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
easy to do as everything is labeled
alphabetically<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.989> once<00:02:52.170> built<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.859> a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
alphabetically and once built this is a

or 30 centimetres high at the highest
point<00:03:00.870> though<00:03:01.769> two<00:03:01.980> very<00:03:02.250> obvious<00:03:02.640> things

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
point though two very obvious things

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.809 
point though two very obvious things
about<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.390> toy<00:03:03.630> first<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.280> speed<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
about this toy first is the speed of the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.479 
about this toy first is the speed of the
cars<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.329> circuit<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.319> almost

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
cars in the circuit it's almost

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.190 
cars in the circuit it's almost
intoxicating<00:03:08.489> torch<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.120> cars<00:03:09.329> literally

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
intoxicating torch the cars literally

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.890 
intoxicating torch the cars literally
become<00:03:10.590> blurs<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.340> flashes<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.030> colour<00:03:12.389> and
