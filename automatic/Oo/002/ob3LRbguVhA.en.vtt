here's<00:00:00.539> lick<00:00:00.750> 13<00:00:07.309> here<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.340> lick<00:00:08.550> 13<00:00:09.000> we're

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
here's lick 13 here in lick 13 we're

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.780 
here's lick 13 here in lick 13 we're
playing<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> fairly<00:00:09.900> cliche<00:00:10.380> d<00:00:11.070> minor<00:00:11.400> blues

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
playing a fairly cliche d minor blues

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.730 
playing a fairly cliche d minor blues
lick<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.660> what's<00:00:12.840> neat<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
lick but what's neat about it is the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.919 
lick but what's neat about it is the
harmonic<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> nuances<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.360> he<00:00:15.719> throws

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
harmonic and the nuances that he throws

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.490 
harmonic and the nuances that he throws
into<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> create<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.930> artificial

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
into this you can create this artificial

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.089 
into this you can create this artificial
harmonic<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:23.400> using<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.880> edge<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.390> thumb

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
harmonic by using the edge of your thumb

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
harmonic by using the edge of your thumb
actually<00:00:26.099> touching<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.609> string<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.359> putting

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
actually touching the string by putting

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
actually touching the string by putting
the<00:00:27.869> pixel<00:00:28.289> close<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> edge<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> earth

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the pixel close to the edge of the earth

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.220 
the pixel close to the edge of the earth
um<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> skin<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:30.960> thumb

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
um that some of the skin from your thumb

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.350 
um that some of the skin from your thumb
touches<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.800> string<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> creates<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.120> high

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
touches the string and creates this high

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.549 
touches the string and creates this high
squeal<00:00:38.239> then<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.360> end<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.629> lick<00:00:39.930> by<00:00:40.140> creating

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
squeal then we end this lick by creating

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
squeal then we end this lick by creating
a<00:00:40.620> double<00:00:40.950> stop<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> g<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> b<00:00:42.239> string<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a double stop on the g and b string and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.870 
a double stop on the g and b string and
bending<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> downward<00:00:43.829> direction

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.230 

hey

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
hey

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.200 
hey
and<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:51.320> last<00:00:51.620> bit<00:00:51.830> is<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:52.040> trill<00:00:52.430> which<00:00:52.940> we<00:00:53.060> do

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
and this last bit is a trill which we do

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.910 
and this last bit is a trill which we do
by<00:00:53.360> hammering<00:00:53.720> and<00:00:53.930> pulling<00:00:54.230> off<00:00:54.350> between<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
by hammering and pulling off between the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.560 
by hammering and pulling off between the
10th<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.370> 12th<00:00:55.400> fret

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.229 

and<00:01:00.010> now<00:01:01.010> let's<00:01:01.190> go<00:01:01.370> over<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.670> whole<00:01:01.820> lick<00:01:02.030> one

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
and now let's go over the whole lick one

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:12.440 
and now let's go over the whole lick one
time<00:01:02.540> slow

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.460 

it's<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.600> 14

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.800 

here<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> lick<00:01:22.740> 14<00:01:23.250> we're<00:01:23.820> playing<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.210> E<00:01:24.510> minor

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
here in lick 14 we're playing an E minor

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
here in lick 14 we're playing an E minor
blues<00:01:25.230> jam<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.980> playing<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.370> g-major<00:01:26.790> tonality

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
blues jam but playing a g-major tonality

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.200 
blues jam but playing a g-major tonality
on<00:01:27.840> top<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.620> by<00:01:28.890> use<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.190> octaves<00:01:29.940> which

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on top of that by use of octaves which

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.010 
on top of that by use of octaves which
were<00:01:30.360> sliding<00:01:30.690> around<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.260> string

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.660 

after<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.500> resolve<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.070> lick<00:01:40.250> by

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
after this we resolve the lick by

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.570 
after this we resolve the lick by
bending<00:01:40.940> on<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.270> 16th<00:01:41.720> fret<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.140> g<00:01:42.200> string

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.950 

now<00:01:48.580> let's<00:01:48.760> try<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:48.970> whole<00:01:49.210> egg<00:01:49.390> one<00:01:49.720> time

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
now let's try the whole egg one time

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
now let's try the whole egg one time
slow

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.200 

you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:20.789 

here's<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.480> 15

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.470 

here<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:21.890> like<00:02:22.010> 15<00:02:22.519> we're<00:02:22.700> playing<00:02:22.939> basically

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
here in like 15 we're playing basically

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750 
here in like 15 we're playing basically
in<00:02:23.569> an<00:02:23.659> e-minor<00:02:24.139> jam<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:25.099> we're<00:02:25.219> trading<00:02:25.519> off

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
in an e-minor jam but we're trading off

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.879 
in an e-minor jam but we're trading off
major<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.359> minor<00:02:26.540> tonality<00:02:27.019> zat<00:02:27.499> the<00:02:27.620> start

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:27.889 
major and minor tonality zat the start

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.949 
major and minor tonality zat the start
of<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.040> lick<00:02:28.249> with<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.909> major<00:02:29.209> six<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.840> the

point there we slide into that note on
the<00:02:39.739> B<00:02:39.920> string<00:02:39.980> 20th<00:02:40.939> threat<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.450> drop<00:02:41.840> it

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
the B string 20th threat and drop it

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.869 
the B string 20th threat and drop it
with<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> whammy<00:02:42.530> bar<00:02:45.189> then<00:02:46.189> we<00:02:46.459> continue

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
with the whammy bar then we continue

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.840 
with the whammy bar then we continue
down<00:02:46.909> an<00:02:47.269> E<00:02:47.540> minor<00:02:47.719> blues<00:02:48.139> scale
