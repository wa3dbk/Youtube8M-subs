00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.320
 hello everyone I bring you a hack to 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.450
 leave the map yemen in mode 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.029
 multiplayer because well this is 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.740
 local game and good as you see is the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.000
 same -which he used in the zombies 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.550
 As you can see my name comes out there to the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.920
 right, that's something that is already 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.019
 in the hack and good as you see has as 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.150
 infinite ammunition has super jump 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.340
 super speed the objects and the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.020
 bodies in case there were people 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.630
 playing online 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.630
 I know how good it is to just say 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.240
 online but first of all tell you that 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.150
 this does not in principle not work 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.200
 online because let's say the servers 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.530
 of stars have a kind of 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.290
 as we say detector or some I do not know 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 how to explain it is worth not leaving 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.120
 let play with what you enter let's say 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 in zombies for example that happened to me 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.830
 you do not enter and in less than two minutes or 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.080
 be in less than two minutes and is not 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.479
 slow and you can not enter with that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.940
 account on servers at least 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 for a few days then it is not 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.570
 that you are in but you are expelled and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.160
 they do not let you play in a few days 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 because because in the update is 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.110
 modified and that's why it does not let us play 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 it's worth it so I say it so you do not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 you scare I know that this was violated but at 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.400
 beginning of the game when he left the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.250
 game 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.490
 this already saw something like that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.810
 but do not be scared because I put 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 the hand in the fire that this is not going 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 online does not go for it by the simple fact 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 that kick you off or whatever it which 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.780
 you enter at least are the zombies to the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.690
 that you enter and you just clicked 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 this did not prove that it also worked in 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.979
 multiplayer I put in local game 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.840
 to try some maps and good and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.940
 you will see some maps where I go 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 and such with the super jump is clear this 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.509
 it's with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.490
 It has a super jump and a good part of the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.810
 mode album makes us pass the barrier 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.810
 of death and we do not die 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.940
 unlike modern warfare 3 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.680
 what it is when you leave the maps in the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.900
 black ops 2 is different I mean 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.060
 when out most pieces 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.740
 they are transparent although the bullet is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.320
 stay there as you can see the bullet stays in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.420
 this floor because it is solid 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.850
 but for example modern warfare 3 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.890
 when you shoot salt at the typical house 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.440
 that it was transparent the bullets did not 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.450
 they were let's say the bullet hole 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.340
 it did not stay on the wall but behind 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.200
 went through or if he threw a grenade what 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.600
 that was going through here not here not 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.580
 it goes through but still many many 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.180
 Sometimes the floor is transparent and over 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.350
 all the difference it has is that 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.080
 when you try to go around a map 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.230
 normally in modern warfare 3 in the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.540
 black ops 1 then these modern games 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.640
 warfare 2 2 the other four types at 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 surrounding the map you never fell under the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.590
 map were not always solid pieces to the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.670
 get away, yes, it could fall more 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.250
 down below the map 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.360
 but here in black ops 2 even if you're 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.790
 near 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.920
 let's say what the map is though 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.069
 the rolls are transparent pieces and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.750
 you usually fall not this map has chunks 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.130
 enough transparent pieces 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.080
 but it also has many solids like 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.209
 you can see here is worth this one of the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.580
 maps that you can go out more and 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.660
 that's good I just wanted to 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.489
 show it 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.110
 you will surely see some more maps by 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.630
 those that I go out and that with the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.980
 super jump is clear and little better 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.120
 so I hope you like the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.590
 video if you like to vote I like it 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.459
 favorites and see you the next video 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.459
 greetings to all 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.640
 now he gave me 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.180
 Y 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.180
 if not 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.170
 now star 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.100
 now it 's fine 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.530
 ah 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.540
 of Miami 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.450
 look at the wind with me 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.400
 let's continue 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.480
 water followed him 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.590
 for this purpose 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.140
 even so I 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.810
 as I said
