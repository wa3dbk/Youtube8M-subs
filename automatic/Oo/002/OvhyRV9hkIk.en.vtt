00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it's sad to say but the censorship just

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.070 
it's sad to say but the censorship just
ruined<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.710> anime<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.490> me<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.689> guys

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
know that I don't really care about

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
know that I don't really care about
censorship<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.750> much<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> Tokyo<00:00:25.740> boo<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
censorship that much like a Tokyo boo it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740 
censorship that much like a Tokyo boo it
was<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.210> still<00:00:27.359> tell<00:00:27.599> what

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
was there but you can still tell what

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.120 
was there but you can still tell what
was<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.619> wasn't<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
was going on and it wasn't really a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
was going on and it wasn't really a
problem<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.570> animes<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.320> no

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
problem and of animes there's no

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.160 
problem and of animes there's no
censorship<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.399> almost<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:33.059> animes<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
censorship and almost all animes that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.250 
censorship and almost all animes that
are<00:00:34.290> being<00:00:34.469> shown<00:00:34.739> weekly<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.390> mean<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
are being shown weekly but I mean the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.850 
are being shown weekly but I mean the
censorship<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.550> anime<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.930> ungodly

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
censorship in this anime is just ungodly

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
censorship in this anime is just ungodly
I<00:00:40.890> mean<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> point<00:00:42.090> where<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I mean to the point where it's just

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.930 
I mean to the point where it's just
black<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.469> three<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:43.860> four<00:00:43.890> seconds<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
black for like three or four seconds and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
black for like three or four seconds and
I<00:00:45.390> couldn't<00:00:45.690> honestly<00:00:45.960> couldn't<00:00:46.680> tell<00:00:46.739> what

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I couldn't honestly couldn't tell what

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
I couldn't honestly couldn't tell what
was<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.910> couldn't<00:00:48.360> tell<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.930> was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
was going on I couldn't tell what was

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
was going on I couldn't tell what was
happening<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> who<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.370> who<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.670> doing<00:00:50.850> what

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
happening to who or who was doing what

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
happening to who or who was doing what
and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> believe<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.469> episode<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:53.039> or

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and I believe it was an episode two or

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
and I believe it was an episode two or
three<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.910> were<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.090> three<00:00:54.420> bodies<00:00:54.840> there

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
three there were like three bodies there

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
three there were like three bodies there
were<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.410> three<00:00:55.680> black<00:00:56.190> circles<00:00:56.879> around

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
were just three black circles around

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
were just three black circles around
where<00:00:57.780> their<00:00:57.899> heads<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.129> i've

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
where their heads are so I'm like i've

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
where their heads are so I'm like i've
never<00:00:59.730> seen<00:00:59.879> censorship<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> level<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
never seen censorship of this level to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
never seen censorship of this level to
the<00:01:01.890> point<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> cannot<00:01:02.820> tell<00:01:03.210> what's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the point where you cannot tell what's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
the point where you cannot tell what's
happening<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> multiple<00:01:05.040> parts<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
happening in multiple parts so that just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.080 
happening in multiple parts so that just
ruined<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> immersion<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> me

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ruined the immersion of this show to me

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
ruined the immersion of this show to me
and<00:01:09.360> i<00:01:10.080> started<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> read<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> manga<00:01:11.070> no

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and i started to read the manga no

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.289 
and i started to read the manga no
because<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.750> did<00:01:12.960> dig<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.950> art<00:01:14.880> design

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
because I really did dig the art design

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
because I really did dig the art design
I<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> plot<00:01:16.500> you'll<00:01:17.009> seem<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
I like the plot you'll seem very

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
I like the plot you'll seem very
interesting<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> give<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.170> on

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
interesting now they want to give up on

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
interesting now they want to give up on
the<00:01:19.439> series<00:01:19.770> entirely<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> switched<00:01:21.090> over

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the series entirely so I switched over

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
the series entirely so I switched over
to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> manga<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:22.680> i<00:01:22.710> decided<00:01:23.250> i'll<00:01:23.549> go

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to the manga and then i decided i'll go

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
to the manga and then i decided i'll go
back<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> watch<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> episodes<00:01:24.930> later<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
back to watch the episodes later on so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
back to watch the episodes later on so
at<00:01:26.340> least<00:01:26.460> i'll<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.700> what's<00:01:27.030> happening<00:01:27.360> then

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
at least i'll know what's happening then

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740 
at least i'll know what's happening then
but<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> nowhere<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.700> censorship<00:01:30.090> got

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
but out of nowhere the censorship got

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
but out of nowhere the censorship got
canceled<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.680> guess<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.159> many<00:01:32.369> people<00:01:32.640> complain

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
canceled I guess so many people complain

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
canceled I guess so many people complain
because<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.259> problem<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.670> guys

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because it was a problem like you guys

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
because it was a problem like you guys
may<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.450> what's<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.470> if
