00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone, Alexey Celsius, welcome 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.919
 to another review mods 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.440
 the game farming simulator 15 and today we 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:22.109
 consider such a mod is a combine to of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:24.420
 cast well and as always we probably 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 let's start first with the appearance review 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.689
 I want to say right away that the combine comes with 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.000
 two different reapers 1 reaper goes for 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.820
 cereals and the second reaper goes for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 Corn in the description of the mod is written that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 it goes for both corn and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.710
 sunflower regret when I checked 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.170
 I do not have sunflower hull 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.789
 worked and maybe the mod is not completed yet 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.969
 will and it will be serviceable 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.680
 take a look at this side here with us 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.610
 the value k of the fire is written all 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 it is clear that we have something here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.980
 there is such an interesting thing about 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 wheels can go on here modders 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 a little modest and just one 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 texture crammed and they are black just 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 like coal, that is, you can't see any tread 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 wheels and nothing else in his bunker 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 combine and unfortunately not but he and not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.820
 needed because this combine is not quite 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 for harvesting these crops to pipes and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.229
 made in such a light with the powers 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 cool done there even somewhere he's on 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.049
 A pack there are such on a pack of type so as not to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.159
 bent well and let's sit inside and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.159
 look at it from the inside 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 inside ksk looks like this instrument 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 the panel and unfortunately does not work here have 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 we are such rusty levers 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 pedals already 4 pieces do not know two more 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 clutch maybe this is a brake on 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.210
 each wheel to the right and left and the windows in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 principle in the cockpit is very big and review 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.189
 quite good also has a window and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.229
 back and everything is perfectly visible and let's 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.350
 we finally get him to hear how 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350
 it works 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.509
 in principle here everything is fine with sound 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.819
 I especially liked it 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.040
 soundtrack while driving 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.500
 combine and when it works too 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.760
 interesting entertainment let's see 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.760
 how do we work lights 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.640
 here, as always, we will do everything 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.680
 also the backlight turns on and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.770
 the lights go off at the same time and behind 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 in front 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.990
 by close you beacon of course he 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.380
 present here but why not 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.400
 It works probably sweetie burned 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.250
 do we have a signal in general 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.140
 this combine 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.130
 where the signal is present can only 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.970
 standard about turn signals here they are 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.120
 absent 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.100
 well let's finally get to work 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.320
 let's see how our combine works what 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.330
 he can first let's push 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.310
 pipe it should automatically follow 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.350
 for the trailer with this case all right well 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.470
 and let's get the header on and try 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.350
 by work and we see that our culture 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.330
 easily turns into a chaff that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.780
 subsequent will just be able to transform and 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.500
 merged 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.830
 that is, this combine replaces us with more 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.080
 expensive version dripping on thunder how are we 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.080
 see here everything works everything is clear 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.160
 well let's also look at the second 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.020
 reaper option 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.560
 Here is such a great one 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.610
 terrible frying by the way we do not turn 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.350
 and up nor down 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.460
 well let's check how he 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.460
 works with corn 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.440
 see that here, too, everything is in order 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.060
 about physical changes in this mod i 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.070
 made no physical changes 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.740
 let's finally look at the combine in 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.150
 shop in the store our combine to 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.880
 art is in the section 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.420
 modifications of the cleaning category 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.120
 cars 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.020
 its cost is 175 thousand euros 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.940
 service day 385 euro price per 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 combine and service per day 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.850
 set by me for more comfortable 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.820
 games also with a combine goes and 2 reapers 1 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.370
 for cereals 2 for corn and 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.140
 sunflower their value I have not changed and 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.940
 service also remained on its 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.110
