 hi with you from lugo roberto cerdá my most cordial welcome to this new 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.799
 update of the video marketing blog olimpo un toco 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.959
 and this time I'm going to talk about it and the new concepts of 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:14.790
 advertising 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.109
 how to get the attention of your prospects 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.079
 i in throwing them ccoo using percent 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.900
 using campaigns 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 police campaigns although it is not as recognized as you well know in the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.370
 advertising percent to the use in which you're used to others bought to 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.890
 watch 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.309
 on television the typical exponent of December 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.530
 They cost us a product where they sell us brands of 13 pear good for that in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.830
 Internet does not work if it works on and when 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.150
 we watched television we had nothing else to do except patents min 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.670
 but face does not work because basically if we all go that ad 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.260
 yesterday of the network it is very easy for the user to realize that it is a boutique 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.590
 they try to sell something automatically for the millet and it's going to 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.980
 others 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.570
 percent agencies and republic companies and have had to reinvent themselves and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.329
 improve your creativity 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.110
 to develop campaigns that allow 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.150
 in gamarra attention first and after hooking the prospect so that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.990
 listen west long enough in dialogue with 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.800
 a detail a sufficient time exposed to the messages placed on the exposed product 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.600
 the brand 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 to get that reminder 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.969
 the key here 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.159
 i the tools to use to do this advertising are the day 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 and I catch vidal and interactivity according 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.780
 the video 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.080
 takes prominence and interactivity took much more prominence in this 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.620
 hour two points 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.450
 make a very good red 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.619
 I read in the blog of sea cuts in mind interactivity together with min percent in 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.179
 jaén el in the post that he had written and writer told us about a campaign 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.740
 here puppets are made in 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 Internet using viral video and interactivity and I have not resisted the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.819
 fifth the temptation to record this video to show from Santander 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.999
 how this campaign works let's see what we are going to see with direct efe 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.010
 contrasts sent about experiences I set out to look for the subject seem to make a 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.959
 collection of videos 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.639

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.090
 the first century of our era 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.849
 leaders of the chamber that there are delays in the tent
