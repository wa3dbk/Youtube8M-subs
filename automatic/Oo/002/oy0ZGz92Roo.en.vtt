questions about videogames and autism so

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.910 
questions about videogames and autism so
I'm<00:00:08.160> gonna<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.550> my<00:00:08.580> producer<00:00:09.000> Noah<00:00:09.900> ask<00:00:10.620> me

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I'm gonna have my producer Noah ask me

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.620 
I'm gonna have my producer Noah ask me
these<00:00:11.070> questions<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.759> can<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.120> shoot

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
these questions and I can just shoot

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:23.179 
these questions and I can just shoot
from<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> hip<00:00:20.630> my<00:00:21.630> observation<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.890> kids

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
from the hip my observation is that kids

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
from the hip my observation is that kids
with<00:00:23.369> autism<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:24.980> especially<00:00:26.660> receptive<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
with autism are especially receptive to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.529 
with autism are especially receptive to
a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> input<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
a lot of input and so it's actually a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.770 
a lot of input and so it's actually a
sensory<00:00:31.080> overload<00:00:31.109> issue<00:00:32.030> these<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.210> highly

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sensory overload issue these are highly

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
sensory overload issue these are highly
intelligent<00:00:34.110> individuals<00:00:35.040> who<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.579> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
intelligent individuals who just are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
intelligent individuals who just are
getting<00:00:36.149> more<00:00:36.630> input<00:00:37.170> than<00:00:37.200> usual<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
getting more input than usual and you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.840 
getting more input than usual and you
would<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.340> why<00:00:38.460> would<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> be

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
would think well why would you be

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.940 
would think well why would you be
attracted<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> video<00:00:39.719> game<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.170> think

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
attracted to a video game I think

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
attracted to a video game I think
somehow<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.090> hyper<00:00:42.360> focus<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
somehow when they can hyper focus on a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.529 
somehow when they can hyper focus on a
screen<00:00:43.789> even<00:00:44.789> though<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.960> busy<00:00:46.739> it's

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
screen even though it's busy it's

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
screen even though it's busy it's
limited<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.170> shuts<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> other

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
limited and it shuts out all the other

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
limited and it shuts out all the other
noise<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.870> find

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
noise for them and I think they find

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
noise for them and I think they find
that<00:00:52.350> somewhat<00:00:52.860> comforting<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.910> even

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that somewhat comforting or even

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:06.410 
that somewhat comforting or even
relaxing<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> social<00:01:05.369> connectedness<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.299> our

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
relaxing so social connectedness for our

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.469 
relaxing so social connectedness for our
autism<00:01:06.960> spectrum<00:01:07.229> kids<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.090> Asperger<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> term

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
autism spectrum kids and Asperger a term

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.870 
autism spectrum kids and Asperger a term
that<00:01:09.510> supposedly<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.619> away<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.070> that's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that supposedly is going away but that's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.260 
that supposedly is going away but that's
a<00:01:12.090> real<00:01:12.270> challenge<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.900> these<00:01:12.990> kids<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> so

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
a real challenge for these kids and so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
a real challenge for these kids and so
do<00:01:15.270> video<00:01:15.600> games<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.229> help<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.710> hurt<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
do video games really help or hurt I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.600 
do video games really help or hurt I
think<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.150> depends<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.340> are

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
think it depends I think if you are

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
think it depends I think if you are
highly<00:01:21.119> intelligent<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:23.090> fairly<00:01:24.090> high

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
highly intelligent and fairly high

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.950 
highly intelligent and fairly high
functioning<00:01:25.100> then<00:01:26.100> video<00:01:26.580> games<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.720> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
functioning then video games can be just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.530 
functioning then video games can be just
end<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.200> being<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.500> escape<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.729> therefore

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
end up being an escape and you therefore

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
end up being an escape and you therefore
you<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.170> I've<00:01:31.259> seen<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:31.890> kids

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you just and I've seen this where kids

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
you just and I've seen this where kids
all<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.390> online<00:01:33.650> beyond

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
all they want to do is be online beyond

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
all they want to do is be online beyond
the<00:01:34.740> video<00:01:34.979> game<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.540> interact

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the video game and not have to interact

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
the video game and not have to interact
with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.400> world<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> mean

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
with the world if you know what I mean

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.770 
with the world if you know what I mean
and<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.630> super<00:01:42.630> super

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and so if they're not super super

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
and so if they're not super super
anxious<00:01:43.110> super<00:01:43.590> severe<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.250> should<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.520> able

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
anxious super severe we should be able

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
anxious super severe we should be able
to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.880> rid<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> video<00:01:45.540> game<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> engage

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
to get rid of that video game and engage

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
to get rid of that video game and engage
with<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.090> those<00:01:48.210> kids<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
with them more so for those kids it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
with them more so for those kids it's
more<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.920> negative<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.090> seen<00:01:51.420> some

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
more of a negative but I have seen some

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.399 
more of a negative but I have seen some
of<00:01:51.659> our<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.140> severe<00:01:52.560> autistic<00:01:53.130> kids<00:01:53.430> who

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
of our most severe autistic kids who

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.560 
of our most severe autistic kids who
imagine<00:01:55.409> I'm<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.890> overstimulated<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.090> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
imagine I'm so overstimulated that just

now<00:01:59.700> is<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.250> anxiety<00:02:02.820> provoking<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
now is is is like so anxiety provoking I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
now is is is like so anxiety provoking I
can't<00:02:03.719> function<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> give<00:02:05.280> me<00:02:05.430> a

I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.830> depends<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> child<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.320> you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
I think it depends on the child and you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.290 
I think it depends on the child and you
the<00:02:22.500> parent<00:02:22.860> hopefully<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.580> being<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:23.970> tuned

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the parent hopefully are being in tuned

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.020 
the parent hopefully are being in tuned
to<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.770> helping<00:02:26.190> their<00:02:26.370> function<00:02:26.880> in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
to that is it helping their function in

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
to that is it helping their function in
terms<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.390> ultimately<00:02:27.870> interacting<00:02:28.410> more

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
terms of ultimately interacting more

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:43.490 
terms of ultimately interacting more
with<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.860> world<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:41.030> yes<00:02:42.030> oh<00:02:42.500> that's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
with the world or not yes oh that's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.760 
with the world or not yes oh that's
better<00:02:43.710> thank<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:46.050> think<00:02:46.650> if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
better thank you so much I think if

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.960 
better thank you so much I think if
you're<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> use<00:02:47.220> video<00:02:47.520> games<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
you're going to use video games as a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.190 
you're going to use video games as a
reward<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.720> should<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:50.270> small<00:02:51.270> doses<00:02:51.480> so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
reward it should be in small doses so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.950 
reward it should be in small doses so
that<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:54.150> extremely

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
that you know it it's extremely

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.980 
that you know it it's extremely
rewarding<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.650> kids<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> spectrum<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
rewarding for kids on the spectrum and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.390 
rewarding for kids on the spectrum and
they<00:02:57.990> can<00:02:58.140> get<00:02:58.260> lost<00:02:58.500> very<00:02:58.800> quickly<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
they can get lost very quickly so you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.130 
they can get lost very quickly so you
should<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.790> timer<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> clock<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.050> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
should have a timer or a clock and it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.660 
should have a timer or a clock and it
should<00:03:01.320> be<00:03:01.410> something<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.160> they're

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
should be something that that they're

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.280 
should be something that that they're
gonna<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.180> comfortable<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:03.840> having<00:03:04.050> an

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
gonna be comfortable with having an

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.810 
gonna be comfortable with having an
endpoint<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
endpoint because that can be the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.810 
endpoint because that can be the
challenge<00:03:06.240> but<00:03:06.780> absolutely<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.460> that's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
challenge but absolutely if if that's

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.170 
challenge but absolutely if if that's
their<00:03:09.180> biggest<00:03:09.480> reward<00:03:10.080> mechanism<00:03:11.180> probably

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
their biggest reward mechanism probably

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.670 
their biggest reward mechanism probably
the<00:03:12.360> most<00:03:12.570> rewarding<00:03:12.780> thing<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.200> them<00:03:13.470> in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the most rewarding thing for them in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.000 
the most rewarding thing for them in
life<00:03:14.010> why<00:03:14.850> would<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:15.480> attach<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.860> know

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
life why would you not attach you know

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.950 
life why would you not attach you know
we<00:03:17.460> need<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> work<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.090> homework<00:03:18.330> or<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.810> need

to do some reading or we need to do some
role-playing<00:03:21.300> or<00:03:21.900> whatever<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.980> that

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
role-playing or whatever it is that that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040 
role-playing or whatever it is that that
you<00:03:23.520> know<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:24.000> need<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.660> benefit

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
you know they need that will benefit

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.860 
you know they need that will benefit
them<00:03:25.260> attach<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> tangible<00:03:27.330> reward<00:03:27.690> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
them attach it to a tangible reward that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.050 
them attach it to a tangible reward that
that<00:03:28.140> really<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.590> rewarding<00:03:28.860> I'd<00:03:29.610> say<00:03:29.820> go<00:03:30.030> for

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that really is rewarding I'd say go for

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.600 
that really is rewarding I'd say go for
it<00:03:30.390> why<00:03:30.540> not<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:32.090> think<00:03:33.090> overall<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.220> best

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
it why not I think overall the best

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.800 
it why not I think overall the best
reward<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.510> children<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.640> our

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
reward for all children is our

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.450 
reward for all children is our
unconditional<00:03:39.810> love<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.920> let<00:03:41.160> me<00:03:41.250> tell
