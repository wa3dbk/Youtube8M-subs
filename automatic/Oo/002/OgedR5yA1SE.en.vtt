now<00:02:52.260> also<00:02:53.070> all<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.459> those<00:02:53.550> years<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.970> training

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.940 
now also all of those years of training
I<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:54.690> they've<00:02:54.780> taken<00:02:54.959> their<00:02:55.230> toll<00:02:55.500> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
I think they've taken their toll and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
I think they've taken their toll and
when<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.250> saw<00:02:56.459> him<00:02:56.580> against<00:02:56.880> Rios<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.600> Rios

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
when you saw him against Rios and Rios

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.590 
when you saw him against Rios and Rios
was<00:02:58.200> basically<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.800> walking<00:02:59.340> target<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.510> was

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
was basically a walking target there was

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.080 
was basically a walking target there was
no<00:03:00.720> spark<00:03:00.959> there<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.590> mean<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.070> an<00:03:02.459> easy<00:03:02.580> contest

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
no spark there I mean is an easy contest

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.729 
no spark there I mean is an easy contest
for<00:03:03.239> him<00:03:03.330> there<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.510> no<00:03:03.720> spa<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.260> he'll<00:03:04.590> need

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
for him there was no spa and he'll need

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.410 
for him there was no spa and he'll need

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
he's been around the block and you just

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
he's been around the block and you just
gotta<00:03:10.890> wonder<00:03:11.220> at<00:03:11.610> 35<00:03:12.180> years<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> age<00:03:12.810> at<00:03:13.110> what

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
gotta wonder at 35 years of age at what

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670 
gotta wonder at 35 years of age at what

point does he fall over the top and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680 
point does he fall over the top and
whether<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.549> training<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.060> taking<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.660> of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
whether the training is taking it out of
