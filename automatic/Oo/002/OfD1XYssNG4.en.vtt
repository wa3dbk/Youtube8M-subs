 Infinite struggle is the only thing that is the same as the old mode 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.620
 You can attack an enemy tank 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.300

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.980

 Try it first in Infinite competition

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 The battle is going on in 10-10. 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.160
 A team that gains more victory points wins the battle 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.240
 Victory points can be used to carry flags to base 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820
 You can defeat enemy tanks and acquire them 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 If a team earns all of their winning points before the time-out, the battle ends 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.820

 In an infinite battle, 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
 I implemented the functionality 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 It's called "garage battle." 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.900

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.140
 The regenerated tank is full of durability, and both shells and supplies are in full use 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.720

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.620
 Be careful not to get hurt for 5 seconds and do not leave the circle 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.720
 The same maintenance area can be used again after 1 minute of use

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.080
 You can also maintain it with your enemy tank 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 There is no limit to the number of trams because you only have to enter the maintenance area. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 Please expect an infinite fight mode 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.140

 The performance of several tanks is adjusted 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.860

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
 Conqueror Gun Carriage The aiming time and gun dispersion of the self-propelled gun increases 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.600

 Game client can be selected as HD or SD 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.500
 The HD version has higher texture quality, but larger capacity 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 So if you can not use the best-in-class graphics settings 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.840
 It is recommended that you select a smaller SD version 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.400
 Now, how to organize the platoon during battle 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.820

 Now everyone can gain more experience 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.080
 During the battle, 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.080
 As before, there are two or three sub-teams, but the organization is different 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.680
 Imagine that there were only two friends in battle 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 The enemy who is dominated by the numerals is approaching. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.520
 But now you can organize and collaborate with the Squad immediately 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.760
 Acting systematically through voice conversation 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 Try to defeat an enemy that has a large number of unstructured enemies 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.940
 Of course, you do not have to wait until such an urgent moment. 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.760
 You can organize your squad immediately with other players during battle 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 This means that they either walk together in one direction 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.040
 It is very useful when self-propelled guns and light-guns form a squadron 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.180
 You can organize the platoon when the countdown begins. 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.500
 You can click on a player's nickname to invite them to the platoon. 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.920
 The invited player can accept or decline the invitation 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.560
 Platoons will not be disbanded after the battle ends 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.100
 If you find a real gun, you can continue to play together. 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.560
 Now, let's look at the personal items. 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.160
 Basically, personal items are consumables. 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.680
 If you activate personal items, you can get general experience or free experience. 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.560
 You can acquire additional 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
 The personal material is a constant active effect that the clan is stockpiled in the fortress 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.920
 Very similar 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.180
 It is a material that individuals can use separately 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.380
 To acquire personal goods, you must complete a special mission in a random battle 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.800
 The expiration date shown on the personal 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.260
 Please make sure 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.500
 Personal items can be activated in the garage 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.940
 This is it for today. Good luck on the battlefield!
