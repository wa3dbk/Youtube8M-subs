00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
two joints have to select the spine but

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.180 
two joints have to select the spine but
not<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.519> leg<00:02:59.970> bone<00:03:00.300> if<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.350> select<00:03:01.560> neck<00:03:01.890> bone

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
not the leg bone if I select neck bone

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.229 
not the leg bone if I select neck bone
and<00:03:03.170> create<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.380> join<00:03:04.560> did<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:04.910> start<00:03:05.910> with<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and create a join did we start with the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.660 
and create a join did we start with the
from<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> end<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> neck<00:03:07.709> bone<00:03:07.980> which<00:03:08.489> is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
from the end of the neck bone which is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.830 
from the end of the neck bone which is
not<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:10.709> what<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.950> wanted<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.580> wanted<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
not that what I wanted I wanted so I

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.310 
not that what I wanted I wanted so I
have<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.410> click<00:03:14.220> from<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.239> spine<00:03:15.600> bone<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
have to click from the spine bone to the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.150 
have to click from the spine bone to the
shoulder<00:03:16.800> bone<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:18.329> will<00:03:18.690> create<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
shoulder bone so that it will create the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.000 
shoulder bone so that it will create the
connection<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.900> end<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> spine<00:03:22.709> bone

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
connection at the end of the spine bone

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.930 
connection at the end of the spine bone
that's<00:03:23.820> my<00:03:24.000> clavicle<00:03:24.480> position<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:27.140> press<00:03:28.140> f3

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
that's my clavicle position and press f3

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.580 
that's my clavicle position and press f3
so<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.360> see<00:03:30.600> your<00:03:30.840> position<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.440> your

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
so you can see your position of your

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.390 
so you can see your position of your
character<00:03:32.040> bones<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.450> character<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
character bones of the character and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.479 
character bones of the character and
it's<00:03:35.400> perfect<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:37.019> next<00:03:37.650> chapter<00:03:38.070> we<00:03:38.160> will<00:03:38.190> see

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it's perfect so next chapter we will see

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.319 
it's perfect so next chapter we will see
how<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:39.019> measure<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.549> joints<00:03:41.549> on<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
how we can measure the joints on the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.479 
how we can measure the joints on the
right<00:03:42.690> side<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:44.120> also<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:46.010> creation<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
right side and also the creation of the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.019 
right side and also the creation of the
leg<00:03:48.420> bones<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:50.610> thank<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.660> very<00:03:51.690> much
