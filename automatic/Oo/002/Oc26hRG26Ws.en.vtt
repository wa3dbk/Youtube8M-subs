your needs change you can upgrade the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320 
your needs change you can upgrade the
system<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.590> any<00:02:31.650> time<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.130> modular<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.120> down

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
system at any time it's modular so down

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.940 
system at any time it's modular so down

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to add one of these readers we can do so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.290 
to add one of these readers we can do so
this<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.350> permanent<00:02:37.650> fix<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:39.150> other
