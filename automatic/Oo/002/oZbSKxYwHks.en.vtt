ice cubes that's good and then i'm

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.790 
ice cubes that's good and then i'm
actually<00:02:07.119> going<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.570> use<00:02:07.600> half<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.470> candy

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800

actually going to use half of the candy
cane<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.850> cuz<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.119> fun<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.509> throw<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:10.899> there

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
cane just cuz it's fun to throw in there

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.420 
cane just cuz it's fun to throw in there
things<00:02:11.680> are<00:02:11.830> about<00:02:11.920> 50<00:02:12.370> calories<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:14.709> one<00:02:14.980> is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
things are about 50 calories this one is

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.479 
things are about 50 calories this one is
actually<00:02:15.580> 40<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.230> twice<00:02:17.680> salaries<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
actually 40 so is that twice salaries to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.670 
actually 40 so is that twice salaries to
it<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.750> actually<00:02:19.900> really<00:02:20.260> low<00:02:20.530> in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it and this is actually really low in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.110 
it and this is actually really low in
calories<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.280> drink<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:24.120> it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
calories this drink as it is so it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.690 
calories this drink as it is so it's
okay<00:02:25.480> i<00:02:25.780> think<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.950> holidays<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.970 
okay i think it's the holidays and
everyone<00:02:28.110> deserves<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.320> can<00:02:29.470> totally<00:02:29.830> get

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
everyone deserves it you can totally get

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.490 
everyone deserves it you can totally get
out<00:02:30.070> fighting<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:31.330> i'm<00:02:31.450> adding<00:02:31.600> AIT's<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
out fighting so now i'm adding AIT's a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.210 
out fighting so now i'm adding AIT's a
scoop<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.519> my<00:02:33.940> my<00:02:34.180> cellular<00:02:34.840> protein<00:02:35.440> which

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
scoop of my my cellular protein which

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.620 
scoop of my my cellular protein which
this<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> protein<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.239> actually

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
this is the protein that they actually

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.040 
this is the protein that they actually
normally<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:38.049> at<00:02:38.200> night

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
normally have at night

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.050 
normally have at night
movie<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:39.740> this<00:02:39.890> protein<00:02:40.340> shake<00:02:40.550> its<00:02:40.730> good<00:02:40.940> at

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
movie or this protein shake its good at

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.720 
movie or this protein shake its good at
night<00:02:41.240> because<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.920> slow<00:02:43.370> release

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
night because this is slow release

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.090 
night because this is slow release
protein<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.320> have<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> before<00:02:45.860> bed

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
protein so if you have a before bed

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.550 
protein so if you have a before bed
it'll<00:02:46.850> keep<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.210> muscles<00:02:47.420> from<00:02:47.870> feeding<00:02:48.230> off

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
it'll keep your muscles from feeding off

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.750 
it'll keep your muscles from feeding off
of<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.930> energy<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.320> it'll<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.010> instead

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
of your energy and it'll have it instead

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.030 
of your energy and it'll have it instead
of<00:02:52.910> like<00:02:53.150> running<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:54.230> protein

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
of like running out of your protein

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.310 
of like running out of your protein
it'll<00:02:55.280> you'll<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.300> off<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.480> protein<00:02:57.110> instead

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
it'll you'll be off this protein instead

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.530 
it'll you'll be off this protein instead
of<00:02:57.470> your<00:02:57.560> muscles<00:02:58.000> driving<00:02:59.000> thing<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.330> can't

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
of your muscles driving thing I can't

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.780 
of your muscles driving thing I can't
explain<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.110> well<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.980> look<00:03:01.520> at<00:03:01.670> what

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
explain it as well so you look at what

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.520 
explain it as well so you look at what
my<00:03:01.850> cellar<00:03:02.300> with<00:03:02.540> protein<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.290> really

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
my cellar with protein is it's really

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.390 
my cellar with protein is it's really
good<00:03:03.800> for<00:03:03.950> at<00:03:04.070> night<00:03:05.080> which<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.230> great<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.770> when

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
good for at night which is great so when

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.460 
good for at night which is great so when
a<00:03:07.580> dime<00:03:07.880> is<00:03:08.150> chocolate<00:03:08.600> flavor<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.290> really

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
a dime is chocolate flavor is really

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.520

good<00:03:09.950> at<00:03:10.730> them<00:03:11.000> i'm<00:03:11.210> adding<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.720> tiny<00:03:12.110> bit<00:03:12.380> of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
good at them i'm adding a tiny bit of

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.250 
good at them i'm adding a tiny bit of
cocoa<00:03:12.950> powder<00:03:13.090> cocoa<00:03:14.090> pretty<00:03:14.840> strong<00:03:15.080> which
