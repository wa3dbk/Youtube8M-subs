00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.460
 I made for you are happy 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.019
 ah ah 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.019
 at 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.730
 at 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.430
 barber 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.590
 the festival came to me with this 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.630
 crazy idea to offer me 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.880
 do the plug what was a bit of a 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.930
 challenge for me because I spent 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.270
 a little behind the big names 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.980
 so the idea was it was 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.830
 around the instrument a little classic 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 of jazz the trumpet is actually the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.610
 process is a 3d scan process in 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.489
 done but that is altered dacca a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.739
 alliteration a bit digital on the on 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.600
 the scan of this object would be like 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.730
 scan something in common paper 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440
 in fact except that something in volume 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.489
 and then we can do whatever we want 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.699
 we can repaint it we can change it 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.830
 the material so the idea was de 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.840
 to make a visual that is pretty enough 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.400
 quite sober enough minimal like that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300
 but who is this complexity of teeth 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.300
 which reminded me a little bit of 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.200
 lake topology of mountains 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.170
 the environment etc 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.400
 it looks almost like a map 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.659
 topographic and and that's it and then it's 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 also a little a visual that reminds a 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.980
 little my world the cover of my album 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 visual cd that I love 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.370
 especially it's all these 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 visuals that have a connection between the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.050
 digital and organic 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.070
 I think it tells the story very well 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.530
 the state of music today in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.870
 particular of the close of the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 technology to montreux on captation 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.180
 on how to film the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.830
 the concerts about the work that is done 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.010
 to cats the former land with the archives 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.560
 the digitization of the festival archives 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.810
 I think I found that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.660
 interesting to pay tribute to at 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.120
 organic and digital ratio of 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.560
 festival in detail I like 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.380
 never take off the detail sometimes I like 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 I like to stay on something 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.710
 timeless in detail I say 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.760
 often to my producers that I do not like 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.069
 the music of turning the knob 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.180
 that is production for the 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.349
 production is often things 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.959
 that we forget over time and who 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.810
 finally are more very relevant 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.700
 with time so this year I think 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.560
 that I'm going to have surprises and that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.390
 and that the necessarily the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.860
 festival will live with another 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 identity that's normal it's also necessary that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 it evolves so these are the things 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.099
 things are moving forward we're going to see throwing 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.360
 that I find that the the bet of doing 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.730
 come farrell on stage it's a beautiful 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
 bet it's a bit frustrating not to 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.620
 not go on stage but but who knows 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.660
 who knows maybe that's what I 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.080
 will go on stage we will see super good 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.280
 bah top 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280
 thank you, thank you very much
