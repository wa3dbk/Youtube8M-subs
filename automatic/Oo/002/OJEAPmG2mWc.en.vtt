when<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.869> her<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.970> monster<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
when you get her as a a monster that you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.770 
when you get her as a a monster that you
can<00:01:21.299> call<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.880> when

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
can call so what you have to do is when

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
can call so what you have to do is when
it<00:01:24.900> gets<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> roses<00:01:25.650> turn<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.430> forecast<00:01:26.909> wall

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it gets to roses turn have forecast wall

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.050 
it gets to roses turn have forecast wall
on<00:01:28.159> Asura<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.840> pretty<00:01:31.140> much

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
on Asura and that will pretty much

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.710 
on Asura and that will pretty much
nullify<00:01:33.060> her<00:01:33.420> curing<00:01:34.259> abilities<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.189> herself

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
nullify her curing abilities to herself

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
nullify her curing abilities to herself
so<00:01:36.720> she'll<00:01:37.259> cast<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.799> constantly<00:01:38.549> it'll

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
so she'll cast it constantly it'll

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
so she'll cast it constantly it'll
bounce<00:01:39.090> off<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.540> her<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> land<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
bounce off for her and land on one of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.639 
bounce off for her and land on one of
your<00:01:40.590> characters<00:01:40.799> healing<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
your characters healing them so this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.690 
your characters healing them so this
battle<00:01:44.070> takes<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.430> while<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:45.270> much<00:01:45.479> because

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
battle takes a while pretty much because

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.889 
battle takes a while pretty much because
you<00:01:47.700> start<00:01:47.939> attacking<00:01:48.210> her<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:48.600> everybody's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
full she hits you back she has hard wait

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
full she hits you back she has hard wait

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
obviously don't cast any spells with

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.160 
obviously don't cast any spells with
rydia<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:41.090> her<00:02:41.270> because<00:02:41.450> it'll<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.020> bounce

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
rydia on her because it'll just bounce

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.680 
rydia on her because it'll just bounce

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
back because of the wall so you'll just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.140 
back because of the wall so you'll just
have<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> do<00:02:45.050> all<00:02:45.080> physical<00:02:45.740> attacks<00:02:46.150> and
