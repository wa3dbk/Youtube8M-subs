00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
back in here again this lays upside down

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.590 
back in here again this lays upside down
into<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.439> die<00:01:30.420> come<00:01:31.420> back<00:01:31.630> here<00:01:32.490> set<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.729> come

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.140 
into the die come back here set it come
down<00:01:34.840> pop<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:36.040> bottoms<00:01:36.549> out

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
down pop it bottoms out

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
down pop it bottoms out
there's<00:01:37.840> your<00:01:38.140> washer<00:01:38.680> that's<00:01:39.100> rolled<00:01:39.579> over

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
there's your washer that's rolled over

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.980 
there's your washer that's rolled over
so<00:01:42.009> all<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> eyelets<00:01:43.329> have<00:01:43.540> different

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
so all of the eyelets have different

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.679 
so all of the eyelets have different
purposes<00:01:44.500> for<00:01:44.560> them<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.460> number<00:01:45.790> 63<00:01:46.540> is

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
purposes for them the number 63 is

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.899 
purposes for them the number 63 is
basically<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.229> standard<00:01:47.619> replacement<00:01:48.490> eyelet

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
basically a standard replacement eyelet

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.499 
basically a standard replacement eyelet
but<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:49.899> put<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.320> I'll<00:01:50.470> put<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.799> one<00:01:51.009> more

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
but I just put in I'll put in one more

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.590 
but I just put in I'll put in one more
so<00:01:52.509> it's<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.720> washer<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.700> goes<00:01:54.880> through<00:01:57.600> washer

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
so it's a washer it goes through washer

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.130 
so it's a washer it goes through washer
turns<00:01:58.899> upside<00:01:59.500> down<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.390> again<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.930> come

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
turns upside down and again you can come

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.560 
turns upside down and again you can come
right<00:02:02.170> down<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.799> skate<00:02:03.100> doing<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.729> setting

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
right down to skate doing it setting

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.520 
right down to skate doing it setting
them<00:02:04.750> pop<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.430> number<00:02:06.790> sixty-four<00:02:07.570> island

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
where I did a repair and the reason that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.940 
where I did a repair and the reason that
I<00:02:13.540> use<00:02:13.570> washers<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:16.170> anytime<00:02:17.170> an<00:02:17.320> eyelet<00:02:17.709> comes

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
I use washers is anytime an eyelet comes

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.120 
I use washers is anytime an eyelet comes
out<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.340> stretches<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.120> leather<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.380> washer

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
out it stretches that leather the washer

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.500 
out it stretches that leather the washer
here<00:02:21.810> helps<00:02:22.810> hold<00:02:23.109> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
here helps hold that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.110 
here helps hold that
barrel<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.959> eyelet<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.560> place<00:02:26.890> I'll<00:02:27.850> put

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
barrel of the eyelet in place I'll put

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.110 
barrel of the eyelet in place I'll put
another<00:02:28.240> washer<00:02:28.840> upside<00:02:29.620> down<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.310> use<00:02:31.090> a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
another washer upside down I use a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.930 
another washer upside down I use a
washer<00:02:31.870> over<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.740> barrel<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> eyelet<00:02:33.730> so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
washer over the barrel of the eyelet so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.170 
washer over the barrel of the eyelet so
as<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:35.310> leather<00:02:36.310> stretches

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
as the leather stretches

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.080 
as the leather stretches
I<00:02:37.390> put<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.959> washer<00:02:38.500> over<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.280> top<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I put the washer over the top of the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.620 
I put the washer over the top of the
barrel

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
barrel

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.559 
barrel
place<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.380> there<00:02:41.650> Center<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.330> when<00:02:43.540> I

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
place it in there Center it so when I

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.400 
place it in there Center it so when I
said<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
said it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.150 
said it
it<00:02:45.040> helps<00:02:45.730> close<00:02:46.060> up<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.660> hole<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:48.010> was

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
it helps close up that hole that was

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.059 
it helps close up that hole that was
made<00:02:48.400> by<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.030> table<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.470> it's<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.830> there

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
made by the table and it's in there
