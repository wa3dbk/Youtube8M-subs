hey there YouTube today we're going to

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey there YouTube today we're going to
be<00:00:02.760> taking<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> look<00:00:03.179> at<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.780> six<00:00:04.500> positions<00:00:05.009> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
be taking a look at the six positions of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.460 
be taking a look at the six positions of
the<00:00:05.250> harmonic<00:00:05.759> harmonic<00:00:06.330> minor<00:00:06.540> scales<00:00:07.080> so

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the harmonic harmonic minor scales so

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.930 
the harmonic harmonic minor scales so
I'm<00:00:07.890> gonna<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.160> showing<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> entire

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
I'm gonna be showing you the entire

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.570 
I'm gonna be showing you the entire
fretboard<00:00:09.630> scale<00:00:10.080> every<00:00:10.860> position<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.309> here

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
fretboard scale every position on here

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.270 
fretboard scale every position on here
with<00:00:11.790> tabs<00:00:12.230> somewhere<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.710> general<00:00:13.950> area

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
with tabs somewhere in this general area

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.200 
with tabs somewhere in this general area
and<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.310> gonna<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:17.789> talking

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and so I'm not gonna be really talking

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
and so I'm not gonna be really talking

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
only have one microphone I gotta set up

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
only have one microphone I gotta set up
next<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> my<00:00:19.890> amp<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> demo<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.330> listen<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.150 

you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270 

alright<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:28.460> it<00:02:28.610> guys<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.650> entire

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
alright that's it guys that's the entire

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.490 
alright that's it guys that's the entire
scale<00:02:31.700> well<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> mean<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.300> there's<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.050> up

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
scale well I mean this there's more up

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.990 
scale well I mean this there's more up
there<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:34.070> know<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.190> little<00:02:34.430> bit<00:02:34.520> past<00:02:34.730> like

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
there you know a little bit past like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.850 
there you know a little bit past like
the<00:02:35.150> 13th<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.930> 15th<00:02:36.020> whatever<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the 13th to the 15th whatever is the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.110 
the 13th to the 15th whatever is the
highest<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.370> scale<00:02:37.640> there's<00:02:37.820> some<00:02:37.970> more

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
highest and the scale there's some more

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.090 
highest and the scale there's some more
up<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:38.570> but<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:39.320> pretty<00:02:39.530> much<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> entire

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
up there but it's pretty much the entire

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.890 
up there but it's pretty much the entire
fretboard<00:02:40.610> with<00:02:40.730> most<00:02:40.940> modes<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
fretboard with most modes of it and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.380 
fretboard with most modes of it and
that's<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.320> harmonic<00:02:43.310> minor<00:02:43.610> scale<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:44.240> one

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that's the harmonic minor scale it's one

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.420 
that's the harmonic minor scale it's one
of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.660> most<00:02:44.930> metal<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.680> neoclassical

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
of the most metal and neoclassical

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.430 
of the most metal and neoclassical
scales<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.000> will<00:02:47.120> ever<00:02:47.300> find<00:02:47.690> anywhere

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
scales that you will ever find anywhere

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.820 
scales that you will ever find anywhere
