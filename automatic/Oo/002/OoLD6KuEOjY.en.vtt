00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 you think 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.260
 Y 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.529
 with which as they are welcome to 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.630
 Review of face 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.060
 fish and sub company paul and tron ​​us 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.489
 they bring this video game and maybe it's the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.110
 independent game with more hype created 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.570
 in history and after several 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.480
 delays when the game came out he had 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.879
 much to prove our protagonist is 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.540
 Gomez who lives happily in a world 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.339
 of 2d when by chance fate 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.290
 comes the one fez hat that gives you the 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.020
 to be able to appreciate the world in third 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.120
 dimension and suddenly a former aero 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.640
 explodes into a thousand pieces 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 instability to this world a problem 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.780
 which you must correct in company 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 of a hyper cube friend who's going to go 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.699
 with you advising you while together 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.520
 all these cubes before everything is 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.130
 lost the game may seem simple 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.380
 but the levels are not simply a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.000
 level with a bucket when collecting at 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.649
 end of each 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.619
 in fact at different levels there are 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.600
 several cubes that are in places 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.569
 insignificant which invites you to the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.550
 exploration you stop seeing it as levels 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.880
 and you focus more on the wells that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.190
 the game which are excellent the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 gameplay is simple you jump 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.270
 you interact with different objects 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.800
 you can load bombs and move blocks 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.090
 but the interesting thing is that you have the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 ability to change perspective 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.700
 let's say it's a game in 2d 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.450
 which is governed by laws of the third 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.800
 dimension you really never play in 3-d 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 simply the perspective opens you 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 new roads and you make yours by 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.300
 what do you take advantage of 3-d to cheat 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.060
 2 of the graphics make you totally 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.460
 honor to the old school the detail and the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.320
 impeccable art direction are the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.660
 color palette that manages the game is 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.730
 exquisite on some levels we go on the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.520
 day to night and it's not like a game 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.230
 modern 3-d that has a system of 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.410
 day and night where they manipulate the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.930
 lighting not here what changes is the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.840
 art direction and colors a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.270
 extremely exceptional work if there 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.520
 something that we could call art in 8 bits 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.730
 is 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.280
 the colors the whole animation takes you back 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.100
 the old days but not as a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.590
 tribute but as an evolution the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.660
 peace disaster music is excellent 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.850
 the atmosphere that is created is something that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.320
 few games achieve the soundtrack 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.320
 It's literally a must buy 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.010
 face is an excellent game that exceeds 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.470
 the expectations that one can have at 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.930
 watch a previous trailer or review not only 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.840
 captivates you thanks to its music design and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.550
 gameplay but it breaks the rules with 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.010
 the freedom that it contains and the power 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.170
 create your own rhythm in the video game and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.390
 go back and leave any scenario 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.760
 without you having completed it or leaving 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 wells for later and this simply 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.530
 because the game invites you to explore 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.140
 go further to find a door 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.570
 take it without thinking about what you leave behind 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.280
 also although we see that it has 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.560
 inspiration of many games of the old 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 school like zelda we do not see in itself a 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.730
 flag at the end of any episode and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.460
 they do not give us a score either when we pass 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.410
 to the next level the doors the cubes 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.350
 and the achievements are around every 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.500
 perspective as I said before then not 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.210
 it is a tribute but an evolution and not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.580
 I'm talking about the games of the old 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.950
 school nothing else is an evolution of the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 video games in general despite its 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.750
 freedom maybe it's still a game of 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.670
 platforms in 2d but in several 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.660
 senses makes you feel more free than 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.270
 some sandbox 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.240
 because freedom here is based on the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.760
 discovery and that feeling few 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.500
 games you can give it I've heard a 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.530
 complaint about that I have to 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.110
 mention the game does not offer without a 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 direct guide how to do things there 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.610
 wells that are difficult to decipher and 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.280
 in several cases you can not complete them 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.459
 at that particular moment and this 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.500
 uncertainty bothers some 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.299
 honestly I think it's great that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.430
 do not take you by the hand instead of 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.040
 complain about this they should see that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.920
 fest is closer to real life than what 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.440
 which seems which does not offer a manual 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.230
 in his time when he left for the xbox 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.930
 he had box problems but nowadays his 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.430
 PC version is impeccable and does not suffer 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.110
 no mishap 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.200
 If I could mention some defect 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.080
 could be two one is the map that is 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.870
 something confusing and two is that the game is 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.570
 very good that will leave you with much desire 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.730
 of more and the bad thing is that its sequel to 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.950
 it seems you will not see the light of day because 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.240
 feel fish no longer interested in being 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.300
 in the industry 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.610
 becouse is an achievement in 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.380
 staff when I played it reminded me of 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.750
 what am I so in love with 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.960
 videogames and you feel that it was created 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.449
 with the same purpose, this title 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.699
 can see and look like a simple game 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.160
 but the reality is that it is one of the 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:20.030
 better that you will get to play has to 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.440
 be in your collection duration 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.440
 Approximately 12 hours
