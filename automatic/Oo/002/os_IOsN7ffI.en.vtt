00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.990
 she is very nervous but being 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.810
 singing with the partner in the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.910
 scene with marley I feel much more 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.470
 in confidence she helps me a lot 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.600
 then what is my projection 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.060
 and the truth is that I feel a little bit more 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.100
 crazy more calm to know that I have 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.980
 have to sing one of her classmates who does not 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.900
 alone 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.900
 closes with a hard gold clasp 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 no movement pairs 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.809
 much better and I really do not feel that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.410
 everyone has their point to show off or 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.329
 be here nobody is sure we can all 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.760
 to leave the set is a truth I 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.309
 I feel that I have prepared a lot 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.390
 nothing delivered vidal my heart to this and 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.190
 the truth I want to stay in this 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.170
 program and I will do whatever 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 necessary to do it so that's it 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 anyone can leave but everything will look 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.040
 the day we are on stage 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.490
 i 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 i 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.380
 I discover that it is more 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.259
 near 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 mmm 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.950
 I 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.760
 yes 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 and forget 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.750
 I could not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.280
 in love change 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.280
 something different 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.090
 the woman 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.090
 I'll wait it's time to talk 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.659
 because girls 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.140
 this applause they deserve it applause is 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.750
 they deserve it because it 's a very song 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.520
 difficult I think the two are great 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.639
 singers and there were tuning problems 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.120
 from start to finish more marley tonight 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.820
 that vettel but with the two I really have 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.460
 really enjoyed it because they have some 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.680
 great voices I understand that they should 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.230
 stay in this competition and 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.790
 I would only advise them to work 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.650
 part of the tuning because so 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.490
 others I think we have in you two 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.689
 great singers 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.699
 but if I do not agree with you, 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.569
 there is one thing called singing and another 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.569
 thing called screaming 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.710
 I want you to watch the video of these when 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.750
 they were singing it was very nice but 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.850
 when they started screaming they tuned out 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.370
 kill yourself so for the next one by 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.990
 please control the tuning control 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.420
 your nerves and control your feeling 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.610
 on the stage they have very big voices and 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.610
 very nice but you have to control that 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.020
 my loves totally agree with my 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.370
 comrades know that I want them know 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.390
 that we had already talked about 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.280
 in the essay about this and I told him 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.300
 take advantage of the great voices that have 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.980
 and I need them thanks to the big 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.230
 voices that they have and the presence that 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.720
 they both have to take advantage of that and 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.540
 feel what they sing I told them to be the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.370
 Repeat several times the one who sings the most 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.920
 he is the one who raises the most 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.110
 we had a big detune with the 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.000
 rise of tone to my heart all the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.520
 beginning of the song flowed very cute 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.440
 I can not be with you and be 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.260
 mother hen cover what is not right 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.320
 I think they are great singers 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.340
 focus on what you feel so that 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.860
 can you make us feel ok? 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.530
 even so several of the public put on 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.530
 standing up so now and now and it's going
