00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.720
 I'm going to show you a very 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.399
 easy to access your files 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.830
 hard drive in case your system 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.990
 operative has failed or forgotten 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.450
 the password we will need three 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 things the first is a usb pendrive 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.930
 a giga 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.000
 the second is a linux operating system 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.440
 called ubuntu and the third is a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.170
 program to pass that system 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.669
 operative to pendrive the first thing that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 we have to do is access the page 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.530
 from www.youtube.com there we go to the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 download section 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.940
 ubuntu desktop 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.300
 and we started the download this is going to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.160
 delay depending on the speed of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 your internet connection 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 since it's downloaded below we're going to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
 the windows section and in the second 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.040
 point says that if we want to create a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 usb boot unit let's give it 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.170
 click there and here we find the second 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 program that we need we are going to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.580
 download here below come the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.230
 instructions how to use it 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.230
 since we have the two programs 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.730
 we're going to open the second one that we download that 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.050
 it is the installer 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.050
 let's accept what he asks us 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.730
 asks us to choose the version of 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 ubuntu that we are going to pass to the pendrive in 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.710
 this case is 12.04 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 and he's going to ask us to look for it in 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.990
 our team I have them in the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 desk 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.380
 since I have it located I selected it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.619
 hi selection 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 the pendrive that we are going to use and we give 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 and we mark the box so tender is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 very important that they do not have files 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.369
 there because it's going to erase all and you 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 let's click on the create the poster button 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.710
 or in rubber it takes 10 to 15 minutes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.119
 once you have finished expelled in the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.119
 memory and re-enter it 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 they go to your team and so and here you must 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.320
 appear and here we have mounted the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.320
 linux operating system on the pendrive 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.420
 we are going to use this same equipment to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.420
 do the test 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 I just wait for them to turn off 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.130
 we turn on the equipment and what we 're going to 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.590
 to do is access the bios 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.570
 is accessed as follows in the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.700
 first screenshot that shows us go 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.709
 to press efe 2 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.560
 and he must send us to life in the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.380
 Most equipment is this way 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.610
 let's go to the bots section 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.250
 here comes configuration bot and access 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.610
 to flip from an external device 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.680
 let's enable this box below 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.930
 says drip priority 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.660
 let's put first the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.150
 external device 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.150
 let's save the changes and restart 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.870
 in this way the computer is no longer going to 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.300
 start from the hard drive is going to start 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.960
 from the pendrive this process delays 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.960
 a few minutes 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 and ready to boot ubuntu from this 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.530
 usb we are going to give you enter 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.850
 and we are waiting for you 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.050
 i 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.120
 the process takes so long because it charges 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.520
 all the controllers from the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.520
 screen the monkey keyboard 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.050
 start as the desktop of 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.009
 any operational museum 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.559
 that's why it's so simple 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.159
 what we have to do is place 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.159
 Our course 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.200
 in the top bar and here you say go 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.340
 let's go to computer here is going to 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.850
 appear our team 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.030
 and the storage devices that 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.040
 we have connected the largest east of 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.289
 500 gigas is obviously the hard disk of 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.839
 our computer 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.430
 let's access it and simple and 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.089
 we simply look for the route of 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.089
 our archives 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.289
 documents and preferences our 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:32.580
 user and asset have been here is 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.009
 our desk that we had 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.280
 previously in the world and here they are 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:41.370
 the files that I had in windows 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.220
 what are the files that you download and two 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.240
 more than I had and it's a word and a pdf 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.830
 all we have to do is 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.800
 connect another storage unit 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.590
 another pendrive an external hard drive and 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.120
 drag them there and it's all like that we've already 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.400
 recovered our archives 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.110
 this team has a password is 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.840
 protected and as you will see I did not have any 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.120
 problem to access it and finally 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.600
 all we have to do is 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.689
 turn it off 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.569
 come on here it 's gears we turn it off 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:13.199
 we are safe and this and in this way 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.710
 we already recovered our files from 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:19.480
 our damaged type 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.480
 or that we have forgotten your password
