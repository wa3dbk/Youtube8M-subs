00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
preparedness mindset in many cases is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.260 
preparedness mindset in many cases is
that<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.720> want<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.700> universal<00:00:38.700> list<00:00:38.880> we<00:00:39.030> want<00:00:39.120> to

check off list that's the same for
everybody<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> especially<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.120> we're

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
everybody and especially when we're
