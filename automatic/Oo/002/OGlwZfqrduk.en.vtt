00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
to make this light up a little bit

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.220 
to make this light up a little bit
better<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:08.069> lot<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.700> times<00:00:08.940> if<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.780> video

better a lot of times if I do a video

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070 
better a lot of times if I do a video
late<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.860> afternoon<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.540> inside<00:00:12.900> my

late in the afternoon and it's inside my

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
late in the afternoon and it's inside my
garage<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.099> lighting<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:15.199> pretty<00:00:16.199> bad<00:00:16.520> so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
garage the lighting is pretty bad so

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.349 
garage the lighting is pretty bad so
anyway<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> light<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:20.359> what

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
anyway I got a light back there and what

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.000 
anyway I got a light back there and what
I<00:00:21.390> want<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> show<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.050> today<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I want to show you today I'm going to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.960 
I want to show you today I'm going to
try<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> remove<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.230> believe<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.400> servo

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
try and remove I believe it's a servo

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.769 
try and remove I believe it's a servo
that's<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.510> air<00:00:27.779> mix<00:00:28.529> servo<00:00:29.429> that's<00:00:30.269> making<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that's the air mix servo that's making a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.229 
that's the air mix servo that's making a
noise<00:00:30.990> I've<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.279> videos<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:33.000> on

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
noise I've got some other videos up on

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.680 
noise I've got some other videos up on
my<00:00:34.040> channel<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.820> already<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.630> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
my channel that that already show you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
my channel that that already show you
the<00:00:36.840> noise<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the noise so I'm not going to do the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
the noise so I'm not going to do the
noise<00:00:38.910> again<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.600> maybe<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.309> but<00:00:41.309> anyway

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
noise again well maybe I will but anyway

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.080 
noise again well maybe I will but anyway
first<00:00:41.790> thing<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> pull<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
first thing you do is pull the the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.840 
first thing you do is pull the the
glovebox<00:00:45.989> door<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.129> there's<00:00:47.840> two<00:00:48.840> little

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
glovebox door and there's two little

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
glovebox door and there's two little
little<00:00:50.850> rubber<00:00:51.120> bumpers<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.710> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
little rubber bumpers here that you can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
little rubber bumpers here that you can
just<00:00:53.070> bend<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> sides<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> door<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
just bend the sides of the door and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.670 
just bend the sides of the door and
it'll<00:00:55.590> it'll<00:00:55.829> fall<00:00:56.760> down<00:00:56.789> past<00:00:57.420> them<00:00:57.750> there's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it'll it'll fall down past them there's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
it'll it'll fall down past them there's
one<00:00:58.890> there<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.059> get<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.180> both<00:01:03.390> loose<00:01:03.690> at

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
one there and you get them both loose at

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
one there and you get them both loose at
the<00:01:03.870> same<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> hold<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the same time I'm going to hold that one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
the same time I'm going to hold that one
in<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> nicely<00:01:09.000> falls<00:01:09.450> out

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
in there and it kind of nicely falls out

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.940 
in there and it kind of nicely falls out
of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> way<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.960> might<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.500> even

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of the way and I think I might not even

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
of the way and I think I might not even
have<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> off<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> rest<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> way

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
have to take it off the rest of the way

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
have to take it off the rest of the way
I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:18.150> far<00:01:18.479> enough<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.990> really

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I think it's down far enough it's really

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.090 
I think it's down far enough it's really
pretty<00:01:19.560> nice<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:21.320> I'll<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.530> able<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pretty nice that I'll be able to just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.289 
pretty nice that I'll be able to just
work<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:23.909> here

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
work it from here

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.200 
work it from here
that's<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.759> several<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that's the several that I'm going to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
that's the several that I'm going to
take<00:01:27.479> out<00:01:27.689> let<00:01:28.229> me<00:01:28.380> move<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> light<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
take out let me move the light on a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.109 
take out let me move the light on a
little<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
little bit right there

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.319 
little bit right there
I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> air<00:01:31.680> mix<00:01:32.009> servo<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.820> hope

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I think that's the air mix servo I hope

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.410 
I think that's the air mix servo I hope
but<00:01:34.049> we'll<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.670> connection<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but we'll see the connection is that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.319 
but we'll see the connection is that
white<00:01:37.320> connection<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.119> white

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
white connection up there that white

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.069 
white connection up there that white
connector<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> I'll<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.630> off<00:01:42.780> camera

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
connector up there so I'll go off camera

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.929 
connector up there so I'll go off camera
now<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:44.009> figuring<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
now and do a little figuring out and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.050 
now and do a little figuring out and
then<00:01:45.119> I'll<00:01:45.299> come<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> white<00:01:47.700> connector

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
then I'll come back the white connector

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.149 
then I'll come back the white connector
is<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.689> easy<00:01:49.020> there's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.979> tab<00:01:51.079> I'm

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
is very easy there's a little tab I'm

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
is very easy there's a little tab I'm
just<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.490> shining<00:01:54.000> my<00:01:54.210> light<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
just kind of shining my light on the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.459 
just kind of shining my light on the
connector<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.770> little<00:01:56.100> tab<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.850> move

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
connector this little tab that you move

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
connector this little tab that you move
move<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> towards<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> wires<00:01:59.579> with<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> little

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
move it towards the wires with a little

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.999 
move it towards the wires with a little
screwdriver<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.590> pull<00:02:01.829> straight

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
screwdriver and then just pull straight

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.740 
screwdriver and then just pull straight
back<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.880> connector<00:02:03.270> will<00:02:03.420> come<00:02:03.600> out

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
back and that connector will come out

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
back and that connector will come out
that's<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:06.049> that's<00:02:07.049> off<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.860> pull

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
that's off that's off now just pull

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.110 
that's off that's off now just pull
straight<00:02:08.280> back<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.270> tab<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.730 

right<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> middle<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.040> that's<00:02:15.220> off

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
right there in the middle so that's off

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.980 
right there in the middle so that's off
okay<00:02:17.740> I'm<00:02:18.130> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.340> make<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.640> noise<00:02:18.990> happen

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
okay I'm going to make the noise happen

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.400 
okay I'm going to make the noise happen
one<00:02:20.170> time<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.070> can<00:02:21.370> hear<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.630> think

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
one time just so you can hear it I think

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.200 
one time just so you can hear it I think
it's<00:02:23.560> coming<00:02:23.770> from<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.130> right<00:02:24.310> here<00:02:24.640> this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
it's coming from this right here this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.260 
it's coming from this right here this
linkage<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> supposed<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.410> move<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:28.090> an

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
linkage is supposed to move there's an

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.710 
linkage is supposed to move there's an
arm<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.990> comes<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.620> servo<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:31.060> bunch

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
arm that comes out of the servo a bunch

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720 
arm that comes out of the servo a bunch
of<00:02:31.840> gears<00:02:32.110> inside<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.550> motor

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
of gears inside the and a little motor

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.880 
of gears inside the and a little motor
inside<00:02:34.150> there<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.230> arm<00:02:35.380> doesn't<00:02:35.680> even

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
inside there and the arm doesn't even

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.250 
inside there and the arm doesn't even
try<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.220> try<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> move<00:02:37.060> at<00:02:37.210> all<00:02:37.360> nothing<00:02:37.840> moves

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
try to try to move at all nothing moves

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.620 
try to try to move at all nothing moves
at<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:38.860> makes<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.310> buzzy<00:02:39.640> noise<00:02:39.820> here

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
at all it just makes a buzzy noise here

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:50.610 
at all it just makes a buzzy noise here
you<00:02:40.690> go<00:02:48.150> sorry<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.480> was<00:02:49.660> dumb<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.170> got<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
you go sorry that was dumb I got it

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.050 
you go sorry that was dumb I got it
unplug<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.580> going<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> make<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
unplug so it's not going to make the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:08.790 
unplug so it's not going to make the
noise<00:02:54.870> let<00:02:55.870> me<00:02:55.930> plug<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.380> okay<00:02:57.190> try<00:02:57.610> again

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.350 

whoa

whoa

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.430 
whoa
I<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:11.110> moved<00:03:11.410> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.690 

and<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.070> moving<00:03:18.460> just<00:03:18.490> fine<00:03:18.970> holy<00:03:19.420> cow<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
and it is moving just fine holy cow and

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.280 
and it is moving just fine holy cow and
it's<00:03:22.120> making<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.960> know<00:03:23.080> I'm<00:03:23.230> getting<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.650> noise

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it's making you know I'm getting a noise

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.950 
it's making you know I'm getting a noise
but<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.470> mode<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:28.360> know<00:03:28.540> from<00:03:30.360> windshield<00:03:31.360> to

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
but the mode you know from windshield to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.550 
but the mode you know from windshield to
floor<00:03:32.700> -<00:03:33.700> -<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:36.340> working<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:36.970> fine<00:03:37.560> so

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
floor - - that's working just fine so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.300 
floor - - that's working just fine so
it's<00:03:38.980> not<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.310> servo<00:03:40.410> son<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.650> B<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.980> right

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
it's not that servo son of a B all right

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.920 
it's not that servo son of a B all right
let<00:03:45.520> me<00:03:45.580> try<00:03:45.790> something<00:03:46.090> else

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.000 

I'm<00:03:49.930> gonna<00:03:50.430> make<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.610> noise<00:03:51.790> again<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:53.010> move

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
I'm gonna make the noise again and move

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:12.869 
I'm gonna make the noise again and move
one<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.580> controls

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.900 

now<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:13.909> don't<00:04:14.120> know<00:04:14.390> what<00:04:14.569> servo<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.759> son<00:04:16.759> of

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
now I don't know what servo it is son of

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.629 
now I don't know what servo it is son of
a<00:04:17.060> B<00:04:18.400> okay

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
a B okay

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.020 
a B okay
it's<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.720> servo<00:04:21.289> behind<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.430> one<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.669> thought

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
it's the servo behind the one I thought

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.190 
it's the servo behind the one I thought
it<00:04:23.240> was

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
it was

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.370 
it was
I<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.530> put<00:04:24.710> my<00:04:24.860> hand<00:04:25.130> on<00:04:25.370> it

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
I can put my hand on it

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.870 
I can put my hand on it
I<00:04:29.040> can<00:04:30.040> make<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.310> start<00:04:30.670> and<00:04:30.850> stop<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:32.170> just<00:04:32.880> by

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
I can make it start and stop it just by

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.790 
I can make it start and stop it just by
shoving<00:04:34.420> on<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.810> servo<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.910> don't<00:04:40.270> know<00:04:40.390> what

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
shoving on that servo I don't know what

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.710 
shoving on that servo I don't know what
controls

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
controls

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.420 
controls
but

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.159 

it's

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
it's

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.679 
it's
it's<00:04:48.789> definitely<00:04:49.789> that<00:04:49.999> one<00:04:50.180> at<00:04:50.300> what<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.479> am

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 
it's definitely that one at what I am

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.770 
it's definitely that one at what I am
plug<00:04:51.580> misty<00:04:52.580> Beckett<00:04:52.879> trace<00:04:53.120> where<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.389> plug

plug misty Beckett trace where that plug

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.190 
plug misty Beckett trace where that plug
goes<00:04:54.159> okay<00:04:55.159> going<00:04:55.460> from<00:04:55.879> left<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.419> right

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.900 

this<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.160> mode<00:05:00.490> servo<00:05:01.390> here<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:03.460> mine<00:05:03.760> is

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
this is the mode servo here and mine is

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.450 
this is the mode servo here and mine is
working<00:05:04.330> okay<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.750> can<00:05:05.200> cycle<00:05:05.440> through<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.980> mo

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
working okay I can cycle through the mo

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.749 
working okay I can cycle through the mo
little<00:05:06.880> white<00:05:07.030> arms<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.840> everything<00:05:08.759> that

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
little white arms and everything that

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.960 
little white arms and everything that
one<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.180> back<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.020> mode<00:05:11.259> is<00:05:12.069> the<00:05:12.610> one

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
one in back of the mode is the one

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.170 
one in back of the mode is the one
that's<00:05:13.150> buzzing<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:15.039> think<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:15.550> heat

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that's buzzing and I think it's heat

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.170 
that's buzzing and I think it's heat
maybe<00:05:17.340> that's<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.610> one<00:05:18.729> that<00:05:18.880> controls

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
maybe that's the one that controls

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.960 
maybe that's the one that controls
higher<00:05:19.690> heat<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.229> lower<00:05:20.410> heat<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:20.979> then

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
higher heat and lower heat and then

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.300 
higher heat and lower heat and then
there's<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.330> third<00:05:22.569> so<00:05:22.930> go<00:05:23.139> right<00:05:23.380> up<00:05:23.560> there<00:05:24.039> and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
there's a third so go right up there and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.070 
there's a third so go right up there and
that's<00:05:25.620> inside<00:05:26.620> air<00:05:27.419> circulating<00:05:28.419> or<00:05:28.630> fresh

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
that's inside air circulating or fresh

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.129 
that's inside air circulating or fresh
air<00:05:29.349> from<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.650> outside<00:05:30.210> now<00:05:31.210> that<00:05:31.750> one<00:05:31.930> also

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
air from the outside now that one also

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.620 
air from the outside now that one also
works<00:05:32.590> fine<00:05:32.979> when<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.310> move<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:33.880> controls<00:05:34.389> on

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
works fine when I move the controls on
