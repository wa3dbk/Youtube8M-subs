00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
somebody and and possibly you know get

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
knocked out which is something that we

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.820 
knocked out which is something that we
haven't<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:29.970> seen<00:03:30.270> anybody<00:03:30.600> give<00:03:31.560> him<00:03:31.740> a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
haven't really seen anybody give him a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.070 
haven't really seen anybody give him a
good<00:03:31.980> challenge<00:03:32.280> physically<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.180> first<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.960> all

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
good challenge physically I first of all

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.230 
good challenge physically I first of all
think<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.410> there's<00:03:35.340> more<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.730> come<00:03:35.790> i<00:03:36.000> mean

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
think that there's more to come i mean

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.790 
think that there's more to come i mean
there's<00:03:36.390> obviously<00:03:36.750> another<00:03:36.840> female<00:03:37.380> part<00:03:37.740> to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
there's obviously another female part to

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.190 
there's obviously another female part to
be<00:03:37.920> cast<00:03:38.160> i<00:03:38.340> think<00:03:38.520> that's<00:03:38.700> obviously<00:03:39.090> i<00:03:39.360> don't

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
be cast i think that's obviously i don't

be cast i think that's obviously i don't
say<00:03:40.440> obviously<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:40.980> i<00:03:41.010> think<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.430> great

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580

some<00:04:49.719> kind<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.050> redemption<00:04:50.680> after<00:04:51.189> that<00:04:51.490> but

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
some kind of redemption after that but

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.689 
some kind of redemption after that but
it's<00:04:51.999> it<00:04:52.330> seems<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.229> that's<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:54.430> kind<00:04:54.639> of
