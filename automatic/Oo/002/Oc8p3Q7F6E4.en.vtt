00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 I'll explain to you how the 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.090
 people do to make organic compost 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.309
 or rather how do you reduce a 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.279
 the litter that we produce in our 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.400
 house and produce a fertilizer of excellent 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 quality 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.800
 to control my face 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.340
 you stop the leaves that do not 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 they serve 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.890
 for those who live in smaller spaces 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.899
 apartments or even a house that does not 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 have a space to make a stack of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.480
 outdoor composting 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.699
 there is such an option is a 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.390
 home made minish in boxes 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.890
 then look how barbarians are three boxes 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.130
 the 1st and 2nd class boxes are drilled 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.020
 so that the worms can transit 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 freely and we begin by supplying the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.770
 middle chest 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.780
 My dear, he always starts with a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.050
 little earthworm humus and a group of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.509
 earthworms that may be 30 earthworms 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.110
 Californian red type then 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.420
 earthworm she is a garbage collector 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.250
 organic she is eating eating eating 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.840
 and turning all that junk 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.819
 from our kitchen in fertilizer in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.479
 earthworm humus then how does the 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.700
 people do to feed this minhocary 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.390
 we have our damp garbage that the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.360
 kitchen trash coffee grounds 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 leaves that are not suitable for the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.420
 our food stalks that we 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.959
 also will not enjoy has a rule 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.200
 which is the basic means for each part of 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.830
 wet waste from the kitchen I put I 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.569
 I have to put two pieces of trash 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.310
 dry dry organic garbage and so I go 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.209
 daily opening space in the minho 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.239
 and mixing the kitchen waste with the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.010
 garden litter and thus I get 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.709
 greatly reduce the production of waste from 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.330
 my house and other animals that are well 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.710
 legal process for our 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.840
 composting 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:46.900
 has the armadillo he is a devourer 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:50.300
 pean also sits on 50 days 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.120
 This garbage is going to reduce a lot, I do not 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.520
 I'll be able to identify what it is 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.480
 leaf what is bark and will become a 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.850
 pozinho that is the use of earthworm 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.750
 third box 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.200
 leftover leftover I can use for both 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.750
 water my garden while spraying 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.230
 there so busy with in a part of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.020
 ten parts of water and then the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.910
 spray on my plants and so I 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.630
 I can do a complete process of 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.630
 composting
