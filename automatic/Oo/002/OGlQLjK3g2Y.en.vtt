have<00:06:19.620> improved<00:06:20.070> anything<00:06:20.639> in<00:06:21.020> fact<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.320> might

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
have improved anything in fact I might

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.710 
have improved anything in fact I might
even<00:06:22.680> go<00:06:23.100> the<00:06:23.400> opposite<00:06:23.910> direction<00:06:24.060> I<00:06:24.570> would

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
even go the opposite direction I would

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.440 
even go the opposite direction I would
remove<00:06:25.440> two<00:06:26.130> of<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.400> action<00:06:26.850> scenes<00:06:27.150> from

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.219 
remove two of the action scenes from
this<00:06:27.630> book

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
this book

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.950 
this book
first<00:06:29.039> I'd<00:06:29.430> removed<00:06:29.880> a<00:06:30.000> crocodile<00:06:30.570> attack

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
first I'd removed a crocodile attack

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.500 
first I'd removed a crocodile attack
because<00:06:31.530> it<00:06:31.560> was<00:06:31.800> completely<00:06:32.280> out<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.580> place<00:06:32.940> I

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
because it was completely out of place I

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.440 
because it was completely out of place I
mean<00:06:34.289> a<00:06:34.320> crocodile<00:06:34.979> attack<00:06:35.340> in<00:06:35.580> Illinois

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
mean a crocodile attack in Illinois

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.540 
mean a crocodile attack in Illinois
having<00:06:37.169> the<00:06:37.289> van<00:06:37.470> get<00:06:37.710> smashed<00:06:38.039> was<00:06:38.340> good

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
having the van get smashed was good

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.040 
having the van get smashed was good
enough<00:06:38.789> for<00:06:38.849> a<00:06:39.060> dangerous<00:06:39.659> sea

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
enough for a dangerous sea

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.529 
enough for a dangerous sea
there<00:06:40.530> was<00:06:40.680> no<00:06:40.979> need<00:06:41.340> to<00:06:41.370> throw<00:06:41.849> crocodiles

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
there was no need to throw crocodiles

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.740 
there was no need to throw crocodiles
into<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.110> mix<00:06:43.909> second<00:06:44.909> I'd<00:06:45.150> get<00:06:45.360> rid<00:06:45.539> of<00:06:45.659> the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
into the mix second I'd get rid of the

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.839 
into the mix second I'd get rid of the

thought of that murder plot the crazy

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.779 
thought of that murder plot the crazy
part<00:06:55.259> is<00:06:55.319> that<00:06:55.379> Joyce<00:06:55.740> threatens<00:06:56.250> Nancy<00:06:56.639> with
