 scenario and citizen security 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.139
 in the year 2025 they will see around 250 million migrants of which 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 65% will be established in large cities 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.800
 shortage of food, limited access to water will generate tension between 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 people who covered the city 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.210
 the population Tuesday to consume a safer challenge to protect them from the world 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.599

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.720
 low caliber 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.490
 it will be sold as an option for automotive safety 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.820
 as india evacuated a neighboring system 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680
 the prices and production of these pieces must begin to think from the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 mass production 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.920
 with faster processes cheaper and cleaner materials 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 world stage 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.690
 it is the year 2025 the natural resources begin to scarce oil have been

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.800
 50% mineral resources are in the poorest countries and recycling 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.880
 it got very important the provenance recycled raw materials removed them

 your marlins injury consumption energy 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.410
 The reduction of mobility was achieved by the inclusion of weight with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.070
 pieces of light language that the use of plastics installed in vehicles a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.040
 30% smaller 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 aitex scenario 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.600
 In 2025 advances in robotics and high technology will allow the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.390
 vehicle is driven only by converting it into a space not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.290
 counted the necessary accommodations for the members 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.720
 vehicles on the surface more extensive shipments that were control to the

 Sunrays and temperature inside with a panoramic view 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 improved to enjoy the passage from one place to another 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.330
 from production new technologies will facilitate the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.910
 making more organic pieces with much more manageable materials and 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.260
 more fronts to contain the development in addition to high technology 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.920
 nanotechnology will offer innumerable improvements in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.330
 individualization of the pieces achieving personalized behavior 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.280
 of the viruses according to the climate the temperature 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.720

 city ​​insecurity scenario 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.670
 in 2020 competition for resources such as energy and water intensifies 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.630
 developing countries have the highest growth rates 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.749
 population in the level of unemployment and underemployment are worrying 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.919
 once again the vehicle becomes an element of protection that 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.369
 occupy the occupants of the laying outside world 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.039
 new technologies allow the development of unique pieces by 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:28.059
 vehicles that make them useless in another similar flight thus decreasing the 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:29.879
 steal for rent your feet 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.629
 the developments in the internal one billion allow to visibly hide what 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.639
 that inside 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.139
 when the driver can be 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.239
 increasing to levels of privacy and security 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.159
 dover scenario 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.090
 in the year 2020 continues the leaf were superior to being more vehicles 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.089
 Economics that work with alternative renewable energies 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.760
 the solar factor the protection to the interior against rays v and the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.069
 decreased use of the weak pulse air conditioning of the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.920

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.039
 they become a lot of them 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.070
 the technological advance productive processes and machinery 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.620
 allows to go through the civil separation process of the classic civil for its 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.569
 easy reuse or recycling 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.009
 also the obtaining of high quality wines 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.369
 obtained by the fleet process or will be achieved with another's baptized virus 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.829
 subject decreasing the use of natural resources aitex scenario 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.989
 in the year 2020, technological advances to those of the sentra vehicle 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.999
 entertainment for people 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.079
 vehicles will still be driven automatically but yes 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.349
 they will have support to diminish to the maximum the intervention of the human being 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.359
 the videos were an essential part of the passive safety of the car 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.639
 change color according to the occasion to diminish own in the day and in the 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.059
 night improve visibility 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.509
 advances in production technologies will allow the 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.459
 personalization of vehicles with interchangeable vines of shapes and 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.979
 colors according to the taste of each user 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:44.809
 stage 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:46.569
 and citizen security 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.559
 in 2015 the political differences between the countries that will make 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.779
 personal confrontations attacks in big cities 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.689
 the vehicles will be protected against long-range missiles and 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.379
 high power artifacts 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.359
 the designs because it is much more curved and envelope the processes will be displayed 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.549
 manufacturing extortions 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.639
 God's finger and materials 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.949
 the armor will remain exclusive for people of high income little 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.169
 political risk 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.389
 the low weight will be a requirement not to affect the performance of the pelt 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.139
 stage 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.449
 in 2015 plus the world the greenhouse effect 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.879
 the world continues to opt for new forms of energy and biofuels have 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.479
 great reception for means of transport 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.009
 of cars running on alternative energies and the world and more 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.729
 that the need never stop the greenhouse effect 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.580
 polluting materials are not well seen and borders between countries are 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.809
 open to find points of common agreement protecting the planet 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.759
 the production of security videos now has to follow some rules and 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.819
 international standards to reduce the ecological impact 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.939
 also the losers of raw materials take into account the studies 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.050
 bioclimatics for the development of new materials that satisfy 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.110
 new customers with a greener mindset 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900
 cadet stage 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.080
 It's 2015 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.849
 security videos are an essential part for the protection of many 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:01.939
 citizens 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.549
 now the viruses are bigger but less heavy the technology allowed and 

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:10.079
 therapies with visible materials that can be harvested from signals without effects 

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.729
 own that 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.939
 the advances in different technologies 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.509
 allows the creation of new ways to produce much more efficient pieces and 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.580
 abuses 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.460
 The cutting paint assembly of the same is carried out by machines 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.800
 computers that support the work of the operator and substantially improve the 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.270
 quality of time 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.720
 the development of the materials mimi the thickness and weight of the videos commenting 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.840
 other ballistic protection
