00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 You're right, you're talking to everyone. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.850
 want to take advantage of the last three 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 minutes of the final program I spoke to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.670
 to comment and I will have to comment on a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 little what we here like 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.380
 health professionals we have the duty to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.929
 do you right to talk a little bit 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.130
 people have seen in the media a lot has 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.570
 seen in the media that the government wants 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 bring health professionals and others 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.869
 countries is not bring of Cuba wants to do 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.760
 professional 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.529
 it does not matter if Europe can be 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.849
 You want to talk only about Cuba, wherever 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 to assert that he thinks it 's a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.200
 prejudice against a boy but see 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.550
 well people have to have a bit of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.210
 good sense of humor 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 each country has a method of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 have a teaching reach have 11 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.370
 do not know your typical local diseases 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.500
 neither finds nor is against the guilty doctor 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.430
 against mexico the country only has the council 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 of medicine that regulates the profession 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 it requires a professional from the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.680
 Brazil that there are faculties are and form 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.120
 good professionals and if a Brazilian 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.610
 get out of here will do in any other 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 place of the world a medical school 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 The Brazilian when he comes back here. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 have to revalidate the diploma 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.259
 Brazilian honey that leaves Brazil and goes 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.759
 make a medical school in another 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 country when you come back to what she 's obligated 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.040
 to do a revalidation of diploma proves 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.180
 to know if he did well 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 informed 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.930
 then it is a real absurdity or if the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 Brazilian will have any country 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 the medium formed here goes by any 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 country can not practice medicine until the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 the dentist also no dentist at all 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.770
 doctor and has to make a revalidation 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.799
 not only of knowledge of the profession 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.070
 but also because the language itself 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.630
 accident there is no communication is right 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 it is very difficult to make a thousandth 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.680
 so we see things from time to time. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.689
 when he does not know exactly why 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.439
 I think in Brazil, there's no shortage of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.659
 doctor is lacking in quality and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.360
 offer a good condition, it is logical that the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.290
 doctor who is here in São Paulo does not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 or from the interior of the Amazon to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.220
 meet people for nothing wins 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.930
 to not have treatment condition is not 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 So I'll tell you something to see how it is. 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.600
 whereas health 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 The country is talking last week. 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.490
 with a medical friend of mine who attends 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.390
 s right to the public service in the village 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.250
 mariana 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.200
 did not have suture thread 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.440
 pediatrics did not have disposable gloves 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.050
 to use that's right had to have donation 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.850
 some eyes because the government did not give 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.940
 I will not tell if the municipal fidam 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.490
 Importance of iran and public health 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 the salary is late and I'm talking like this 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.430
 in São Paulo capital of a neighborhood of 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.959
 middle class 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.270
 no use trying to cover the sun with 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.610
 sieve bring professionals of any 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.230
 in the world to house the structure 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.390
 has professionals who exist here 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.120
 because it's a career plan you want in 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.780
 interior or the interior side of manaus 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.800
 a deck 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.590
 aas the locals more that snoop and 9/15 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.480
 pitta has to give condition to people 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 and you have to pay and now you have to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.950
 to give salary the person invested ten years 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.209
 studying in college because taking everything 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.739
 that helped in life 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.080
 twenty-one years of study that did not 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.480
 earns nothing and has to give condition of 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.220
 work structure you do not have to give everything 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.900
 They have that so we have to talk. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.239
 can not pass beaten because 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.430
 to show that it is not a bias of the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.290
 country that the person comes from is the qualification 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.860
 which it has and government investment 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.600
 Brazilian population in health for the population 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.880
 is not cover the sun with the sieve is not 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.160
 make believe is true that for what 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.780
 we pay taxes to the population - it would 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.780
 have a much better service
