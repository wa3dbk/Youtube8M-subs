so if you live near a lush you may want

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399 
so if you live near a lush you may want
to<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.060> their<00:02:06.270> phone<00:02:06.450> number<00:02:06.750> first<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> then

call them to see if they have it in
stock<00:02:09.179> before<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.989> waste<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.440> time<00:02:10.679> popping

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
they're like I did on several occasions

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.510 
they're like I did on several occasions
another<00:02:13.820> option<00:02:14.210> would<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.510> buy<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.780> online

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
another option would be to buy it online

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.130 
another option would be to buy it online
however<00:02:16.520> I'm<00:02:16.910> looking<00:02:17.210> online<00:02:17.330> right<00:02:17.600> now<00:02:17.750> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
however I'm looking online right now and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
however I'm looking online right now and
it<00:02:18.470> says<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:18.950> out<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.100> stock<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.670> too

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
it says that it's out of stock there too

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.340 
it says that it's out of stock there too
so<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.240> hoping<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.660> by<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.930> time<00:02:21.200> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
so I'm hoping that by the time this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.230 
so I'm hoping that by the time this
video<00:02:21.500> goes<00:02:21.680> up<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.700> they<00:02:22.940> will<00:02:23.090> have

video goes up that they will have

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.790 
video goes up that they will have
restocked<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.410> go<00:02:24.560> online

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
restocked it so that you can go online

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.830 
restocked it so that you can go online
and<00:02:25.130> purchase<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:25.970> they<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.750> know

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840

restock pretty frequently over there
another<00:02:28.640> thing<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.150> will<00:02:29.210> say<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.810> online

another thing I will say is that online

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.040 
another thing I will say is that online
its<00:02:31.010> 1295<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.970> purchased<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.690> store

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
its 1295 and I purchased this in store

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.530 
its 1295 and I purchased this in store
for<00:02:33.350> 1450<00:02:34.070> now<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> don't<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:35.000> there<00:02:35.300> was<00:02:35.390> just

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
for 1450 now I don't know there was just

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.960 
for 1450 now I don't know there was just
a<00:02:35.690> huge<00:02:36.020> markup<00:02:36.440> where<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.400> bought<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.850> because

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
a huge markup where I bought it because

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.140 
a huge markup where I bought it because
I<00:02:38.120> bought<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:39.140> Miami<00:02:39.560> Beach<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.150> there's

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
I bought it on Miami Beach and there's

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.610 
I bought it on Miami Beach and there's
just<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.390> markup<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.750> everything<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.320> Miami

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
just the markup on everything on Miami

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.840 
just the markup on everything on Miami
Beach<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:42.980> don't<00:02:43.220> know<00:02:43.310> if<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.550> was<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
Beach so I don't know if that was the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.390 
Beach so I don't know if that was the
case<00:02:44.000> or<00:02:44.240> if<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.840> stores<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:46.220> more

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
case or if in stores it's just more

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.760 
case or if in stores it's just more
expensive<00:02:46.610> than<00:02:47.120> buying<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.510> online<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.140> that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
expensive than buying it online so that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
expensive than buying it online so that
is<00:02:49.040> an<00:02:49.280> option<00:02:49.640> for<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.210> you're<00:02:50.360> looking

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
is an option for you if you're looking

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.140 
is an option for you if you're looking
to<00:02:50.780> save<00:02:50.960> about<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> dollar<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.310> fifty<00:02:52.850> cents

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to save about a dollar and fifty cents

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
to save about a dollar and fifty cents
so<00:02:53.450> again<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.960> would<00:02:54.020> highly<00:02:54.500> highly<00:02:54.770> highly

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
so again I would highly highly highly

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.740 
so again I would highly highly highly
recommend<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:55.850> if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.150> are<00:02:56.240> looking<00:02:56.540> for

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
recommend this if you are looking for

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.200 
recommend this if you are looking for
something<00:02:56.950> new<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:57.980> try<00:02:58.460> especially<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.120> you

like<00:02:59.420> natural<00:02:59.660> products<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.860> charcoal<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
like natural products the charcoal is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.400 
like natural products the charcoal is
fantastic<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.420> think<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:02.840> does<00:03:03.140> draw

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
fantastic I think it really does draw

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.620 
fantastic I think it really does draw
out<00:03:03.560> impurities<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.370> then<00:03:04.550> wash<00:03:05.240> them<00:03:05.510> away

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
out impurities and then wash them away

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.780 
out impurities and then wash them away
and<00:03:06.050> then<00:03:06.260> after<00:03:06.590> you've<00:03:06.800> washed<00:03:07.400> your<00:03:07.550> face

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
and then after you've washed your face

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.000 
and then after you've washed your face
with<00:03:07.970> water<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.990> sort<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.260> feel<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
with water you can sort of feel the the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.180 
with water you can sort of feel the the
softness<00:03:10.910> from<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.990> avocado<00:03:12.290> oil<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.010> all

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
softness from the avocado oil and all

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.980 
softness from the avocado oil and all
the<00:03:13.220> other<00:03:13.460> essential<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.240> think<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.900> it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
the other essential is I think that it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.260 
the other essential is I think that it
does<00:03:15.140> just<00:03:15.380> come<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.920> hydrate<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.400> skin<00:03:16.430> even

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
does just come and hydrate the skin even

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.610 
does just come and hydrate the skin even
though<00:03:17.360> they<00:03:17.540> say<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:18.050> meant<00:03:18.230> for<00:03:18.290> oily

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
though they say that it's meant for oily

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.010 
though they say that it's meant for oily
skin<00:03:18.650> people<00:03:19.160> um<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:20.030> looks<00:03:20.330> like<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.960> is

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
skin people um it looks like this it is

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.550 
skin people um it looks like this it is
just<00:03:21.710> black<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.190> black<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.210> black<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.690> it

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
smells like charcoal and licorice so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.570 
smells like charcoal and licorice so
when<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.010> first<00:03:28.400> smelled<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.390> was<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:29.540> oh

somebody said that you actually because

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.470 
somebody said that you actually because
you<00:03:51.860> only<00:03:52.010> need<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.190> very<00:03:52.280> small<00:03:52.790> amount<00:03:53.120> when

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
you only need a very small amount when

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.430 
you only need a very small amount when
you're<00:03:53.600> using<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.960> like<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.170> need<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.320> a

you're using it like you need like a
pea-sized<00:03:54.980> amount<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.520> what<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:56.060> recommends<00:03:56.570> I

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
pea-sized amount is what it recommends I

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.030 
pea-sized amount is what it recommends I
usually<00:03:56.960> use<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.110> little<00:03:57.470> bit<00:03:57.530> more<00:03:57.740> than<00:03:57.890> that

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
usually use a little bit more than that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.100 
usually use a little bit more than that
but<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.700> won't<00:03:58.820> since<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.270> only<00:03:59.450> are<00:03:59.690> using<00:04:00.020> a

but you won't since you only are using a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.140 
but you won't since you only are using a
small<00:04:00.470> teeny<00:04:00.680> tiny<00:04:01.010> bit<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.430> will<00:04:01.760> act<00:04:01.970> this

small teeny tiny bit you will act this

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.450 
small teeny tiny bit you will act this
will<00:04:02.330> actually<00:04:02.450> go<00:04:02.720> bad<00:04:02.960> before<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:04.010> use<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
will actually go bad before you use the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.460 
will actually go bad before you use the
entire<00:04:04.580> thing<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.240> you<00:04:05.810> may<00:04:06.110> want<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.320> get<00:04:06.410> a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
that's probably what I'm going to do is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.000 
that's probably what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:13.049> school<00:04:13.290> split<00:04:13.469> it<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.620> half<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.980> then

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
I'm school split it in half and then

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.949 
I'm school split it in half and then
send<00:04:14.310> some<00:04:14.430> other<00:04:14.579> people<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.510> parts<00:04:15.900> of

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
send some other people a little parts of

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.259 
send some other people a little parts of
it<00:04:16.079> because<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.470> want<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.859> go<00:04:16.949> bad

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it because I don't want it to go bad

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.849

probably won't use it by the time that
it<00:04:21.660> expires<00:04:22.019> because<00:04:22.470> there's<00:04:22.650> not<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:23.759> a

try to remember because I don't want

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.339 
try to remember because I don't want
this<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.220> go<00:04:44.759> bad<00:04:44.970> again<00:04:45.300> because<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.630> was<00:04:45.720> 1450

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
this to go bad again because it was 1450

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.629 
this to go bad again because it was 1450
which<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.530> actually<00:04:46.889> you<00:04:47.130> know<00:04:47.220> pretty<00:04:47.490> good

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
which is actually you know pretty good

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.640 
which is actually you know pretty good
price<00:04:47.880> considering<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.930> face<00:04:49.139> product

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
price considering it's a face product

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.279 
price considering it's a face product
and<00:04:49.889> it's<00:04:50.490> natural<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.810> lasts<00:04:52.169> forever

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
and it's natural and it lasts forever

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.760 
and it's natural and it lasts forever
and<00:04:53.509> you<00:04:54.509> only<00:04:54.660> need<00:04:54.840> small<00:04:55.229> amounts<00:04:55.650> when

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
and you only need small amounts when

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.020 
and you only need small amounts when
you're<00:04:55.889> using<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.430> don't<00:04:56.580> think<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you're using it so I don't think the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.850 
you're using it so I don't think the
price<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.240> bad<00:04:57.539> at<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:57.900> but<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.710> would

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
price is bad at all but I would

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.680 
price is bad at all but I would
recommend<00:04:59.400> getting<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.729> small<00:05:00.120> jar<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.599> not

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
recommend getting a small jar and not

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.060 
recommend getting a small jar and not
the<00:05:00.840> big<00:05:00.990> jar<00:05:01.169> especially<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:01.710> you're<00:05:01.830> using

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
the big jar especially if you're using

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.490 
the big jar especially if you're using
it<00:05:02.310> by<00:05:02.520> yourself<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.599> next<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.050> will<00:05:04.169> see<00:05:04.349> me

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
it by yourself so next you will see me

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.010 
it by yourself so next you will see me
actually<00:05:04.650> using<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> product<00:05:05.669> and<00:05:06.180> I'll<00:05:06.870> just

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
actually using the product and I'll just

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.689 
actually using the product and I'll just
show<00:05:07.199> you<00:05:07.259> sort<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.919> what<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.250> looks<00:05:08.400> like<00:05:08.520> and

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
show you sort of what it looks like and

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.580 
show you sort of what it looks like and
the<00:05:08.849> mess<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.449> creates<00:05:09.750> because<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.289> can

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the mess that it creates because it can

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.100 
the mess that it creates because it can
get<00:05:10.770> pretty<00:05:11.160> messy<00:05:11.479> okay<00:05:12.479> so<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.720> first<00:05:12.930> thing

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
get pretty messy okay so the first thing

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.779 
get pretty messy okay so the first thing
I<00:05:13.199> do<00:05:13.259> is<00:05:13.560> just<00:05:13.590> grab<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.979> little<00:05:14.220> teeny<00:05:14.520> tiny

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
I do is just grab a little teeny tiny

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.430 
I do is just grab a little teeny tiny
bit<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.150> little<00:05:15.389> more<00:05:15.570> than<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.750> pea-sized<00:05:16.139> and

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
bit a little more than a pea-sized and

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.439 
bit a little more than a pea-sized and
then<00:05:16.620> start<00:05:16.949> dropping<00:05:17.430> some<00:05:17.699> water<00:05:17.909> in<00:05:18.150> and

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
then start dropping some water in and

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.080 
then start dropping some water in and
then<00:05:18.990> creating<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.740> paste<00:05:20.099> now<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.970> is

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
then creating a paste now this is

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.420 
then creating a paste now this is
probably<00:05:21.599> up<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.930> preference<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.710> like<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.340> to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
probably up to preference I like it to

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.300 
probably up to preference I like it to
be<00:05:23.460> kind<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.210> thick<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.770> don't<00:05:25.889> know<00:05:26.039> paste

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
be kind of thick and I don't know paste

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.670 
be kind of thick and I don't know paste
like<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:27.240> once<00:05:27.570> it's<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.930> consistency<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.620> I

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
like so once it's the consistency that I

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.980 
like so once it's the consistency that I
want<00:05:28.770> then<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.370> just<00:05:29.729> start<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.240> apply<00:05:30.659> it<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.900> my
