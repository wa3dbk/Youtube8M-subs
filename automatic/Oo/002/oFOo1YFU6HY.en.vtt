put it on your extensions while the hair
is<00:02:09.250> wet<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.360> only<00:02:10.570> time<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.929> recommend

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
is wet this is the only time I recommend

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.080 
is wet this is the only time I recommend
putting<00:02:11.680> some<00:02:12.100> type<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.280> oil<00:02:12.549> on<00:02:12.940> your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
putting some type of oil on your

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
putting some type of oil on your
extensions<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.870> because<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.489> to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
extensions is because it's not going to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.100 
extensions is because it's not going to
leave<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.150> heavy<00:02:17.010> coating<00:02:18.010> or<00:02:18.540> product<00:02:19.540> buildup

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
leave a heavy coating or product buildup

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.259 
leave a heavy coating or product buildup
on<00:02:20.290> your<00:02:20.470> hair<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.950> find<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.700> when<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.000> use<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
on your hair I find that when you use it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.600 
on your hair I find that when you use it
while<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.750> wet<00:02:23.019> once<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.620> dries<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.890> locks

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
while it's wet once it dries it locks

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.250 
while it's wet once it dries it locks
into<00:02:24.880> place<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.540> you're<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.840> going<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.110> have
