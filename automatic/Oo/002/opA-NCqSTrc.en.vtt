00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.830

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:18.830
 miss lady this lady 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.570
 I had a lot of fun listening to the newly 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 as well 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.629
 to comment marcela of all those who 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 We talk and I like all the jury 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:53.219
 the lonely wig no one knew now no 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.880
 we hope what conclusion you draw from that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.770
 talk that you had with moria 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.330
 since they hate darcy and it seems to me that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.520
 Today, today's meeting is going to be terrible 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.270
 I do not know how he will have taken the solitaire 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.740
 wig I do not think mirtha does not 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.480
 I wanted to talk a lot about the subject when 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 mixed asks him freshly pauli 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.890
 presented and showed and covered no no 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
 he preferred not to give answers he just wanted 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 speak because I say have fun are 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 friends clear respect to them they looked for 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 marcela as you think it will end this 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460
 jury 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.909
 the other day what I perceived as if 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.360
 I knew something had happened I did not know that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.689
 exactly but I did notice that they are 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.240
 nacha memory against solita va no se si si 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.310
 against they are not really united is not 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.130
 a question that whispers time as 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 they talk to each other yes yes yes yes yes 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.909
 ranch itself apart as directed to request not 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.709
 I never understood why where he started 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.420
 started with what we 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.799
 we were really surprised when we 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.799
 we found out that he did not want more 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.849
 they hate us because they think they are 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.500
 on radio and we do not see anything of the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.360
 gestures they make and the things that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.890
 they say in a low way you understand me and that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.410
 we are going to forgive you equally what 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.940
 accused punctually is that what he said 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.799
 the other day before the phrase pete 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.200
 skills to solitude silveyra that the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.970
 production a producer is like in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.970
 sanitized in wanting to break this jury 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:41.319
 and they 're not just going to sit in a chair 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.060
 of track to throw darts for 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.090
 movie where the pilot is to hit him 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.370
 with masked like I do not know today is going to be 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.560
 a hot day 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.540
 I would like to see how they kill each other 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.780
 because imagine after this end of 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.220
 week where he already resigned me for nothing in 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.120
 the che should not be good for him I heard 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.120
 I speak and other 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.140
 what this woman said if for what 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.900
 memory is like this because something happened is 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.150
 in how swollen they should already make a 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.769
 therapy with marcelo contains I think that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.690
 like you should do a series 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.500
 should be implanted and do that therapy 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.500
 to see what happens 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.099
 they finished all friends pachano graciela 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.090
 he remembers that it will transport him almost 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.530
 gave this really 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.180
 marcela mar now to you as 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.239
 participants play against whoever is 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.950
 how are you so lost from the jury or 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.230
 going through a situation like that because 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.989
 It has to stay and the weather is not what I 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.610
 patient if it was weird the weather was weird 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.610
 he gave you the ok or if you see that I'm already 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:52.780
 accustomed to that they can detect everything 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.780
 So I also am 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.019
 what you will perceive as a weird climate 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:06.379
 later I found out about everything 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.540
 said brother to walk I told you so 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.120
 I was preparing, they tell me what 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.129
 night I tedÃ© that hurt that not a little 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.340
 the centrists and you without you as weird 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.060
 you saw but 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.100
 I do not know maybe I was sensitive 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.780
 despite this that you felt no 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.010
 while you were attractive when you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 you went out on the track now talking 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.340
 promptly I say that it happened to you 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.810
 because really your previous for those who 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.720
 we saw it or at least for me in what 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.040
 I found the staff broke in 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840
 the previous one punctually as we can 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.400
 talk about dancing but I say punctually 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.020
 in the previous it seems to me that you took her 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.940
 super good that you managed and paris 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.220
 previous does not prepare premiere beautiful city 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.930
 very quiet king good what happens that 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.380
 I did an exercise to see me 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.380
 quiet 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:57.530
 and I was very nervous if it's something that 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.439
 I never did get management to cameras 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.419
 but it's not the same to dance then I 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.580
 what I had seen was from some 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.080
 participants so new from me had I had 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.879
 transmitted a lot of nervousness and that I 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.430
 that I do not want to transmit in order to see 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.039
 later the rest I can better worse not me 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.539
 matter but and the movie rewards her 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.039
 I knew what I was going to do because of what 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.360
 he spoke that if he did not know that he was going to 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.360
 like tinelli or not good let's see
