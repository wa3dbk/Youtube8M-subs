these sneakers is I definitely have

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.290 
these sneakers is I definitely have
wider<00:00:27.449> feet<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.310> maybe<00:00:29.310> normal<00:00:29.970> people<00:00:30.179> my

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
wider feet then maybe normal people my

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.299 
wider feet then maybe normal people my
size<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.689> guess<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
size I guess I don't really know but

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.120 
size I guess I don't really know but
these<00:00:32.520> things<00:00:32.880> fit<00:00:33.149> extremely<00:00:33.480> snug<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.770> had

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
these things fit extremely snug so I had

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910 
these things fit extremely snug so I had
to<00:00:35.219> make<00:00:35.460> them<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> fit<00:00:36.899> away<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to make them kind of fit away that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
to make them kind of fit away that
worked<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.460> myself<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.180> think<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.660> one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
worked for myself and I think that's one

detailed look at the sneaker and I am a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
detailed look at the sneaker and I am a
fan<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> them<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> model<00:02:21.810> believe<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.110> or

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
fan of them of the model believe it or

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.220 
fan of them of the model believe it or
not<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.610> flagship<00:02:24.060> model<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
not it's not the flagship model the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.010 
not it's not the flagship model the
soldiers<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.770> kind<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.430> under<00:02:27.020> like

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
soldiers are kind of like the under like

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.930 
soldiers are kind of like the under like
the<00:02:28.260> lower<00:02:28.440> version<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.250> guess<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the lower version I guess of the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.690 
the lower version I guess of the
flagship<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.580> eighth

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
flagship but the this is the eighth

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
flagship but the this is the eighth
rendition<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.110> going

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
rendition so it's not one that's going

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.190 
rendition so it's not one that's going
away<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:36.990> not<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
away and just because it's not the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.840 
away and just because it's not the
flagship<00:02:37.590> doesn't<00:02:37.920> mean<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.580> good

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
flagship doesn't mean it's not a good

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.620 
flagship doesn't mean it's not a good
