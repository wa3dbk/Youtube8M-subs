it's<00:01:35.070> quite<00:01:35.520> subtle<00:01:35.910> but<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.780> big

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it's quite subtle but that's a big

it's quite subtle but that's a big
improvement<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.120> make<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.630> shot<00:01:42.900> look

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
improvement you can make the shot look

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
improvement you can make the shot look
very<00:01:43.440> different<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.100> changing<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.910> size<00:01:45.150> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
very different by changing the size of

very different by changing the size of
the<00:01:45.480> backdrop<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> using<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.010> zoom<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:48.050> the

set workshop let's select the image and
use<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.410> scaling<00:01:52.920> tool<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.310> make<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> bigger

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
use the scaling tool to make it bigger

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.640 
use the scaling tool to make it bigger
we<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> change<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> camera<00:01:57.030> view

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
we can see the change in the camera view

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650 
we can see the change in the camera view
let's<00:01:58.650> move<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.980> camera<00:01:59.220> around<00:01:59.640> to<00:02:00.330> see<00:02:00.510> how
