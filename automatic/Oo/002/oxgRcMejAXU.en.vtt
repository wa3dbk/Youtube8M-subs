00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.150
 palim palim bocket about friends today 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.100
 I have a slightly different video for 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.559
 you and it is not a booster open 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.610
 But air also has something to do with pokémon 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.109
 Do and a 3ds as you see here or 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.259
 a ds I just have to catch something 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.920
 before I show what I show you 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.349
 I want to be black and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.740
 white out comes a so-called shining 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.590
 the hand there so I run over indiscriminately 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.600
 the routes and search for chaney pokémon 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.460
 and who is a bit sham 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.890
 does not know who knows that this rate 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.690
 a genius is pretty high 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.989
 So one to eight thousand a month beat you 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.039
 dead 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.989
 that's pretty much a lot 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.420
 Never have to make a mistake before you 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.000
 a genius finds and I 'm holding me 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.640
 sometime thought yes if I did 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.199
 just randomly through the area and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.109
 took so long to get a genie com 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.250
 that worked pretty well too 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.110
 but at some point stopped it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 because I want to do things with others 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.340
 I've been busy and recently 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.880
 a certain person back on it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.970
 brought 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.259
 Cheney to handen so to hunt 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.450
 my sweat and black and white 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.860
 version so on my white edition 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.780
 and yes I wanted you this time 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:37.880
 show what I have just discovered and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:41.240
 Although you can still focus on one 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 a little bit of eve haas genius 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.210
 clearly it is gray and dark motto 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.680
 I've got gray burgundy guessing dark 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.719
 orange so i just take it now 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.180
 this color combination and otherwise is 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.680
 some lighter 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.590
 Here you can see my beloved rapport 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.740
 mine is always from my first play 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.350
 so to speak 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.990
 and yes I did not relate or anything 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.600
 that's my up here so is 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.950
 my my white edition pack 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 apologizes 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.489
 which took about one and a half days 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.590
 I say so then took me 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.769
 until it barely falls during the last shining 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.080
 and what is a big neither 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.060
 male but serious the person the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.090
 me the sparkle has asked the hearts 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.819
 dedicate this pokémon and now 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:40.910

 so boni france is sleeping 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.799

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.799
 237 is already 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:24.670

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.730
 and that alex 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:23.440
