to you how hackers crash websites and
denial<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> service<00:00:53.760> attacks<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.269> illegal<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
denial of service attacks are illegal so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
denial of service attacks are illegal so
if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.850> decide<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> one

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
if you actually just decide to do one

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.369 
if you actually just decide to do one
I'm<00:00:57.869> not<00:00:58.140> responsible<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.190> keep<00:00:59.940> watching

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379

I'm not responsible so keep watching
with<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.589> thing<00:01:01.979> with<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.489> said<00:01:02.729> in

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:02.939 
with this thing with what I just said in

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:12.800 
with this thing with what I just said in
mind<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:10.399> try<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.460> most<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.000> well<00:01:12.539> in<00:01:12.690> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
mind now try the most like well in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.630 
mind now try the most like well in the
one<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.550> well-known<00:01:15.450> type<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.869> dead

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
one way of it well-known type of dead

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.719 
one way of it well-known type of dead
time<00:01:17.640> denial<00:01:18.149> of<00:01:18.270> service<00:01:18.569> attack<00:01:18.929> he's<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.699 

the<00:01:23.729> ping<00:01:24.090> flood<00:01:24.299> attack<00:01:27.200> which<00:01:28.200> basically

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
the ping flood attack which basically

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.919 
the ping flood attack which basically
means<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.280> send<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:29.819> much<00:01:30.000> data<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.630> server

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
means you send so much data to a server

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.779 
means you send so much data to a server
that<00:01:31.110> eventually<00:01:31.590> overloads<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> crashes<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.210 

so<00:01:38.789> how<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.690> do<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.050> ping<00:01:40.410> flood<00:01:40.590> attack<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
so how do we do a ping flood attack on

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
so how do we do a ping flood attack on
OSX<00:01:41.789> is<00:01:42.410> you<00:01:43.410> would<00:01:49.910> open<00:01:50.910> terminal<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
OSX is you would open terminal if you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.809 
OSX is you would open terminal if you
want<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.099> have<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.489> but<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.789> want

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
want you don't have to but if you want

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.639 
want you don't have to but if you want
to<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.269> the<00:01:54.420> IP<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:54.780> website<00:01:55.289> would<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to get the IP the website would just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.550 
to get the IP the website would just
type<00:01:55.830> house<00:01:56.190> say<00:01:57.019> whatever<00:01:58.019> website<00:01:58.349> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
type house say whatever website you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.710 
type house say whatever website you
wanted<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.160> launch<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.940> attack<00:02:00.030> against

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:13.380 

herbs<00:02:03.720> or<00:02:03.869> google.com<00:02:04.379> is<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:05.009> example

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:26.140 

and<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.799> yeah<00:02:19.239> end<00:02:20.239> up<00:02:23.140> then<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.879> would<00:02:26.000> just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and so yeah end up then you would just

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.210 
and so yeah end up then you would just
hide<00:02:26.769> pseudo<00:02:28.030> ping<00:02:30.400> -<00:02:31.400> F<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.950> ping<00:02:33.950> means

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
hide pseudo ping - F and ping means

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.080 
hide pseudo ping - F and ping means
flood<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:36.799> all<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.189> versions<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.670> OS<00:02:37.790> X

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
flood and on all the versions of OS X

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.789 
flood and on all the versions of OS X
you<00:02:38.180> might<00:02:38.299> not<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.900> use<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.349> know<00:02:39.409> to<00:02:39.560> do

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
you might not have to use you know to do

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.339 
you might not have to use you know to do
the<00:02:39.950> duty<00:02:40.939> the<00:02:40.970> paying<00:02:41.269> flood<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.170> you're

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
the duty the paying flood but if you're

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.569

know now to attack a website especially
a<00:03:12.950> huge<00:03:13.310> website<00:03:13.659> my<00:03:14.950> Google<00:03:15.950> you'd<00:03:16.159> have<00:03:16.370> to

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
a huge website my Google you'd have to

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.119 
a huge website my Google you'd have to
have<00:03:17.659> a<00:03:17.720> lot<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.109> different<00:03:18.560> computers<00:03:18.799> doing

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
have a lot of different computers doing

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.229 
have a lot of different computers doing
and<00:03:19.280> watch<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:19.609> there's<00:03:19.790> no<00:03:19.909> way<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.090> could

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
and watch like there's no way you could

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.729 
and watch like there's no way you could
do<00:03:20.389> it<00:03:21.489> by<00:03:22.489> yourself<00:03:22.940> from<00:03:23.599> you<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.109> stop<00:03:24.379> this

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.490 

but<00:03:27.739> eventually<00:03:27.979> what<00:03:28.370> would<00:03:28.549> happen<00:03:29.500> what

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
but eventually what would happen what

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.180 
but eventually what would happen what
the<00:03:31.069> novel<00:03:31.250> service<00:03:31.729> attack<00:03:32.030> does<00:03:32.419> is<00:03:32.900> a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
the novel service attack does is a

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.890 
the novel service attack does is a
renders<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.340> website<00:03:34.729> unusable<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:37.900> cuz

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
renders the website unusable I like cuz
