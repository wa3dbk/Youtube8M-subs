00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
check the turn as well I was going to

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.610 
check the turn as well I was going to
ask<00:05:58.360> you<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.510> something<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.960> do<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> stop<00:05:59.320> and<00:05:59.470> go

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
ask you to something to do a stop and go

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
ask you to something to do a stop and go
there<00:05:59.830> when<00:05:59.979> it<00:06:00.039> calls<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.460> then<00:06:00.550> maybe

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
there when it calls and then maybe

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.200 
there when it calls and then maybe
leaves<00:06:00.940> out<00:06:01.120> on<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.270> turn<00:06:03.000> certainly<00:06:04.000> wouldn't

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
leaves out on a turn certainly wouldn't

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.460 
leaves out on a turn certainly wouldn't
be<00:06:04.300> worth<00:06:04.510> playing<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.930> world<00:06:05.080> is<00:06:05.229> what's

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
be worth playing the world is what's

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.740 
be worth playing the world is what's
needed<00:06:05.650> right<00:06:05.860> now

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.660 

I<00:06:11.840> really<00:06:12.560> think<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.830> reason<00:06:13.070> to<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.400> check

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
I really think the reason to the check

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.890 
I really think the reason to the check
on<00:06:13.790> the<00:06:13.880> flop<00:06:14.090> was<00:06:14.300> because<00:06:14.540> Chris<00:06:14.720> Ferguson

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
on the flop was because Chris Ferguson

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.900 
on the flop was because Chris Ferguson
was<00:06:15.170> in<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.350> pod<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:16.040> one<00:06:16.430> score<00:06:16.640> different

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
was in the pod and one score different

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.000 
was in the pod and one score different
kind<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.150> doubt<00:06:17.330> I<00:06:17.930> think<00:06:18.470> you<00:06:18.530> can<00:06:18.680> put<00:06:18.800> a<00:06:18.830> hand

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
kind of doubt I think you can put a hand

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:28.180 
kind of doubt I think you can put a hand
a<00:06:19.070> little<00:06:19.160> more<00:06:19.400> aggressively

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.250 

you
