strategy but it's for ages five there's
a<00:05:14.160> little<00:05:14.550> bit<00:05:14.700> how<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.910> use<00:05:15.270> your<00:05:15.480> cards

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.900 
a little bit how you use your cards
definitely<00:05:16.440> will<00:05:16.680> impact<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.220> game<00:05:17.430> who<00:05:17.670> you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
definitely will impact the game who you

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.240 
definitely will impact the game who you
