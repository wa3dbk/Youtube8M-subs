we're<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.920> handy-dandy

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
we're going to be using this handy-dandy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.950 
we're going to be using this handy-dandy
radioshack<00:01:30.810> tie<00:01:31.530> clip<00:01:31.920> microphone<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> we're

radioshack tie clip microphone and we're

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
radioshack tie clip microphone and we're
going<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.140> try<00:01:34.380> attaching<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.400> lapel

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.719 
going to try attaching that to my lapel
and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.570> attaching<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.439> line<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> camera

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and then attaching a line to the camera

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
and then attaching a line to the camera
i<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:38.939> bought<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.450> extra<00:01:39.780> long<00:01:40.130> cable<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
i also bought an extra long cable that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
i also bought an extra long cable that
will<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:42.000> me<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.360> 20<00:01:42.630> feet<00:01:42.840> away<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
will get me up to 20 feet away from the
camera<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.950> i<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> far<00:01:45.450> away<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.020> still

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
so this is a really cool idea in theory

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.200

you<00:02:56.060> might<00:02:56.210> have<00:02:56.330> an<00:02:56.420> even<00:02:56.660> easier<00:02:56.810> time

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
you might have an even easier time

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.810 
you might have an even easier time
getting<00:02:57.260> your<00:02:57.620> video<00:02:57.890> into<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.100> computer<00:02:58.580> for

getting your video into the computer for

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.370 
getting your video into the computer for
me<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.120> little<00:02:59.270> bit<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.720> challenge<00:02:59.750> but

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
me a little bit more of a challenge but

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.960 
me a little bit more of a challenge but
ultimately<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.980> quality<00:03:01.340> may<00:03:01.460> end<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:01.760> being

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
ultimately the quality may end up being

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.050 
ultimately the quality may end up being
the<00:03:02.030> best<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:02.750> there<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.620> go<00:03:03.650> review<00:03:04.520> of<00:03:04.550> video

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the best so there we go review of video
