showing<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.850> couple<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.630> hiding<00:00:34.050> places

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
showing you is a couple of hiding places

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.720 
showing you is a couple of hiding places
to<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.910> won't<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> call<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
to get to get when we won't you call it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.979 
to get to get when we won't you call it
just<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> better<00:00:42.149> view<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> enemy

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
just to get a better view of the enemy

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
just to get a better view of the enemy
and<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.590> higher<00:00:44.010> elevation<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and to have higher elevation so that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
and to have higher elevation so that
they<00:00:45.030> can't<00:00:45.270> find<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> need

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
they can't find you so what you need

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.959 
they can't find you so what you need
first<00:00:47.670> off<00:00:48.350> if<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> gear<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.789> have

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
first off if you go to gear up you have

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.560 
first off if you go to gear up you have
to<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.780> gravity<00:00:52.500> hook<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> would

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
to have the gravity hook so that would

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.529 
to have the gravity hook so that would
be<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> gravity

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
be that you have to have that gravity

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.229 
be that you have to have that gravity
hook<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.260> any<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.620> weapons<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.969> i

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
hook and then any other weapons like i

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
hook and then any other weapons like i
have<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> plasma<00:01:01.559> cannon<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> rocket<00:01:02.870> i'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
have a plasma cannon or the rocket i'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
have a plasma cannon or the rocket i'm
just<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.290> gravity<00:01:04.739> hammer

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
just going to have gravity hammer

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.969 
just going to have gravity hammer
gravity<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:06.659> door<00:01:06.869> girlier<00:01:07.140> gravity<00:01:07.830> hook

gravity side door girlier gravity hook

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
gravity side door girlier gravity hook
then<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:10.020> rocket<00:01:10.439> launcher<00:01:12.080> now<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
then the rocket launcher now this just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.260 
then the rocket launcher now this just
for<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.369> i'm<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.119> showing

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
for this i'm just going to be showing

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
for this i'm just going to be showing
you<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.630> bots<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.220> bots<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.820> move

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you with bots and bots don't really move

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
you with bots and bots don't really move
so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.689> won't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> would

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so you won't really see what it would

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
so you won't really see what it would
really<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.720> i'll<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> show<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
really be like but i'll just show you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.070 
really be like but i'll just show you
the<00:01:22.439> spots<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:24.030> hang<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.720> mana<00:01:24.930> me

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the spots so you can in hang on mana me

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.800 
the spots so you can in hang on mana me
so<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.030> couple<00:01:27.060> spots<00:01:27.450> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so this these are just a couple spots on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.730 
so this these are just a couple spots on
unreal<00:01:29.030> probably<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.810> easiest<00:01:31.229> math<00:01:31.470> dying

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
unreal probably the easiest math dying

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
unreal probably the easiest math dying
on<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.790> only<00:01:32.880> map

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
on because there's this the only map

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.810 
on because there's this the only map
with<00:01:33.390> Hank<00:01:34.320> spots<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
with Hank spots so what you do is it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
with Hank spots so what you do is it
when<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> spawn<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.650> main

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
when you spawn here on this main

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.899 
when you spawn here on this main
platform<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> want<00:01:40.079> aim<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> black<00:01:41.579> up

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
platform you want aim at this black up

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.260 
platform you want aim at this black up
here<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> fire<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> graph<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:45.060> you'll

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
here and fire the graph up and you'll

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.990 
here and fire the graph up and you'll
fog<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.430> come<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:47.820> down

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fog out here and then come back down

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.590 
fog out here and then come back down
here<00:01:48.860> now<00:01:49.860> next<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.030> there

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here now next what you want to do there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
here now next what you want to do there
are<00:01:51.780> multiple<00:01:52.079> spots<00:01:52.350> out<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.590> quickly<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
are multiple spots out here quickly you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
are multiple spots out here quickly you
can<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> yellow<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can go to that yellow but that's not the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
can go to that yellow but that's not the
highest<00:01:55.649> spot<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.689> for

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
highest spot and what you want to do for

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.020 
highest spot and what you want to do for
this<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.140> ledge<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.640> above<00:01:59.850> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this little ledge which is right above a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
this little ledge which is right above a
