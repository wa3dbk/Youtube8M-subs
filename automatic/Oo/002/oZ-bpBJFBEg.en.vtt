00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
whether the the training that you put in

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.869 
whether the the training that you put in
for<00:00:14.409> this<00:00:14.589> winter<00:00:14.860> be<00:00:15.070> different<00:00:15.459> than<00:00:15.610> it<00:00:15.730> has

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
in the last three years because the tour

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.440 
in the last three years because the tour

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
single single interval he told me to do

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.639 
single single interval he told me to do
every<00:00:55.360> single<00:00:55.480> day<00:00:55.660> I<00:00:55.840> didn't<00:00:56.200> cut<00:00:56.380> anything

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
every single day I didn't cut anything

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.290 
every single day I didn't cut anything
short<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.920> when<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:01.030> get<00:01:01.149> on<00:01:01.270> the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
short and just when you get on the

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.229 
short and just when you get on the
starting<00:01:01.750> rampa<00:01:02.079> that<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.590> prologue<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
starting rampa that the prologue you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.140 
starting rampa that the prologue you
know<00:01:04.329> you<00:01:04.740> have<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:08.700> confidence<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.060> the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
know you have the confidence and the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.660 
know you have the confidence and the
ability<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.409> push<00:01:11.620> yourself<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.250> maximum

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
ability to push yourself to the maximum

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.180 
ability to push yourself to the maximum
there's<00:01:13.090> no<00:01:13.360> fear<00:01:14.170> or<00:01:14.380> doubt<00:01:14.530> holding<00:01:15.130> you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
there's no fear or doubt holding you

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.590 
there's no fear or doubt holding you
back<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:18.130> going<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.369> depend<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.820> Max's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
back so it's going to depend on Max's

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.160 
back so it's going to depend on Max's
training<00:01:20.049> but<00:01:20.170> I'm<00:01:20.260> hoping<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.070> it's<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:22.170> lot

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
training but I'm hoping that it's a lot

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.740 
training but I'm hoping that it's a lot
less<00:01:23.380> intensive<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.340> winter<00:01:24.670> do<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.510> think

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
less intensive this winter do you think

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.340 
less intensive this winter do you think
that<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.440> moving<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> maybe<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.990> able<00:01:29.080> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that the moving it is a maybe be able to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.780 
that the moving it is a maybe be able to
arrive<00:01:29.619> at<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.979> Tour<00:01:30.220> de<00:01:30.310> France<00:01:30.520> with<00:01:30.760> a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
arrive at the Tour de France with a

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.630 
arrive at the Tour de France with a
little<00:01:31.030> bit<00:01:31.210> more<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.890> won't<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.189> these<00:01:33.369> two

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
little bit more you won't have these two

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.240 
little bit more you won't have these two
huge<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.390> know<00:01:34.420> big<00:01:34.810> peak<00:01:35.080> early<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.920> then

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
huge you know big peak early and then

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.429 
huge you know big peak early and then
you<00:01:37.060> know<00:01:37.180> another<00:01:37.420> big<00:01:37.659> peak<00:01:37.869> later<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
you know another big peak later on the

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.789 
you know another big peak later on the
season<00:01:38.830> or<00:01:38.979> or<00:01:39.460> right<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.150> think<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:40.750> yeah<00:01:41.020> I

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
season or or right I think so yeah I

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.340 
season or or right I think so yeah I
think<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.820> makes<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.150> simpler<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.080> fact

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
think it makes it simpler in the fact

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.789 
think it makes it simpler in the fact
that<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:45.400> just<00:01:45.580> slowly<00:01:45.909> build<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:47.500> may

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
that I can just slowly build for may

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.570 
that I can just slowly build for may
june<00:01:47.830> july<00:01:48.250> i<00:01:48.580> mean<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.210> last<00:01:49.390> four<00:01:49.720> years

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580

june july i mean the last four years
like<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:51.610> said<00:01:51.759> I'm<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.210> trained<00:01:52.450> really<00:01:52.720> intense

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
like I said I'm a trained really intense

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.380 
like I said I'm a trained really intense
and<00:01:53.560> push<00:01:54.369> myself

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and push myself

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.230 
and push myself
in<00:01:56.570> December<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.560> January<00:01:57.700> for<00:01:58.700> tour<00:01:59.150> of

california in February and then and then
just<00:02:02.870> kind<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.080> try<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.350> hang<00:02:03.650> on<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.070> form

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
just kind of try to hang on to that form

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.630 
just kind of try to hang on to that form
at<00:02:05.060> some<00:02:05.390> point<00:02:05.600> take<00:02:05.869> some<00:02:06.080> rest<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.650> try<00:02:07.580> to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
at some point take some rest and try to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.790 
at some point take some rest and try to
rebuild<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.569> it's<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:09.050> difficult<00:02:09.560> because

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
rebuild and it's it's difficult because

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.130 
rebuild and it's it's difficult because
you<00:02:10.039> don't<00:02:10.490> really<00:02:10.550> know<00:02:10.910> how<00:02:11.240> you're<00:02:12.050> going

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
you don't really know how you're going

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.050 
you don't really know how you're going
to<00:02:12.260> come<00:02:12.410> out<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:13.070> mean<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.760> last

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
to come out of that I mean this last

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.840 
to come out of that I mean this last
year<00:02:14.620> won<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> Tour<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> California<00:02:16.130> and

year won the Tour of California and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.000 
year won the Tour of California and
Castillo<00:02:17.420> Lyon<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> tour<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
Castillo Lyon and then the tour of the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.180 
Castillo Lyon and then the tour of the
Gila<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.600> kaming<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> Giro<00:02:21.020> still<00:02:21.440> firing<00:02:21.860> on

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
Gila and kaming the Giro still firing on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.699 
Gila and kaming the Giro still firing on
all<00:02:22.280> cylinders<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:23.120> then<00:02:24.050> started<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> have

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
all cylinders that then started to have

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.070 
all cylinders that then started to have
some<00:02:24.860> bad<00:02:25.100> days<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> Giro<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.810> think

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
some bad days in the Giro and I think

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.930 
some bad days in the Giro and I think
it's<00:02:27.200> normal<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.280> knew<00:02:28.550> can't

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
it's normal that you just knew can't

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.260 
it's normal that you just knew can't
keep<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.970> certain<00:02:31.970> level

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
keep going like on that certain level

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.290 
keep going like on that certain level
for<00:02:32.480> soaps<00:02:32.750> for<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.230> long<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.030> then<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.209> know

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
for soaps for so long and then you know

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.660 
for soaps for so long and then you know
had<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> good<00:02:36.410> rest<00:02:36.650> after<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.010> Giro<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
how it would have worked out if I was

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.240

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
was flying on the bike all the way to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.280 
was flying on the bike all the way to
the<00:04:01.820> rest<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.150> year<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.140> was<00:04:03.260> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
the rest of the year so that was a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.630 
the rest of the year so that was a
little<00:04:03.380> more<00:04:03.560> simple<00:04:03.950> because<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
little more simple because of the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.130 
little more simple because of the
the<00:04:05.150> time<00:04:05.390> frame<00:04:05.660> is<00:04:06.010> larger<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.900> I'm<00:04:08.900> looking

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
the time frame is larger so I'm looking

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.770 
the time frame is larger so I'm looking
forward<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.620> 2010<00:04:10.310> because<00:04:10.730> like<00:04:11.390> i<00:04:11.420> said<00:04:11.540> it's

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
forward to 2010 because like i said it's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.070 
forward to 2010 because like i said it's
simple<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.319> a<00:04:13.030> slow<00:04:14.030> build<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.600> know<00:04:14.720> try<00:04:15.020> to

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
simple just a slow build you know try to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.580 
simple just a slow build you know try to
come<00:04:15.890> into<00:04:16.040> california<00:04:16.790> not<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.290> very

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
come into california not it the very

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.920 
come into california not it the very
best<00:04:18.859> but<00:04:19.190> good<00:04:19.400> enough<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.760> win<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.180> then<00:04:20.780> and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
