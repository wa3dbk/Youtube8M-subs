 I did not write on the string manat 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.199
 then buy a tee on the inside in. 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.719
 all external people plug on 2 2 inches 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.929
 internal thread and drill hole 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 insert the rally from the inside 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:57.929
 up to 2 4 inches inside 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.870
 thread connector and here it turns out here 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:07.130
 3 4 external here 3 4 usb adapter my 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.170
 tee 3 4 inch internal thread

 Area 4 inches by 3 inches and April 3, and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.619
 external thread internal thread here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.590
 my balloon was in place 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.060
 this one is a block and drowned him and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.159
 It turned out such a micro balloon then 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.049
 adapter to metal pipe 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.180
 inch with 3 4 inches internal thread 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.540
 then the adapter on the semi-inch 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.649
 metal pipe 3 4 inch 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 external thread here are all the points told 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:52.850
 further what's inside it shot the crowd 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.850
 man you need about 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.830
 how to make here such a piston to find 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.610
 Such a pencil on glue from all likely 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.440
 there is a little cut off here cover and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.530
 one more same length return 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.840
 cut into growth later cover 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.400
 stick on some super 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.830
 second glue there on epoxy glue 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.130
 everything inside pick out the whole mechanism 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.230
 spiral retraction there then hammer here 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.690
 only paper who is so cold 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.500
 weld put and stick on top 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:33.040
 rubber from the camera or plastic or there 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.690
 the ball is normal well whom 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.270
 which fantasies enough for sticking 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.030
 his face was rubber very well 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.100
 offered Takimoto things that is there and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 so here go to metalplastic 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.390
 trumpet he gives such a performance 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.010
 the tank to speak low tube sticks out 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.900
 from there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 showed you from there she's here on my 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.440
 epoxy planted not unscrewed how much 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.770
 tried to unscrew not unscrew over there 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.770
 blood and it's very simple to poke it and 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.910
 the air does not go out 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:18.860
 all that will show here so tight here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.209
 sits here in the sewer rigidly sits here 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.209
 note corr parts 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:31.550
 he is connected very good pump bley 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:36.340
 here's her master with a gauge so 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.310
 Iâ€™m watching now Iâ€™m clicking 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:48.230
 here the valve goes right away and you 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:52.630
 leaves moving apart plus 3 floor already 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:57.400
 ready pneumatic damn really no 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.400
 shorter when pumping air 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.800
 piston pushed out of connector 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.720
 under pressure from the hole cards and 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.140
 it turns out the air does not even come out 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.680
 through was one bite will be true and 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.790
 already through 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.820
 through this one is not hermetic and pathetic 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.350
 not logical the same piston sits bones not 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.440
 sealed and the air streaks are already 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.050
 passes here will be a balloon and 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.950
 stays here further after clicking 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.700
 on the screen or on the gun here 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.440
 opened the screen the air goes out 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.330
 sucks piston after opens here 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.300
 holes and all the air comes out of here 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:48.460
 it is very easy for you to go there 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.640
 but damn details expensive it all bought on 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.640
 1200 rubles 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:05:01.940
 okay little things pumped up and but often 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.350
 I was just very siphon started 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:11.440
 form of causing especially pump or 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.440
 you came out a little 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.870
 in this cylinder you can pump up to 7 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.719
 atmospheres atmospheres heavy duty here 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.639
 very rarely was he big 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.639
 balloon and you can pump further atmosphere 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:52.520
 forgot the tap is closed now wait on 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:56.000
 put and pumped up now 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:02.710
 see for the entrance personally how to siphon 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.710
 oh aspar go 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.160
 then you come up with yourself here 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.090
 how to make the muzzle short long to interfere 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.560
 for hours if you want to do with tap 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.680
 the pen may be waiting for Valhalla 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.780
 just buy a corner like this 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.490
 press and the crane itself is no longer 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.170
 convenient, I think it will be more convenient for ships and 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:32.420
 a gun to stubborn condoms 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.020
 well everybody everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.020
 until
