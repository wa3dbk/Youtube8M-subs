I don't know about you but I'm tired of
every gaming PC looking exactly like the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:13.139
last one so today let's break out of
that box this is cyber powers Trinity

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.779
extreme a pc so odd-looking it could
pass for Star Trek movie problem or even

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.699
Jack Bauer's nuclear bomb briefcase

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.450
hardcore but it's no regular PC the
Trinity manages to take the thing that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.620
makes the pc better than everyone else
like the pcs use of industry standard

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.630
parts while still looking incredibly
exotic so why our industry standard

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.260
parts so important because when it's
time to do that upgrade you will

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.590
actually be able to get the part to do
it because those parts aren't

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.430
proprietary

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.210
the Trinity extreme doesn't need a ton
of upgrades on it it has a liquid-cooled

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:09.320
6 core Core i7 58 20k cpu geforce titan
x GPU x99 motherboard 250 gig SSD and a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.030
two terabyte hard drive and again the
amazing thing is these are all

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.979
off-the-shelf components despite them
being in their own compartments the CPU

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.170
for example is in this pot the GPU in
this pod and the hard drive and power

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.220
supply are in this pot if you decide in
three years to upgrade this motherboard

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.539
not a problem but the negatives this
sucker is heavy it's solid steel case

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.940
weighs almost 50 pounds and it heats up
a ton of des pays to you can get just as

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.030
much computer into a smaller space if
you go with a boring a square box but

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.649
that doesn't get you what you want a
truly unique looking pc and will have

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.610
your friends wondering if your James
Bond supervillain instead of their

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.299
friendly nerd

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.810
coo coo

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.080
Oh
