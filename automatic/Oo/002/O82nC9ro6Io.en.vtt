over the top of the bronchus just like
this

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.550 
this
this<00:01:50.480> is<00:01:50.540> really<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.870> first<00:01:51.110> time<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.410> think

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
this is really the first time I think

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.880 
this is really the first time I think
it's<00:01:51.860> been<00:01:52.040> used<00:01:52.510> on<00:01:53.510> an<00:01:53.810> emergency<00:01:54.020> basis

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
it's been used on an emergency basis

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.410 
it's been used on an emergency basis
where<00:01:55.070> there<00:01:55.190> was<00:01:55.310> no<00:01:55.550> other<00:01:55.880> treatment

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.419 
information we designed into the device
essentially<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> geometry<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> device

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
essentially the geometry of the device

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.530 
essentially the geometry of the device
etc<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.660> it's<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.140> biopolymer<00:02:12.680> essentially<00:02:13.460> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
etc so it's a biopolymer essentially a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.630 
etc so it's a biopolymer essentially a
plastic<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:15.230> biocompatible<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.490> can

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
plastic that's biocompatible and you can

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.790 
plastic that's biocompatible and you can
use<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.060> body<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.690> resorbs<00:02:18.530> over

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
use it in the body and it resorbs over

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.540 
use it in the body and it resorbs over
time<00:02:19.360> Kaiba<00:02:20.360> was<00:02:20.930> brought<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.980> operating

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
time Kaiba was brought to the operating

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.270 
time Kaiba was brought to the operating
room<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.180> splint<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:24.290> placed<00:02:24.740> over<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> top

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
room the splint was placed over the top

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.270 
room the splint was placed over the top
of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> bronchus<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.690> has<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.560> process<00:02:28.040> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
of the bronchus this has the process of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.449 
of the bronchus this has the process of
opening<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.300> bronchus<00:02:29.720> up<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.220> Charlie<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
opening the bronchus up and Charlie and

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.490 
opening the bronchus up and Charlie and
posterior<00:02:31.940> lead<00:02:32.180> completely<00:02:32.900> widened<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
posterior lead completely widened the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.570 
posterior lead completely widened the
bronchus<00:02:34.010> who<00:02:34.670> was<00:02:34.820> amazing<00:02:35.450> as<00:02:35.600> soon<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
bronchus who was amazing as soon as the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.000 
bronchus who was amazing as soon as the
splint<00:02:37.970> was<00:02:38.150> put<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.170> lung<00:02:39.350> started<00:02:39.770> going

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
splint was put in the lung started going

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.610 
splint was put in the lung started going
up<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.370> down<00:02:40.550> for<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> first<00:02:41.450> time<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.470> knew

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
up and down for the first time we knew

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.979 
up and down for the first time we knew
that<00:02:42.770> he<00:02:42.920> would<00:02:43.040> be<00:02:43.070> okay

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.920 

means<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.739> means<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.310> world<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.700> me<00:02:47.930> just

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
means it means the world to me just

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.750 
means it means the world to me just
knowing<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.349> something<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.250> worked

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
knowing that something actually worked

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.539
