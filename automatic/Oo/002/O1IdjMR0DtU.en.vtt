00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 plus 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.060
 the day re-emerged within the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.220
 smartphone market and it's known that 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 in emerging markets those that reign 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.470
 are smartphones with specifications 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.760
 decent techniques at reduced prices is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.790
 why the South Korean manufacturer 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.090
 decided to launch the series last year 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.239
 composed of three devices the e3 l 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.340
 7 and 5 smartphones that went very well 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.770
 received at least in the market 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.930
 Latino and this time we have the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 new version of the family the lg 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.960
 optimus l 5x member of the family l 2 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.329
 this smartphone is laser cut 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.370
 to get very sharp angles and 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.110
 the volume buttons and the quick button 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.150
 they are located in the part 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.860
 left while the button 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.009
 On is in the part 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.990
 top next to the headphone jack 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.020
 finally at the bottom there is a 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.969
 microusb entry 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.000
 the display is 4 inches with 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.159
 800 resolution with 180 that looks 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 pretty good and by including technology 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 ips give us better angles of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850
 vision in addition to having a good 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 outdoor lighting this screen 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.259
 It is a multitouch capacitive type of two 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.539
 dots and incorporates corning gorilla glass 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.260
 what gives an added resistance 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.650
 to device 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.570
 and chose Android 4.1.2 as a system 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.280
 operative and the truth is that few 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.720
 manufacturers have the courage to include 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.050
 the latest version of android in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.520
 mid-range or low-end devices 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.530
 Android gaming integrates google now 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 project water improvements to the use of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.390
 single battery interface controller 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.300
 of 3g data consumption among others 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.490
 improvements the customization layer of it 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.470
 and honestly those heights stay 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.510
 something short since sometimes it 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.850
 they feel small crashes as if they 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.340
 move some work cost plus 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.990
 of whom is a good renewed visual what 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.760
 that is very grateful is that the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.280
 updates are made in a way 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.690
 Wireless is via ota so 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.220
 we will forget to connect the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.270
 computer 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.790
 internally we have the processor 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.030
 mediatek of one giga hertz and 512 mb 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.489
 they bleed what stays something down 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200
 let's say the mid-range that ultimately 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.360
 generations at least incorporate 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.670
 dual-core processors and 1 gb in 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.739
 ram for better performance in addition 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.450
 sincerely mediatek is not a 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.670
 processor manufacturer with great vÃ­a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.470
 the name we do not know his decision 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.140
 and having incorporated this processor 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.519
 for the team instead of a qualcomm that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.379
 it is found in fact in the rest of 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.230
 smartphones from the optimus series 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.940
 this will not prevent a user from using the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.459
 equipment for most tasks and 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.599
 applications we also have gps 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.510
 bluetooth 3.0 wifi and wifi function 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.209
 hotspots in the gaming section the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.370
 optimus the 5x is capable of most 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.069
 video games the processor and its chip 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.049
 Adreno 200 functions without major problem 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.579
 but the gaming experience might not 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.840
 be satisfactory for all 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.120
 users 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.519
 the camera is 5 megapixels with flash 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.800
 led the obtained photographs have 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.750
 passable quality and the flash works 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.430
 right way but it's not that powerful 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.319
 such as mid-range computers 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.390
 the options of the camera are very 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.700
 basic with just a few modes of 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.819
 available capture and some controls 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.280
 essentials like zoom white balance 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.980
 exposure control and perhaps the greatest 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.319
 Novelty in the l 5x is the voice control 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.269
 for capturing photography something that 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.460
 usually we would only find in 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.160
 high-end equipment 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.190
 the team has 4 GB of memory 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.300
 internal and its memory is expandable with 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.670
 micro SD up to 32 gigabytes in terms 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.710
 to the additional software the l 5x includes 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 Quick memo to create notes quickly 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.240
 on the screen anywhere 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.280
 the interface and the application of 6 kicker 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.960
 which is a service to notify 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 by SMS to your family or friends 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.730
 when you need help diverting 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.290
 calls on east location 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.540
 device includes an access button 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.420
 fast that is configurable to use 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.880
 quick memo sms web page start the 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.370
 camera and other functions not all 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.840
 good nice and cheap the truth is that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.820
 the design of the feeling at first 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.520
 seen that we are in front of a smartphone 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.500
 of medium-high range when really it 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.810
 falls short in several aspects about 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.160
 everything in your processor definitely 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.620
 slow down the group when starting to 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.390
 work on the other hand ram memory is 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.160
 something that is dated needs of the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.160
 today's applications and the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.689
 web experience is passable the guide has 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.939
 learned 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.459
 and what users demand without 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.529
 doubt this equipment will be sold 

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:53.869
 in Mexico with Telcel since it offers us 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.119
 a 4 inch screen ideal for 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:58.600
 a web gaming and multimedia experience 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.880
 much more than adequate 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.460
 this device is already 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.650
 available in Mexican territory in that 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.810
 moment only with telcel although 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.170
 probably also reach others 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.170
 operators
