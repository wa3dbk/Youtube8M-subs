 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.780
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.140
 film about the dji phantom 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.750
 no no completely wrong this time 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.449
 it's about something completely different I want to be with 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 join the next level together 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.999
 tread and me myself from now on 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 to assemble a copter 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:33.100
 You know I met five months ago 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.040
 like the phantom quadrocopter 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.960
 bought because he was easy because you got him 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.970
 could pack from battery could load 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 screwed propeller to it and then could 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.080
 you almost fly directly jupa 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.660
 easy for me as a beginner 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.640
 newcomers now are some months in the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.400
 Land pulled over 40 movies I have to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.520
 dji phantom quadrocopter made i am 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.650
 from the sprinkler at the absolute beginner yes 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.690
 even from my own knowledge 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.370
 one step further and I want to 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.410
 now with you here on my 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.269
 youtube channel the next level 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.670
 describe to me a head there myself 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.500
 I chose to work together 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.119
 so it will not be too difficult for you 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.579
 me the dtf 450 that is one 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.310
 quadrocopter as well as the phantom too 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.189
 and he also uses almost identical ones 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.299
 hardware and software 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.890
 Of course you have to enter here 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.689
 a little bit more about other things 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.420
 take care of details take care of ourselves 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.310
 assemble yourself screw yourself 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.569
 You also have to solder in the transmitter 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 configure and remote control 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.829
 buy for it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.689
 and yes I want everything with you 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.679
 do together in my new series 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:44.259
 about the ttf 450 so that's all 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.090
 I think mine works smoothly 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.569
 sponsor brought in the boat 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.609
 a company the company sander tiger europe 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.740
 this is not a retailer so you 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.909
 can not buy products there themselves 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.880
 but a wholesaler of the model flight 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.880
 and modellbau specialist shops 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.069
 They are here as a general sponsor 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.540
 Helping more helps me with that 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.630
 wheel 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.600
 did and yes I hope that's us 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.910
 work together with yours 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.640
 Help me hope you are back with me 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.220
 and now I pack this was this 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 first part of the f 450 playmobil the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.250
 is the pack so it looks and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.250
 now unpack at the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.150
 yes , the whole thing looks like this 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.340
 carton dji hobby is playmobil on it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.760
 450 elegant elegant very well exactly mine 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.820
 style motor frame can be seen on here 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.960
 and the first thing we have here 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.990
 this is a user manual that lard 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.950
 helpful here you can see everything with everything 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.870
 in the box is yes and how it 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.730
 should look after when it is ready 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.340
 very good ok but of course rather thin 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.660
 the whole thing we have here as 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.980
 Next are the motors we will do 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:28.040
 that's how four out of four look like 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:34.840
 it would have to be dji in big that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.840
 one more we are the other two 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.190
 and the last, after all, these are the ones 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.610
 four engines then we can at least 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.760
 Hopefully soon so take off 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.910
 we have here 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.830
 matching the engines the engine 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.600
 controllers look like that out two times 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.110
 here once stream and here once the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.299
 control and here then the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.140
 engines I guess times plugged 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.480
 there would have to be two of them, yes 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.790
 that's the other two 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.040
 By the way, the same is true 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.960
 also the dsi phantom constructed 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.880
 who has not seen it yet 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.390
 there according to my video 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.340
 yes then we have here this is the 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.450
 boom that would have to cut open the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.450
 is not here to rip 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.620
 but should take a big scissors 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:58.530
 no it works so are two pieces in 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.530
 red and two pieces in white 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 so then we have another 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.990
 screen with a bit of drama 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:15.130
 burn the usual here 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 two wrench cable it here 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.520
 still in there 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.350
 I think this is for the battery 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.500
 to attach the battery afterwards and 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:29.470
 Climbing wall also to attach to 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.590
 Example of the engines or the like 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.669
 clean up a bit here's how it continues 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:40.510
 next have a little bag here 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.410
 with a lot of screw with yes that 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.310
 Torx screws are Romans and that 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.520
 Next thing we have here is that 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:06:00.820
 Mainboard can also be careful here 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:03.669
 out ok once and twice that's one 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.360
 the bottom here you see the whole 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.340
 LÃ¶ points for the engines and here the 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.310
 Battery connection and this is the 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.280
 top then the top afterwards 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.490
 I think I have something like that 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.550
 still there a package 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.000
 here we have even more screw that 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.410
 are a little smaller with talks 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.690
 and then we have propellers here 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.710
 These are once as similar problems as 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.440
 they are also at the phantom four 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.479
 turning left and 4 right two left 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.840
 urgent though right-handed and here 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.669
 I have two additional ones 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.419
 are a bit bigger 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:51.539
 that's a lot bigger, I guess 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.449
 that here are these eight inches and 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:58.729
 this is 10 inches 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:01.770
 at least it says p8 and pc 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:05.190
 which one of them is later installed 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.880
 little bit dependent on the tension 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.039
 You can tell if we have to but 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.580
 that would be together then clarify yes 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:20.430
 that was it first of me to unboxing 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.599
 the Playmobil 450 of dji we will 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.520
 now together in the next time 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.419
 build and of course by the 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.419
 fly air
