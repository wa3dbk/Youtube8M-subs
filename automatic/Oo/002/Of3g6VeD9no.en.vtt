I have of cold water and I'm harvesting
spinach

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.700 

and<00:01:11.939> basically<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> see<00:01:12.899> here<00:01:13.289> is<00:01:13.469> what

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and basically what you see here is what

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
and basically what you see here is what
I<00:01:13.740> call<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> shark<00:01:14.369> bed<00:01:14.609> it's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.030> 25<00:01:15.600> feet<00:01:15.840> long

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I call a shark bed it's not 25 feet long

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
I call a shark bed it's not 25 feet long
this<00:01:16.259> bed<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.619> about<00:01:16.829> 12<00:01:17.159> feet<00:01:17.340> long<00:01:17.399> so<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this bed is about 12 feet long so in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.870 
this bed is about 12 feet long so in
certain<00:01:18.090> contexts<00:01:19.039> shark<00:01:20.039> beds<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.700> work

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
certain contexts shark beds can work

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
certain contexts shark beds can work
very<00:01:21.179> well<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> basically

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
very well so we're going to basically

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
very well so we're going to basically
finish<00:01:22.979> harvesting<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:23.969> going

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
finish harvesting here and we're going

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
finish harvesting here and we're going
to<00:01:24.149> weigh<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.259> get

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to weigh this out to see where we get

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.399 
to weigh this out to see where we get
per<00:01:25.979> short<00:01:26.520> bed<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.600> bed<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.990> two<00:01:28.200> feet

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
per short bed it's a bed about two feet

00:01:28.409 --> 00:02:38.930 
per short bed it's a bed about two feet
wide<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.950> 12<00:01:29.219> feet<00:01:29.429> long

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.930 

ah<00:02:39.620> just<00:02:40.620> took<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.980> spinach<00:02:41.580> out<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ah just took the spinach out of the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.310 
ah just took the spinach out of the
cooler<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.450> air<00:02:42.750> dried<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:44.040> bit<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.320> leaves

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
cooler it air dried for a bit and leaves

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.930 
cooler it air dried for a bit and leaves
have<00:02:46.530> dried<00:02:46.800> off<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> bit<00:02:47.310> there's<00:02:47.520> still<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> bit

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
have dried off a bit there's still a bit

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940 
have dried off a bit there's still a bit
damp<00:02:48.210> but<00:02:48.300> since<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.080> gonna<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.650> market

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
damp but since it's gonna be for market

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.260 
damp but since it's gonna be for market
sales<00:02:50.190> tomorrow<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.820> doesn't<00:02:51.090> really

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
sales tomorrow that doesn't really

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.300 
sales tomorrow that doesn't really
matter<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.590> we're<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> put<00:02:53.190> on

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
matter so we're just going to put on

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.820 
matter so we're just going to put on
basically<00:02:53.670> about<00:02:54.030> I'd<00:02:54.990> say<00:02:55.050> about<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.440> tenth<00:02:55.740> of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
basically about I'd say about a tenth of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.590 
basically about I'd say about a tenth of
a<00:02:55.920> pound<00:02:56.130> looks<00:02:56.670> reasonable<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.420> bag

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
a pound looks reasonable in a bag

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.570 
a pound looks reasonable in a bag
considering<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.350> baby<00:02:58.980> spinach<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.490> we're

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
considering that's baby spinach so we're

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.630 
considering that's baby spinach so we're
going<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.730> go<00:02:59.880> with<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.060> tenth<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.450> pound
