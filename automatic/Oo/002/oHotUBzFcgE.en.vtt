00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pulls off pull it off get it out of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.090 
pulls off pull it off get it out of the
way<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.559> you've<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
way and then you have a you've got this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
way and then you have a you've got this
dealy-bob<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> dealy-bob<00:00:55.289> are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
dealy-bob right here and dealy-bob are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.990 
dealy-bob right here and dealy-bob are
here<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> needs<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:56.340> removed<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
here that needs to be removed there's a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.380 
here that needs to be removed there's a
nut<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:58.500> take<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.980> nut<00:00:59.250> off<00:00:59.390> then

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
nut there well take that nut off then

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
nut there well take that nut off then
the<00:01:00.570> next<00:01:00.840> step<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> take<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> caliper

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the next step will be to take a caliper

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.420 
the next step will be to take a caliper
off<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.960> attached<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.739> bolts<00:01:05.159> back

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
off and that's attached by bolts back

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.649 
off and that's attached by bolts back
here<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.659> we'll

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here so we're going to do that and we'll

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
here so we're going to do that and we'll
get<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
get right back with you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
get right back with you
holily<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.080> got<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> clip<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.729> right

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
holily so we got that clip off right

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.050 
holily so we got that clip off right
here<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.580> that's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.820> 5/8<00:01:18.540> inch<00:01:18.650> bolt<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
here and that's a 5/8 inch bolt that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
here and that's a 5/8 inch bolt that
ult's<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.930> into<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.560> brake

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
ult's right down here into the brake

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
ult's right down here into the brake
caliper<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:26.340> mistake<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.479> would<00:01:27.689> make

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
caliper and then a mistake I would make

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
caliper and then a mistake I would make
if<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.040> didn't<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.430> any<00:01:29.610> better<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.240> take

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
if I didn't know any better I would take

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.830 
if I didn't know any better I would take
off<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.350> bolts<00:01:31.860> off<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> caliper<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
off these bolts off the caliper but you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.270 
off these bolts off the caliper but you
really<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.229> need<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
really don't need to do that you can

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.870 
really don't need to do that you can
just<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.780> big<00:01:37.110> bolts<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.460> into

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
just take the two big bolts that go into

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.370 
just take the two big bolts that go into
the<00:01:39.890> go<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> brake<00:01:43.490> bracket<00:01:44.490> right<00:01:45.299> here

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the go into the brake bracket right here

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
the go into the brake bracket right here
take<00:01:46.380> those<00:01:46.619> bolts<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.250> there's<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.640> right

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
take those bolts off there's one right

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480 
take those bolts off there's one right
up<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:50.189> down<00:01:50.460> here

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
up here and then there's one down here

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.020 
up here and then there's one down here
and<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> take<00:01:53.070> those<00:01:53.280> off<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.880> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and you take those off and then this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.789 
and you take those off and then this
whole<00:01:54.270> assembly<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.920> come<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.909> way

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
whole assembly will come out of the way

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.399 
whole assembly will come out of the way
one<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> those<00:01:59.009> bolts<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.869> bracket

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
one of those bolts on that bracket

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.880 
one of those bolts on that bracket
assembly<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> fifteen<00:02:03.000> sixteenths<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
assembly is a fifteen sixteenths and the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.130 
assembly is a fifteen sixteenths and the
other<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:07.550> 13/16<00:02:08.569> so

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
other one is a 13/16 so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.810 
other one is a 13/16 so
that's<00:02:12.140> what<00:02:12.380> those<00:02:12.560> are<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.070> then<00:02:13.100> none<00:02:13.790> of

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's what those are and then none of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.780 
that's what those are and then none of
what<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.180> could<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.780> could<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
what you could do is you could just

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.220 
what you could do is you could just
support<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:17.510> hanging<00:02:17.810> by<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
support that so it's not hanging by the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.010 
support that so it's not hanging by the
hose<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.390> hang<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.720> out<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.960> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
hose and just kind of hang it out of the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.590 
hose and just kind of hang it out of the
way<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.520> next<00:02:22.820> thing<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.450> you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
way then the next thing you do is you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.690 
way then the next thing you do is you
can<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:24.110> ahead<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.470> pull<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.070> rotor

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
can just go ahead and pull this rotor

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.920 
can just go ahead and pull this rotor
off<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:28.270> put<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.510> out<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
off like this and put that out of the
