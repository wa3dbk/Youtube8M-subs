00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.840
 firmware tre.zero 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.180
 developers 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.410
 digital forum 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.269
 we installed it on our aifon to preview which ones are 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.789
 new yahoo at least a large part 1 ita that we will see 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640
 equip ours too 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 to the fund with June 17th when the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.800
 dandy three.zero firmware download for aifon 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.040
 3 geeks 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.699
 real men we see immediately the big news are on the hill e 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.410
 by setting 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.690
 settings change in the general network and see how this appears 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.920
 from the menu 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 which allows you to share the internet connection then use 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.900
 the phone as a modem 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.300
 usb starts up 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.399
 via boh. 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.880
 we decide which of the two methods 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.620
 and by connecting the phone to the computer this will see it as a network drive 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.950
 so we will share 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.590
 our connection in this case vodafone 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 count the pc so this feature that was requested in a loud voice by the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.280
 Arconate user community implemented attention but not all 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.530
 the operators will support the fact that he has tried to be a card 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.760
 in the font and menu 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 liberty teringat is hidden so some h3g operator is not possible 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.219
 share the 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.059
 you have this also with wind but only with the operators who 

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:44.650
 officially revenge with pd tim 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.660
 vodafone 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.960
 back in the read the rooms we remain under the lens because 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 I'll show you how 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.900
 there is the possibility of 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.619
 rooms to sail with lioness then 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.730
 let's say that 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.539
 with 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.549
 vodafone the possibility eh already intrinsic because there is no 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.909
 possibility to set the network idatid manually, but we have our own 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.979
 made to not inserted a sim of h3g 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.350
 mns 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.230
 an interesting function is the one scrolling left with 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.650
 the menu to go and do a search on the whole abbot 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.940
 no phone software so if you have a text string 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.749
 for example 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.219

 and include VAT 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.889
 then the local string 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.369

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:08.089
 not even local nemo calais app made very well interesting you see it 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.279
 we have a 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.889
 wwwmeteo 10 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.419
 sign in 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.899
 and the quality of the list. the volume of the audio we are recording 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.690
 one time 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.030
 hahaha registered we can safely send our memo illy 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.079

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.770

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.679
 landini 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:38.510
 and therefore 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.360
 almici allows this to be requested as an audio attachment 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.300
 our minimal other channel sink of his life and the file via valfonda 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.120
 overdose 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.070
 we lose it we can search our phone through the gps 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.770
 but this is possible to know if it is possible that an accaunt mobail us 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.260
 therefore we do not have this function 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.310
 now on we can 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.629
 kraun see 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.910
 we have a 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.989
 copy paste evolved 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.899
 ohoh I'll show you for example we received one 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.039

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.139
 select all and copy 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.020
 we can then go back up 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.289
 safari for example 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.900
 see we have already done this 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 however we can paste in the page 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.759
 mt-10 affects the tracking number present which 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
 we received via kennedy 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.639
 go and glue it by simply holding the finger 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.039
 on the 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.389
 on the lucio space to write we write and paste for here that the 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.039
 Our tracking number is pasted so a copy paste that 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.120
 it works 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.059
 really good 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.309

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.339
 with digital revolution with 3g s 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.789
 sign these days we have really seen everyone 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.400
 to go wild on this new icon grand hotel but new innovations are 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.809
 only supported by a2a 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.669
 merits 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.630
 he picks up very early 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.670
 for the complete test of with 3gs when it will come 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.150
 to the presented 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.070
