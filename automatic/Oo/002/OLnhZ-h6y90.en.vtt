it<00:02:22.739> really<00:02:22.980> does<00:02:23.370> Drive<00:02:23.700> well<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.930> steers<00:02:25.319> well

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it really does Drive well as steers well

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.680 
it really does Drive well as steers well
but<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.370> must<00:02:26.640> admit<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.910> don't<00:02:27.060> feel<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.540> I'm

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
but I must admit I don't feel like I'm

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.890 
but I must admit I don't feel like I'm
connecting<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.940> road<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.450> feel<00:02:30.629> like<00:02:30.780> I'm

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
connecting with the road I feel like I'm

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.750 
connecting with the road I feel like I'm
connecting<00:02:31.319> with<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> power<00:02:31.769> steering<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.639> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
connecting with the power steering but I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400 
connecting with the power steering but I
mean<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.030> isn't<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.359> sports<00:02:33.630> car<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.200> maybe

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
mean this isn't a sports car so maybe

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.830 
mean this isn't a sports car so maybe
that's<00:02:34.650> probably<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:36.260> small<00:02:37.260> price<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.590> pay

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that's probably a small price to pay

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.010 
that's probably a small price to pay
the<00:02:40.410> car<00:02:41.310> does<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> lot<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.239> vault<00:02:42.630> sense

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the car does have a lot of vault sense

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.199 
the car does have a lot of vault sense
to<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.770> feel<00:02:43.890> Anissa<00:02:44.550> tires<00:02:44.790> from<00:02:45.090> the
