00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
diamond gold very nice believe that is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.200 
diamond gold very nice believe that is
iron<00:02:54.390> yeah<00:02:54.960> iron<00:02:56.120> coal<00:02:57.710> lapis<00:02:58.710> lazuli<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.550> red

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
iron yeah iron coal lapis lazuli and red

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.740 
iron yeah iron coal lapis lazuli and red
stone<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.490> water<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.090> water<00:03:03.420> looks

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
stone for the water the water looks

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.260 
stone for the water the water looks
really<00:03:04.050> nice<00:03:04.170> doesn't<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.030> look<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
really nice doesn't it look at that

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.920 
really nice doesn't it look at that
movement<00:03:06.740> very<00:03:07.740> luxurious<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> lava

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
movement very luxurious and the lava

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.510 
movement very luxurious and the lava
that<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.590> fits<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> well<00:03:10.980> because<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
that really fits it well because you

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.400 
that really fits it well because you
know<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.790> mountain<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.360> seen<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> Lord

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
know the mountain if you seen the Lord

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.070 
know the mountain if you seen the Lord
of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> Rings<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:14.220> makes<00:03:14.490> sense

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
of the Rings it makes sense

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.510 
of the Rings it makes sense
that's<00:03:16.080> what<00:03:16.440> lava<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.950> look<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
that's what lava would look like and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.390 
that's what lava would look like and
netherrack<00:03:18.090> look<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:19.950> very

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
netherrack look at that that is very

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.960 
netherrack look at that that is very
well<00:03:20.670> done<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.520> on<00:03:23.670> over

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
well done and what is going on over

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.430 
well done and what is going on over
there<00:03:24.950> what<00:03:25.950> are<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.100> doing<00:03:26.130> full<00:03:26.550> oh<00:03:27.440> let's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
there what are you doing full oh let's

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.250 
there what are you doing full oh let's
have<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.650> look<00:03:28.800> at<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:30.360> put<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260

villager and he's an orc
so<00:03:34.800> there's<00:03:35.160> another<00:03:35.370> texture<00:03:35.700> pack<00:03:35.940> thing

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
so there's another texture pack thing

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.850 
so there's another texture pack thing
work<00:03:37.170> it's<00:03:37.860> very<00:03:38.040> nice<00:03:39.470> let's<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.620> back<00:03:40.740> over

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
does stuffy throat um whatever that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.570 
does stuffy throat um whatever that
means<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.760> can't<00:03:50.760> clear<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.709> overall<00:03:53.160> I

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
means I can't clear it so overall I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.030 
means I can't clear it so overall I
would<00:03:53.940> give<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:55.440> really<00:03:55.680> close<00:03:55.860> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
would give this it's really close I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.350 
would give this it's really close I
think<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.370> would<00:03:56.459> give<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.730> 10<00:03:56.910> out<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.090> 10<00:03:57.209> I

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
think I would give it a 10 out of 10 I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.660 
think I would give it a 10 out of 10 I
don't<00:03:57.630> see<00:03:57.750> any<00:03:57.959> Falls<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.520> looks

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
don't see any Falls and this it looks

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.960 
don't see any Falls and this it looks
really<00:04:00.030> nice<00:04:00.890> I'll<00:04:01.890> probably<00:04:02.190> maybe<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
video later of me actually in a world

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.090 
video later of me actually in a world

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
this could be my primary texture pack to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.570 
this could be my primary texture pack to
use<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.040> mean<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.340> awesome<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:16.709> know
