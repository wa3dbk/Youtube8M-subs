00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
asked me to cover this weapon in the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.959 
asked me to cover this weapon in the
past<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.040> didn't<00:00:14.580> really<00:00:14.639> see<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
past and I just didn't really see the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.129 
past and I just didn't really see the
point<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.540> because<00:00:15.809> he<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:15.990> just

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
point of it because he was just

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.800 
point of it because he was just
overshadowed<00:00:16.980> by<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.490> many<00:00:17.670> weapons<00:00:17.850> not

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
overshadowed by so many weapons not

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.439 
overshadowed by so many weapons not
including<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.529> prime<00:00:19.910> primary<00:00:20.910> weapons<00:00:21.240> but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
including just prime primary weapons but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
including just prime primary weapons but
pretty<00:00:22.350> much<00:00:22.410> everything<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.400> let's<00:00:23.460> take<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
pretty much everything so let's take a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
pretty much everything so let's take a
look<00:00:23.850> at<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> changes<00:00:24.210> though<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.170> first

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
look at the changes though the first

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.750 
look at the changes though the first
thing<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> physical<00:00:26.189> damage<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
thing is that the physical damage on the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.210 
thing is that the physical damage on the
weapon<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.210> bumped<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.810> 25<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.320> 35<00:00:28.920> which

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
weapon got bumped up from 25 to 35 which

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.659 
weapon got bumped up from 25 to 35 which
is<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.670> 20<00:00:29.910> below<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.109> bolter<00:00:31.500> Prime<00:00:31.830> except

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is just 20 below the bolter Prime except

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.459 
is just 20 below the bolter Prime except
this<00:00:32.790> weapon<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> still<00:00:33.420> focused<00:00:33.780> mainly<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
this weapon is still focused mainly in

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
this weapon is still focused mainly in
to<00:00:34.559> slash<00:00:34.770> damage<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> also<00:00:36.329> has<00:00:36.690> some

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to slash damage but it also has some

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
to slash damage but it also has some
puncture<00:00:37.710> damage<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:38.910> be

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
puncture damage as well so it can be

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
puncture damage as well so it can be
decent<00:00:39.420> against<00:00:39.750> infested<00:00:40.260> targets<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
decent against infested targets but it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.900

actually nerfed down to 375 from 540 now
speaking<00:01:05.880> specifically<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.780> fire

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
speaking specifically about the fire

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.330 
speaking specifically about the fire
rate<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> weapon<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.799> did<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.040> bumped<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
rate on the weapon it did get bumped up

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.890 
rate on the weapon it did get bumped up
to<00:01:08.400> nine<00:01:08.670> point<00:01:08.880> six<00:01:09.180> which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.600> decent

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to nine point six which is a decent

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480 
to nine point six which is a decent
firing<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.470> its<00:01:10.619> own<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.920> feel<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.369> still

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
firing on its own but I feel it's still

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.920 
firing on its own but I feel it's still
a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.880> lacking<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> burst

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
a little bit lacking in the burst

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.300 
a little bit lacking in the burst
apartments<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> honestly<00:01:13.860> feel<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
apartments so I honestly feel that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
apartments so I honestly feel that
adding<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> shred<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.570> bump<00:01:15.750> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
adding in a shred to just bump that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
adding in a shred to just bump that
fiery<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.530> by<00:01:16.680> 30%<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.000> getting<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
fiery up by 30% as well as getting that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929 
fiery up by 30% as well as getting that
one<00:01:18.540> point<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.020> punch<00:01:19.650> through<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> really

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
one point to punch through is really

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
one point to punch through is really
nice<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> weapon<00:01:21.900> especially<00:01:22.080> when

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
nice on the weapon especially when

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
nice on the weapon especially when
dealing<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> bunch<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> infested<00:01:24.390> or

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
something like that you can also use a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
something like that you can also use a
vile<00:01:26.580> acceleration<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.810> to

to<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> single<00:01:32.070> target<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.549> again<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> thing<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to a single target but again a thing you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
to a single target but again a thing you
gotta<00:01:33.509> watch<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> fact<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
gotta watch out for now is the fact that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
gotta watch out for now is the fact that
that<00:01:35.189> ammo<00:01:35.400> cap<00:01:35.700> did<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.150> nerfed<00:01:36.390> down<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> 375

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that ammo cap did get nerfed down to 375

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
that ammo cap did get nerfed down to 375
so<00:01:38.009> although<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.790> won't<00:01:38.909> run<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.180> too<00:01:39.600> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so although you won't run into too much

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
so although you won't run into too much
ammo<00:01:39.960> problems<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.250> definitely

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
ammo problems with it it can definitely

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
ammo problems with it it can definitely
happen<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.360> constantly<00:01:42.600> holding<00:01:43.140> down

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
happen if you're constantly holding down

that switch kind of like that and you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.580 
that switch kind of like that and you

you<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.770> an<00:02:19.920> 18-point<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.819> fire<00:02:21.120> rate<00:02:21.300> which

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
you up to an 18-point to fire rate which

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.540 
you up to an 18-point to fire rate which
is<00:02:21.600> pretty<00:02:22.200> fun<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> mess<00:02:22.740> around<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.190> but

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
is pretty fun to mess around with but

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.850 
is pretty fun to mess around with but
that's<00:02:24.510> basically<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.930> personal<00:02:25.590> preference

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that's basically a personal preference

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.380 
that's basically a personal preference
thing<00:02:26.160> another<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:26.940> which<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.270> actually

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
thing another thing which I actually

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
thing another thing which I actually
didn't<00:02:27.660> point<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.959> yet<00:02:28.170> too<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.830> even

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
didn't point out yet too is that even

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.160 
didn't point out yet too is that even
though<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> crit<00:02:30.240> chance<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
crit damage multiplier I should say did

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.140 
crit damage multiplier I should say did
get<00:02:33.120> pump<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.660> 2.0<00:02:34.440> which<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:36.090> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
get pump up to a 2.0 which is what you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
get pump up to a 2.0 which is what you
would<00:02:36.300> want<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.660> crit<00:02:36.870> filled<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.590> that

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
would want for a crit filled with that

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.440 
would want for a crit filled with that
10%<00:02:37.920> crit<00:02:38.370> chance<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.820> only<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
10% crit chance you can only get up to a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.199 
10% crit chance you can only get up to a
25%<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.620> unfortunately<00:02:41.430> you're<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.090> not

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
25% so unfortunately you're not it's not

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.210 
25% so unfortunately you're not it's not
really<00:02:42.360> viable<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.959> build<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> crit<00:02:44.040> damage

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
really viable to build it crit damage

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.590 
really viable to build it crit damage
which<00:02:44.550> would<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.880> been<00:02:44.940> amazing<00:02:45.209> but

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
which would have been amazing but

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.320 
which would have been amazing but
whatever<00:02:45.900> having<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.709> bump<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.520> your<00:02:47.760> crit

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
whatever having a bump to your crit

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.180 
whatever having a bump to your crit
damage<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.750> always<00:02:49.050> nice<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.739> then<00:02:49.920> after

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
damage is always nice and then after

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
damage is always nice and then after
that<00:02:50.280> all<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.640> did<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.209> added<00:02:51.570> in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that all I really did is I just added in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
that all I really did is I just added in
dual<00:02:52.050> set<00:02:52.350> elements<00:02:52.590> because<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.550> four<00:02:53.850> on

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
dual set elements because with four on

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.550 
dual set elements because with four on
you<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.269> actually<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> weapon<00:02:55.019> up<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.350> 80

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
you can actually get the weapon up to 80

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.460 
you can actually get the weapon up to 80
8.5%<00:02:56.420> SAS<00:02:57.420> chance<00:02:57.780> when<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.019> factor<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.380> the

so for Grenier you want radiation and

poison<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> didn't<00:03:09.269> get<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.390> little<00:03:09.570> bit<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.810> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
poison so I didn't get a little bit of a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.949 
poison so I didn't get a little bit of a
drop<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.290> my<00:03:10.410> status<00:03:10.709> which<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.820> 79%<00:03:12.540> when

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
drop to my status which is that 79% when

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.270 
drop to my status which is that 79% when
you<00:03:13.050> drop<00:03:13.230> one<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.470> them<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:13.800> it's<00:03:13.920> worth<00:03:14.100> it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
you drop one of them but it's worth it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.949 
you drop one of them but it's worth it
because<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.700> toxic<00:03:15.090> goes<00:03:15.239> through<00:03:15.540> shields

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
because the toxic goes through shields

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.720 
because the toxic goes through shields
so<00:03:16.320> that's<00:03:16.440> always<00:03:16.650> best<00:03:16.950> against<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> corpus

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so that's always best against the corpus

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.840 
so that's always best against the corpus
and<00:03:17.850> then<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.840> our<00:03:19.079> actual<00:03:19.320> infested<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.340> did

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
and then for our actual infested I did

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.729 
and then for our actual infested I did
kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.360> with<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> bane<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.260> infested

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
kind of go with a bane of the infested

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.990 
kind of go with a bane of the infested
to<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.160> kind<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.489> some<00:03:23.610> more<00:03:23.730> top-end

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
to just kind of get some more top-end

knockdown this is a personal preference
thing<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.799> would<00:03:37.920> experiment<00:03:38.220> with<00:03:38.430> both<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
thing I would experiment with both and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.850 
thing I would experiment with both and
see<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.299> works<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.900> for<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.410> voids<00:03:40.620> oh

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
see what works for you for the voids oh

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.380 
see what works for you for the voids oh
it's<00:03:41.130> as<00:03:41.310> simple<00:03:41.489> as<00:03:41.820> basically<00:03:42.239> just

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
it's as simple as basically just

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.420 
it's as simple as basically just
switching<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.930> bane<00:03:43.140> mod<00:03:43.380> though<00:03:43.590> for<00:03:44.250> an

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
switching of that bane mod though for an

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.830 
switching of that bane mod though for an
infected<00:03:44.880> clip<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:45.390> will<00:03:45.540> give<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.780> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
infected clip and this will give you a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
infected clip and this will give you a
more<00:03:46.230> corrosive<00:03:46.709> damage<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.280> still<00:03:47.489> want

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
more corrosive damage but you still want

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.979 
more corrosive damage but you still want
on<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.790> thermite<00:03:48.120> rounds<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.690> keep<00:03:48.840> your

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
on the thermite rounds just to keep your

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.009 
on the thermite rounds just to keep your
stats<00:03:49.230> at<00:03:49.440> 79%<00:03:49.890> plus<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.880> fear<00:03:51.510> from<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> fire

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
stats at 79% plus the fear from the fire

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.810 
stats at 79% plus the fear from the fire
effect<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.860> work<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.280> advantage<00:03:53.340> as

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
effect can work to your advantage as

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.699 
effect can work to your advantage as
well<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.360> something<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.170> lot<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.500> people

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
well as something that a lot of people

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.319 
well as something that a lot of people
don't<00:03:55.799> consider<00:03:56.160> overall<00:03:56.880> though<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> feel

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
don't consider overall though I feel

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.449 
don't consider overall though I feel
like<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.630> buff<00:03:57.870> was<00:03:58.560> pretty<00:03:58.920> nice<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
like this buff was pretty nice for the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.710 
like this buff was pretty nice for the
weapon<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.970> feel<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:00.540> definitely

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
weapon I feel like it's definitely

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.229 
weapon I feel like it's definitely
usable<00:04:01.440> now<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.980> doesn't<00:04:02.220> put<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.910> like

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
usable now it doesn't put it up in like

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.180 
usable now it doesn't put it up in like
the<00:04:03.360> top<00:04:03.570> tier<00:04:03.870> slot<00:04:04.200> with<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.860> voltar

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
the top tier slot with like the voltar

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.830 
the top tier slot with like the voltar
primes<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.790> sohma's<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.450> stuff<00:04:06.660> like

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
primes and the sohma's and stuff like

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.420 
primes and the sohma's and stuff like
that<00:04:07.110> but<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.799> fact<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.100> can<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.310> your

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
that but the fact you can get your

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.490 
that but the fact you can get your
status<00:04:08.850> especially<00:04:09.090> up<00:04:09.600> really<00:04:10.079> high<00:04:10.230> with

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
status especially up really high with

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.199 
status especially up really high with
that<00:04:10.530> nice<00:04:10.859> fire<00:04:11.130> rate<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.640> definitely<00:04:12.120> make

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
that nice fire rate can definitely make

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.330 
that nice fire rate can definitely make
it<00:04:12.269> viable<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.870> late-game<00:04:13.160> just<00:04:14.160> being

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
it viable for the late-game just being

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.979 
it viable for the late-game just being
able<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.489> proc<00:04:14.790> those<00:04:14.970> viral<00:04:15.450> procs<00:04:15.720> or

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
able to proc those viral procs or

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.810 
able to proc those viral procs or
corrosive<00:04:16.260> procs<00:04:16.650> against<00:04:16.919> armored<00:04:17.400> targets

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
corrosive procs against armored targets

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360 
corrosive procs against armored targets
so<00:04:18.269> overall<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.169> definitely<00:04:19.680> recommend<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.220> now

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
so overall I definitely recommend it now

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.070 
so overall I definitely recommend it now
and<00:04:20.669> I'm<00:04:21.180> actually<00:04:21.359> having<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> lot<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.900> fun

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
and I'm actually having a lot of fun

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.330 
and I'm actually having a lot of fun
with<00:04:22.229> it<00:04:22.320> myself<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.099> for<00:04:23.130> this

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
with it myself but that's it for this

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.980 
with it myself but that's it for this
