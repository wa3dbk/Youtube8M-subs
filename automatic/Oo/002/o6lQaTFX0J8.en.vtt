alright<00:00:00.690> guys<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> decided<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.949> take<00:00:02.129> off

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
alright guys so I decided to take off

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.410 
alright guys so I decided to take off
this<00:00:03.319> ignition<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.529> was<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.160> my<00:00:05.460> bike<00:00:05.790> stock

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
this ignition that was on my bike stock

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.200 
this ignition that was on my bike stock
because<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.529> simply<00:00:08.130> didn't<00:00:08.519> like<00:00:08.639> how<00:00:08.820> big<00:00:09.030> it

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
because I simply didn't like how big it

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.940 
because I simply didn't like how big it
was<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.780> don't<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> location<00:00:10.530> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
was and I don't like the location and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860 
was and I don't like the location and
most<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.849> time<00:00:12.059> when<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.360> trying<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.660> take

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
most of the time when I'm trying to take

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
most of the time when I'm trying to take
the<00:00:12.960> key<00:00:13.170> out<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.590> hit<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> exhaust<00:00:14.280> manifold<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the key out I hit the exhaust manifold I

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.529 
the key out I hit the exhaust manifold I
am<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.509> fingers<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.369> figured<00:00:18.119> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
am for my fingers off so I figured that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.370 
am for my fingers off so I figured that
I'll<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> solution<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:22.170> rid

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
I'll come up with a solution to get rid

I'll come up with a solution to get rid
of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.619> ignition<00:00:23.100> key<00:00:24.060> except<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.140> didn't<00:00:25.710> want

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
of the ignition key except I didn't want

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.830 
of the ignition key except I didn't want
to<00:00:26.220> completely<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:26.970> rid<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.660> that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

anybody can start the bike what I'm
gonna<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> wire<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.599> these<00:00:30.779> switches<00:00:31.349> these

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gonna do is wire up these switches these

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
gonna do is wire up these switches these
are<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.980> ways<00:00:32.160> switches<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
are the two ways switches in a way so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
much so this is the switch that I have

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
much so this is the switch that I have
here<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.270> gonna<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.630> installed<00:01:19.290> right

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
here and it's gonna be installed right

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.719 
here and it's gonna be installed right
here<00:01:20.700> under<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> pen<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.020> made<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.920> slits<00:01:23.369> with

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
here under the pen I made two slits with

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.420 
here under the pen I made two slits with
dremel<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:25.979> fit<00:01:26.189> right

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
dremel and this is just gonna fit right

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
dremel and this is just gonna fit right
in<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.810> holes<00:01:28.170> here

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
in here so I have the two holes here

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:40.859 
in here so I have the two holes here
line<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.640> up

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.779 

I'm<00:01:41.869> not<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> tease<00:01:42.530> out<00:01:42.770> with<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> hammer<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
I'm not a tease out with a hammer so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.330 
I'm not a tease out with a hammer so
that<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:45.680> doesn't<00:01:46.159> go<00:01:46.310> anywhere<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.890> reason

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
that it doesn't go anywhere the reason

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.800 
that it doesn't go anywhere the reason
why<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.670> decided<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.920> not<00:01:51.920> make<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:52.810> permanent

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
why I decided to not make it permanent

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.350 
why I decided to not make it permanent
permanent<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.799> because<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.700> figured<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.329> would

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
permanent is because I figured I would

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.899 
permanent is because I figured I would
want<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.869> change<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.229> combination<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:58.220> if<00:01:58.729> I

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
want to change the combination and if I

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.460 
want to change the combination and if I
do<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.179> need<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.509> walk<00:01:59.659> on<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.960> bike<00:02:00.170> down

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
do you need to walk on the bike down

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.010 
do you need to walk on the bike down
there<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.579> have<00:02:01.819> access<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.569> still

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
there I can have access to it still

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.380 
there I can have access to it still
without<00:02:03.439> cutting<00:02:03.799> any<00:02:04.009> metal<00:02:04.460> by<00:02:04.819> creating
