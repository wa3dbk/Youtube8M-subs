00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello to all and morgane 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 but we end up following the second 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.330
 stream made by bangui before the release 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 of the extension tekken king and this time 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 this time was interested in an assault in 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.510
 particular that allowed us to see 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.859
 also the doctrines in action so 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.810
 if you do not wish to be spoiled 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.970
 of course do not watch this video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 I will do others on different 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.849
 skills of ours in guk do you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 do not worry about it I had 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 by the way already made videos of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.890
 Preview what had Halo 3 you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 invites to go for a ride up in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 as long as I leave you the videos 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 definitive and so for those who remain 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 so we're going to have a little 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.789
 little bit of a glimpse of the sau so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 shield brothers is going on on 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.950
 saturate rings and so that is a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 assault facing the cabba lÃ© us that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.829
 level of sound quality I am 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 excuse in advance to 1 is going to be enough 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 catastrophic on this video since 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.329
 I am not in the same room as 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.050
 usually he records with the microphone 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 a mac 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 so it's really catastrophic and I 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.940
 apologize to me you 're going to have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 the impression of georgia in the hall of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 bath I think it's not the case I you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 reassure even if he will be very funny but 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 all is well I want in a real 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.810
 piece is so this assault he was 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.159
 commented by kyle 6 at least it's 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.840
 the person who gives me the mission you 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.580
 know for example in the house of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 wolves it was often by x that we 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.990
 were talking and so the ctec is here it's 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 an ample avant-garde of the hunters 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 for those who would not be so the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 sauce goes in the sled of a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.790
 battleship in French version 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 so we also have a great decor 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.369
 you'll see it in the excerpts that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 I will introduce you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.869
 and then it allowed us to see everything 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.520
 first the doctrines in action we could 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.049
 see just the three news 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 doctrines for the titan the organist and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.710
 hunters so that was pretty cool 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.570
 although of course we did not have any more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 the titan which in my opinion is a better 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 player present in the right team a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 since it was mister fleet a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 Monsieur frier version version 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 French francized and therefore control him 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.229
 time so we saw a lot 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.700
 time we saw a little more we saw 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.159
 also a little bit the arc to nice you so 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.320
 with his crio doctrine and then we do not have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.270
 many saw the hunter who in my opinion 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.280
 was just beginning on the game 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.319
 of course we could see of course the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.849
 new enemies we even saw at all 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.890
 start of the assault a kind of new 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.580
 kind of lookout the impression the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.200
 new weapons 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.300
 we could also see them in demonstration 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.879
 of course again we did not have the one 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.980
 of mr foot which was more put forward 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.840
 since he was playing better than his two 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.360
 comrades but hey that's good 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 since he had some kind of revolver 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.290
 in the hands pretty nice so revolver 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.549
 gun is not doing a drama on it 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.040
 maybe I was wrong 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.269
 do not worry too much about that in 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.560
 anyway it makes me laugh well these 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.370
 new weapons with their green design 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.930
 fluo 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.340
 it's nice I finally find when 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.920
 I saw the first time I had I was 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.540
 not of this opinion but ultimately it makes 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 not bad I saw also refuse a goal on 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.849
 the che precisely homologous naulleau mode 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.989
 I do not know who seems to me very very 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.299
 well I showed you subject 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.620
 incidentally to the impulse and then we saw 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.530
 also refused the merger 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.200
 we saw two snipers and we saw the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.000
 famous sword in action so thick that has 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.709
 served essentially appears suddenly 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.780
 since he used it at the end in the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.579
 boss fight and who by the way 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.310
 use ammunition since in the end 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.569
 the end 10 hours charge the shot after 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.290
 several parades where he said I am 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.100
 a marc simard 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.810
 you have no power in these places bah 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.730
 finally he got banged so he 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.230
 had pleased I think of charges for his 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.780
 sword to be able to correct the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.329
 shots we could also see at the beginning of the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 presentation the artifacts so there 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.930
 had 3 arte fans one per class 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 each of these artifacts actually been 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.760
 of some of a certain kind of 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.430
 so solar abyssal damage to the crillon 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.780
 and so the scrum kills performed on 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.540
 the henchmen of darkness first and foremost 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.579
 enemies of the pve finally with this 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.010
 equipped artifact had a chance of 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.959
 generate trees for allies so 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.980
 So, inevitably, they put according to 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.530
 different doctrines 1 for example 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.569
 titan had there the solar artifact of the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.769
 couple and so after we had seen that 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.510
 of these three I do not know if there is 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.040
 other artifacts that exist other 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.709
 operation but then he had 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
 does this trio there at the level of doctrines 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.560
 I think we also had a good overview 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.910
 so I do not know if it will show up in 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.470
 the phases of gameplay I showed you 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.450
 my boosts since a new 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.769
 doctrine really have one each time 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.470
 skills that boosts 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.400
 the allies in agility speed and that 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.410
 it was on the screen 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.120
 and then of course the titan I come back to 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.570
 assume the titan's super has appeared 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.890
 really 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.750
 op for me it's good whoever 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.130
 detached then of course is that it has 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.600
 not been skewed by the fact that this is the 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.120
 best player who controls the titan 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.650
 necessarily it has put it well but 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.900
 he looks really dropped 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.250
 and then at the boss level I am very 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.540
 happy because we find some 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.190
 thing I was expecting a lot less 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.960
 sure destiny and that there was no 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.790
 again it was a boss in 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
 several phases so that is to say that 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.330
 there we will have for example one in this 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.030
 case we had a boss data 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.160
 then his brother they are brothers 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.780
 and then a phase where they are 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.370
 both group together and in each 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.360
 of its faces in implementation of these phases 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.520
 really has patterns of attac 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.690
 different so each of the two boxes to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.830
 different patterns and when they 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630
 are together it's still different 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.130
 but that I find it really very very 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.880
 successful 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.930
 this thing and it's something 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.600
 which was missing that I was waiting a lot 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.130
 for my part and at the loot level 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.230
 they said they would also have 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.910
 exclusive stuff for every boss we 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.440
 kill so we'll see how far 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.900
 since that they do not have it 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.910
 exactly exactly is supposed to have 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.440
 something a little bit more dedicated 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.000
 and that gives a little more interest to 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.480
 to redo precisely is to 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.760
 those ones 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
 so here's for the preview a little bit of 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.870
 what is going to be what are going to be the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.490
 assaults in destiny's future one in 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.770
 the extension tekken king me it paid me 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.360
 very want to play this extension to 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.060
 it does not change a lot of people have me 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.560
 asked if i was going to stream and peking king 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.510
 cegereal via making videos is fine 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.740
 sure it sounds pretty obvious i'm going 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.900
 make streams make him videos 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.000
 of course I'm waiting for this extension with 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.830
 impatience so you can count on 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.330
 me to be at the rendezvous and suddenly 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.220
 we find ourselves in videos that you 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.840
 presents a little more detail 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.340
 doctrines that are now a 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.960
 revealed in full 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.250
 and so here we are very 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.300
 quickly on the chain and then back to school 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.300
 on the stream as always
