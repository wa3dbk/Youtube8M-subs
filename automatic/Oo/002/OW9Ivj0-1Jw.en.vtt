with android 2.3 I think Gingerbread and
has<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:41.140> 1.2<00:00:42.140> gigahertz<00:00:42.530> dual-core<00:00:45.070> dual-core

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core dual-core

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.569 
has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core dual-core
CPU

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
