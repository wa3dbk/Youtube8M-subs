00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:16.797
 We start by applying a foundation 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.340
 on the whole face, 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.117
 we also apply this 

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:20.257
 on the eyes. 

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:21.804
 For this look 

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.723
 we use the colors of the German flag. 

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:24.754
 With a black pencil 

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.077
 we define the eye socket 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.860
 and we fill the outer corner of the eye. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.360
 We spread black eye shadow over the rest of the eyelid 

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.344
 and create a black shadow effect. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.760
 Fade a little 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 and we continue with another color, 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.827
 the Red. 

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:36.952
 We fade again, 

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:38.594
 and apply white under the eyebrows, 

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:39.644
 and yellow, 

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.304
 the last color of the flag, 

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:43.483
 in the middle of the eyelid. 

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:45.480
 We repeat this for the other eye, 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.340
 and then apply black to the lower lash line, 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700
 and eyeliner. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.620
 We emphasize the eyebrows with dark brown eye shadow 

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:53.443
 to make them stand out better. 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.040
 Draw the outline of your lips with a red pencil, 

00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:58.534
 and use a burgundy lipstick. 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.620
 Apply yellow accents, 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260
 both on the upper and lower lip, 

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:04.407
 a pink blush, 

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.733
 fake eyelashes on the outer half of the eyelashes, 

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.281
 mascara on the rest of the eyelashes, 

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.599
 and we continue with the hair. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.680
 We comb the hair 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.220
 and make two simple braids, 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 one on each side. 

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:16.001
 But this Tyrolean look 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.159
 is of course not complete 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.960
 without 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 a fantastic costume from Funidelia. 

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:21.840
 There is also 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.660
 a super special male version. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 These costumes, 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.580
 the accessories 

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:29.764
 and much more, 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.700
