00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.099
 Hello dear spectator I am - from the team 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.230
 rocket we are back on the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.680
 land on the way and want to succeed 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 with the bed acceptable so yes I catch 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.650
 I'll ask you again and again 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.100
 how we do it, why we do it 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.830
 You can say the picture is very passive 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.210
 lead or actively take care of that is 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.699
 up to each himself as himself 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.430
 ties together and how we build that 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.699
 or more or less commercial 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.470
 I'll show you everything ok 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.040
 what you need for the work 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:04.050
 This is very important for carbon 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.050
 an equal red 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.020
 and one out of action 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 and different as well as me that one 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.650
 binds 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.820
 give yourself for low carbon 50 to 80 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.130
 centimeter 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.630
 that is pure matter of taste everyone 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.260
 do that a little bit different I suppose 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.040
 usually so 70 cm then you take as 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.920
 First of all, these are often days where you do it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.689
 Knot either a children's knot 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880
 or in rapala gooden that's one too 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.750
 pure matter of taste on the one 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.060
 others to Rome 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.799
 i prefer the kids easy and 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.799
 fast even at colder temperatures 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.330
 then really that 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.400
 I usually do five to eight 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.159
 development according to cord strength 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.159
 Mind you should be enough 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.090
 very important 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 a bit disgusting but not too 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 fear the first of the knots 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.150
 better together and no frictional heat 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.230
 on this blog arbon arises with it 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.230
 also no trace book arises 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.010
 very nice together 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.010
 will cut over constant easy off 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.210
 April 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.350
 better than with the pliers so you have 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.840
 ever a hook on the no-fly 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.080
 tasted 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.890
 this same red I grabbed my blog 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.320
 on monday in distance where i find this 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.780
 the same red affirmation that is 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.730
 a matter of taste 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.820
 or depending on the sinking of the body 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.510
 If I keep him in the front 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.250
 would make the apron 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.560
 how am I actually only at the plaza 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.860
 and the more I go backwards 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
 I have a long time with the meat 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.010
 that is, if the industry sinks 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.240
 maybe a little bitchy and are 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.190
 to lure them out of the reserve 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.440
 she is automatically further back 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.420
 get a slower predictable 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 and one or the other wears off yet 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.050
 it's still too much now 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 Even with the forceps is not so healthy 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.410
 low off 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.860
 what we use bait for 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.989
 that 's up to everyone but for 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:04:17.049
 us or was rich for me i had on 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:04:22.610
 best proven on the nose clean 90 degree 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:27.370
 again out a hook angle completely 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.990
 move up to very important on it 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.800
 have you ever seen such it back and forth 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.360
 has disappeared 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.910
 practically in the front of the field 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.919
 baits then hang yourselves rehearsing the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.360
 high must look around takes the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.320
 harbor top and weaken 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.430
 straight line through the rubber bait and 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.220
 lets him look upwards then 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.560
 Looks like this off 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.900
 and as a little tip from me tip 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.420
 maybe not anymore 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.090
 meanwhile you can see the filter 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.790
 kÃ¶ter few millimeters to the front and the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.190
 sink hp tip into this bait 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.150
 because if you are in the cross joyful area 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.010
 or where many tree trunks are trailers 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.830
 is to prevent and when to that 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.730
 anyway the hp-tip time so it is 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.730
 no problem so the guys sees with 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.910
 in the final assembly from quite simple and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.020
 basically everyone has determined 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.180
 ever seen so far or 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.050
 assembled and assembled with 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.460
 I wish that so easy and too 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 Cool leadership does not leave much to say 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.610
 you can let it sink 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.810
 a bit with a wash around 122 times 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.730
 maybe three four times 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.870
 depending on how active the fish are 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.880
 mind you 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.440
 and then you can do it very briefly 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.330
 behind these trees and then out 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.210
 between that he briefly into the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.800
 right rashes are yes to 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.730
 that weight also depending on 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.330
 Water depths are between 08 and two 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.300
 gram should be all about it for a long time 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.479
 Personally this image factory is not 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.350
 more willing the water behaves 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:20.180
 that shows now the same again 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.620
 we have costs for the always very 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.200
 short other cooler mounted so he 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.880
 the better in the water so completely missing 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.880
 normally identify as any other 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:36.739
 fall absinth phase already 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:41.089
 pretty much watching and then 

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:43.909
 just pluck it in times aggressive 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:53.919
 leadership times passive leadership no 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:53.919
 even guidance reason as I said 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:03.169
 that 's always a good thing 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:05.329
 ship area or are the seerosen 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.729
 Although not much is to be found in the industry 

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.979
 biggest but there you can find it behind 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.439
 one or the other was great so you 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.199
 have seen how it works when 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:16.219
 are any suggestions or 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.719
 any ask for victory but 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:22.969
 just visit us on the page 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:24.559
 drop by www.orbis.de and know and 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:27.049
 then contact me directly get her 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:28.239
 also answer immediately if that is or 

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:31.449
 when he uses 

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.449
 all right 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 the
