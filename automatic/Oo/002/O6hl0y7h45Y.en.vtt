00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.290
 but what's up people here codas 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.060
 commenting on this occasion what they 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.770
 I will teach how to put a fixed ip 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.559
 your playstation so you do not know 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.389
 change that she alone once in a while 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.140
 is changing the first thing that we have to 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.689
 make our network go and then what 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.840
 we are going to do is enter into configuration 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.079
 I explain them and here each one of those who 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 Cable WiFi use in my case is cable will 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.349
 we would give 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.530
 the cable and here very important the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 First time we will give you easy voucher 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.309
 so that more or less we are configured 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.160
 according to the internet parameters that 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.960
 have to movistar or not and so on and 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.550
 even in what is then what 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.769
 Let's do is give the first easy 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 ok and once we have it I do not 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.670
 I'm going to do it because I already have it 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.370
 that you do not configure it and once 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.519
 let's have that we've given her her easy 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.500
 connection has been successfully all that blah 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.920
 bla bla bla we will see state of 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.289
 Connection 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 and once we are here we take out 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.070
 our phones or if not if you want 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.780
 you can take out a paper and a pen and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 we point what it is where it says address 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.759
 ip 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.770
 subway mask get away from ls 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.360
 primary and secondary dns is what 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.320
 we have to aim it if you want 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.840
 you can take a picture if it's easier for you 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.179
 and then once we have this it's worth 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 what we are going to do is very important 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.700
 is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.729
 and we again set up connection 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 internet use a cable instead of this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.740
 time to give easy we are going to give 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 personalized and here what we are going to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.119
 put is manual very important voucher 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 manual ip address setting and here as 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.930
 you will see I already have it badly in everything 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 configured us you have to put a 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.830
 same as we did earlier 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 I tell you one thing if you want to change 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.570
 your ip there is no problem this 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.700
 I say it for the people who have followed me 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.300
 followed my other video that said how 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300
 open ports 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.270
 if you want to set the number you had 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 before with which to open you are the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 ports in the ip that you had can be 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.280
 1926 8.1.1 20 129 a vitamin only 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.730
 on 29 30 and 31 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.160
 you will put the number we have 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 put before it is valid to have it already 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.270
 all configured and not have to go back to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.970
 switch between the router and all that and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.740
 for those who are new then 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.400
 directly already put in the ip that 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.810
 want or 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 the ipcc and blanc 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.819
 and now we give you next mtv 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.920
 automatic proxy to use has been 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.540
 updated the configuration and up there 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.970
 with this , I would never go back to 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.190
 changing the ip is a bullshit is a 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.720
 very easy thing that will save us more 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.849
 at once headache I say 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.860
 because he 's on vacation, turn off the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.019
 router turn off the beach so everything and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.390
 when I came back for your open those that 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.819
 follow this channel that we open the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.739
 ports the other time at two three 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.319
 Weeks approximately 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.000
 so what happens when I came back all 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.580
 the configuration were hands not us 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.560
 It served for nothing to see what happened and 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.880
 it turns out that the playstation I do not know how 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.980
 make the router assign another ip and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.090
 this what happens that the ports then 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.690
 we will not be served by those we have 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.920
 open had to remember look at the first 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.950
 in the router the ports that we have 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.780
 Open before if you want and if not then 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.200
 directly if you only want to put 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 a fixed ip so it does not move here 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.360
 here it is clear is a very easy thing 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.830
 complications and for those before 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.300
 I advise you to look at the number as 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.310
 constant and instead of putting the number 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.260
 that we have removed from the configurator 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.450
 has an easy what we are going to do is 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.819
 put that ip number that we had 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.650
 before then if it has been changed by 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.980
 Of course if you not been changed since 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.080
 we also put the same number and then 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.750
 the configuration always look at it in 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.350
 easy because that car configures according to 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.540
 the best parameters for your 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.880
 your company then I advise 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.060
 always pick up those numbers and we're going to 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.350
 put it always the same good with this I 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.350
 dismissal to the next
