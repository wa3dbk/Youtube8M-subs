00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
about you but I'm not looking to play

any<00:01:01.859> chasm<00:01:02.340> blitz<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.670> decided

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
any chasm blitz right now so I decided

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.320 
any chasm blitz right now so I decided
that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> crank

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
that I would do a little bit of crank

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
that I would do a little bit of crank
move<00:01:09.330> around<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.750> bit<00:01:10.909> see<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.119> gonna

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
move around a bit see how this gonna

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
move around a bit see how this gonna
work<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> SMG<00:01:13.500> version<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.920> i

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
work so this is the SMG version so i

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
work so this is the SMG version so i
figured<00:01:14.340> crank<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> perfect<00:01:15.270> game

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
figured crank would be a perfect game

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
figured crank would be a perfect game
mode<00:01:16.189> especially<00:01:17.189> cuz<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> gun<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mode especially cuz this gun is like the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
mode especially cuz this gun is like the
fire<00:01:18.270> rate<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> Scorpion<00:01:19.229> black<00:01:19.470> ops<00:01:19.680> 2<00:01:19.890> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
fire rate of the Scorpion black ops 2 if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.920 
fire rate of the Scorpion black ops 2 if
