impressed with Griffin Griffin is a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
impressed with Griffin Griffin is a
pretty<00:01:52.140> large<00:01:52.380> case<00:01:52.740> manufacturer<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
pretty large case manufacturer and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.219 
pretty large case manufacturer and
usually<00:01:53.909> their<00:01:54.060> products<00:01:54.539> well<00:01:54.720> my

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
usually their products well my

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.779 
usually their products well my
assumption<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.250> large<00:01:56.549> your

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
assumption is that if you're large your

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.160 
assumption is that if you're large your
products<00:01:57.119> aren't<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.960> good

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
products aren't going to be that good

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
products aren't going to be that good
because<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.829> wide<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.369> else<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because really wide what else do you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940 
because really wide what else do you
have<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.060> prove<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.079> Griffin<00:02:01.679> their

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
have to prove but with Griffin their

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
have to prove but with Griffin their
products<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> survivor<00:02:03.119> core<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:03.840> the

products like the survivor core and the

cases way out of the water in terms of

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.300 
cases way out of the water in terms of
design<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.540> slim<00:02:18.870> Armour<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.319> fairly<00:02:19.769> bulky

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
design the slim Armour is fairly bulky

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.039 
design the slim Armour is fairly bulky
so<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.549> will<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:20.940> sleek<00:02:21.209> iPhone<00:02:21.599> 6<00:02:21.900> a

we<00:02:40.440> are<00:02:40.680> very<00:02:40.950> impressed<00:02:41.099> with<00:02:41.459> how<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> case

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
we are very impressed with how the case

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.009 
we are very impressed with how the case
sticks<00:02:42.540> together

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
sticks together

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.110 
sticks together
unlike<00:02:43.650> other<00:02:43.829> two-part<00:02:44.310> cases<00:02:44.790> where<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
unlike other two-part cases where the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.720 
unlike other two-part cases where the
iPhone<00:02:45.450> sits<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.079> soft<00:02:46.349> part<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.220> case

iPhone sits in the soft part of the case
and<00:02:48.030> then<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.239> wrapped<00:02:48.450> by<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> polycarbonate

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and then it's wrapped by a polycarbonate

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.590 
and then it's wrapped by a polycarbonate
shell<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.519> exact<00:02:50.880> opposite<00:02:51.390> with<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
survivor slim I was a little

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.009 
survivor slim I was a little
apprehensive<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.209> Griffin's<00:02:54.569> design<00:02:54.870> but

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
apprehensive of Griffin's design but

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.569 
apprehensive of Griffin's design but
they<00:02:55.079> just<00:02:55.350> don't<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.739> peel<00:02:56.069> away<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
they just don't really peel away that

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.449 
they just don't really peel away that
easily<00:02:56.880> which<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:58.170> nice<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:59.310> find

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
easily which is really nice I just find

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.800 
easily which is really nice I just find

shell and having it really stick into
the<00:03:03.480> case<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.139> glued<00:03:04.829> on<00:03:05.040> or

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the case like it's not glued on or

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.789 
the case like it's not glued on or
anything<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.480> silicon<00:03:06.989> does<00:03:07.290> stick<00:03:07.680> to

get<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.440> decent<00:04:35.680> screen<00:04:36.070> protector<00:04:36.580> maybe<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
get a decent screen protector maybe a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.580 
get a decent screen protector maybe a
plastic<00:04:37.539> one<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.840> one<00:04:37.960> that's<00:04:38.050> not<00:04:38.259> as<00:04:38.380> thick

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
plastic one the one that's not as thick

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.010 
plastic one the one that's not as thick
rather<00:04:38.860> than<00:04:39.070> sticking<00:04:39.490> with<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:40.020> survivor

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
rather than sticking with the survivor

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.810 
rather than sticking with the survivor
all-terrain<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.009> only<00:04:42.220> reason<00:04:42.550> why<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.669> would

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
all-terrain the only reason why I would

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.240 
all-terrain the only reason why I would
get<00:04:43.090> this<00:04:43.270> case<00:04:43.509> is<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.020> well<00:04:44.590> spent<00:04:45.039> a<00:04:45.099> lot

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
get this case is if I well spent a lot

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.070 
get this case is if I well spent a lot
of<00:04:45.280> time<00:04:45.580> around<00:04:45.729> wet<00:04:46.150> places<00:04:46.720> which<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:47.020> don't

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
of time around wet places which I don't

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.469 
of time around wet places which I don't
as<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:48.250> port<00:04:48.490> covers<00:04:48.789> generally<00:04:49.240> are<00:04:49.330> all

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
as the port covers generally are all

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.330 
as the port covers generally are all
covered<00:04:49.840> up<00:04:50.169> with<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.440> call<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.039> sound

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
covered up with the call and sound

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310 
covered up with the call and sound
quality<00:04:51.520> coming<00:04:52.090> from<00:04:52.210> this<00:04:52.360> case<00:04:52.630> from<00:04:53.229> the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
quality coming from this case from the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.439 
quality coming from this case from the
survivor<00:04:53.740> all-terrain<00:04:54.099> is<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.520> little<00:04:55.120> lower

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
survivor all-terrain is a little lower

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.749 
survivor all-terrain is a little lower
so<00:04:56.139> if<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.620> have<00:04:56.740> any<00:04:56.919> questions<00:04:57.340> or<00:04:57.520> if<00:04:57.639> this
