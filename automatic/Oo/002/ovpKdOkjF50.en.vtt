00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
um I it was fascinating to me just

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.170 
um I it was fascinating to me just
because<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:29.920> had<00:01:30.070> never<00:01:30.220> even<00:01:30.730> heard<00:01:30.880> of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
because I had never even heard of

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.130 
because I had never even heard of
something<00:01:31.660> like<00:01:31.810> that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
something like that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350 
something like that
and<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.670> first<00:01:33.850> got<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.120> call<00:01:34.300> I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
and so when I first got the call I

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.450 
and so when I first got the call I
really<00:01:34.750> didn't<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.070> wasn't<00:01:36.280> gonna

really didn't know what I wasn't gonna
involved<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.060> thought<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.270> was<00:01:37.390> gonna<00:01:37.479> be

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
involved I thought it was gonna be

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.270 
involved I thought it was gonna be
fighting<00:01:38.080> or<00:01:38.440> something<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:39.040> don't<00:01:39.190> know<00:01:39.250> what
