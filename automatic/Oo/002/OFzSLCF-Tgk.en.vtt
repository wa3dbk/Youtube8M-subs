00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
night Tucker on that occasion the same

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.049 
night Tucker on that occasion the same
good<00:00:47.760> save

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760 

so<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> straight<00:00:54.960> flicking<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> good

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so it is a straight flicking it's a good

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
so it is a straight flicking it's a good
save<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.300> Nikki<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> line

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
save and it's about Nikki on the line

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.549 
save and it's about Nikki on the line
that<00:00:58.260> gets<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> pat<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.860> back<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.309> D'Souza

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
that gets a pat on the back from D'Souza

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.390 
that gets a pat on the back from D'Souza
so<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.519> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> head<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> D

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
so here it was from the head of the D

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.350
