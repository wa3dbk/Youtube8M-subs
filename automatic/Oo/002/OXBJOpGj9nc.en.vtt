00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.680

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.720

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.179

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.009
 what a roll because I 'm not going to 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.190
 tell a lot of the story there is a 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.850
 tangle out there in terms of names and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.580
 all this for a certain situation that 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.240

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.980
 nice that you want to believe me well jose 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.170
 ignacio with everyone you're the same 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.300
 as I remember knowing the past a 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.690
 traditional melodrama but with touches of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.989
 comedy as you have felt with the psoe 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.989
 Well the truth is that it is something different 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.030
 for me because I had never worked 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.829
 this genre then if I arrived already 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 you know I was throwing the drama if I want to do 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 pink diamond 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.000
 and then I do not no here is not the wave 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 all right 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.390
 We continue in the facilities of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.180
 argos in mexico where is being recorded 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 the pink diamond soap opera and look at nothing 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.619
 plus the dressing room of whom I met 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.850
 Mauricio who makes the character of joseph 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:22.939
 ignacio let's see if he is mauricio 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.860
 Mauritius must be had today 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.750
 I like to visit you until the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.149
 dressing room now we almost got 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.549
 almost that up to the kitchen so if not 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.990
 but welcome is a boy that without 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.590
 doubt good in love with women 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.159
 somewhat cheeky we could say or not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.150
 no embarrassment a little handsome already low 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.990
 my voice is trembling 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.340
 not the truth is that I am like enough 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 light and pretty joker and not in the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.520
 life then that's a bit what I 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 I've put the character is being 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.140
 fun because it starts 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.990
 making more antagonistic than protagonist 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.300
 do not start doing more as 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.300
 all this calculating womanizer 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.430
 ambitious manipulator but from a 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.430
 very lovely way
