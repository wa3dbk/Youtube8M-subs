00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
well that burger was made in about a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
well that burger was made in about a
minute<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.450> process<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.049> through

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
minute or so the process we go through

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080

on the average shoot takes several hours
and<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.409> important<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> note

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and here I think it's important to note

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.850 
and here I think it's important to note
that<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> ingredients<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.780> Noah<00:01:34.350> uses

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that all the ingredients that Noah uses

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
that all the ingredients that Noah uses
are<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> exact<00:01:35.549> same<00:01:35.759> ingredients<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.299> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
are the exact same ingredients that we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.110 
are the exact same ingredients that we
use<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
use in the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.330 
use in the
restaurant<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.410> exact<00:01:38.710> same<00:01:38.920> Patty's

it<00:02:49.450> looks<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.350> looks<00:02:50.500> more

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
it looks but actually it looks more

it looks but actually it looks more
appetizing<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.459> more<00:02:51.610> convincing<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:53.290> just

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
appetizing and more convincing but just

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.650 
appetizing and more convincing but just
enhancing<00:02:54.070> some<00:02:54.280> color<00:02:54.489> taking<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.150> some<00:02:55.570> of

the little accents it might happen in
preparation<00:02:57.850> which<00:02:58.000> obviously<00:02:58.239> doesn't<00:02:58.540> show

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
preparation which obviously doesn't show

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.850 
preparation which obviously doesn't show
the<00:02:59.260> product<00:02:59.560> at<00:02:59.620> its<00:02:59.770> best<00:02:59.920> possible<00:03:00.160> light

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the product at its best possible light

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.930 
the product at its best possible light
here<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.070> definitely<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> there's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
here you can definitely see that there's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.600 
here you can definitely see that there's
a<00:03:04.030> size<00:03:04.239> difference<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.770> box<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.250> are<00:03:06.310> say

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
a size difference the box that are say

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.460 
a size difference the box that are say
witches<00:03:06.910> come<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.330> keep<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.690> sandwiches<00:03:08.140> warm

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
witches come in keep the sandwiches warm

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.320 
witches come in keep the sandwiches warm
so<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:08.860> creates<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> bit<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.430> steam<00:03:09.730> effect

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
so it creates a bit of a steam effect

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.060 
so it creates a bit of a steam effect
and<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.750> does<00:03:10.870> make<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.140> button<00:03:11.470> contract<00:03:11.920> a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
and it does make the button contract a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.220 
and it does make the button contract a
little<00:03:12.280> bit<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.730> then<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> main<00:03:13.780> difference

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
little bit and then the main difference

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.870 
little bit and then the main difference
is<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.590> fact<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:14.890> we<00:03:15.070> actually<00:03:15.489> took<00:03:15.700> all

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
is the fact that we actually took all

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.250 
is the fact that we actually took all
the<00:03:16.000> ingredients<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.600> are<00:03:16.720> normally<00:03:17.020> hidden

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
the ingredients that are normally hidden

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.720 
the ingredients that are normally hidden
under<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> bun<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.100> pulled<00:03:18.340> them<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
under the bun and we pulled them to the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.759 
under the bun and we pulled them to the
