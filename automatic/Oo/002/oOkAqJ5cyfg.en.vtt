00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.480
 this is the channel we say today bought a test 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.830
 on nitrates and decided since I breed 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.119
 coupe and decided to measure the amount 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.810
 nitrates in this aquarium 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.150
 I thought that the amount will be small 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.750
 because I have a lot of plant here 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.180
 enough and fish like a little I'm 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.510
 thought that plants consume nitrates 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:42.100
 as if quickly and the amount of their water will be 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.580
 small and so i did a test and i strongly 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.280
 surprised because a decent amount 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:58.199
 them in the water that's what I got and 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.170
 this scale is approximately 30 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.360
 miller can even more level 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.469
 solid because it is written in 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.579
 literature that with so many 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.200
 develops begin to develop in 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.710
 industries 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.710
 and in general, in principle, I do not know how much 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 what dose of the type so that the nitrates would 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 not toxic to fish but probably rub 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.859
 need treatment and it probably means that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:37.859
 but the type of water is not very pure quality 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:42.479
 water is not very well and that's why i decided to co2 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.479
 the feed is fed into the water to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 Well, so that plants grow faster and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 absorbed these nutrients here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:04.420
 trace elements that give water and nitrates 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.420
 so that's it for now 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.149
 not
