00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
tattoo would be a good idea and I this I

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.870 
tattoo would be a good idea and I this I
did<00:01:37.090> at<00:01:37.270> 3<00:01:37.600> a.m.<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.310> tell<00:01:39.640> me<00:01:39.759> about

kind of well before all my when's is

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.310 
kind of well before all my when's is
nothing<00:01:45.670> really<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:46.030> have<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.270> plan<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:46.960> I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
nothing really that I have a plan it's I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.050 
nothing really that I have a plan it's I
just<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:48.040> go<00:01:48.280> out<00:01:48.399> there<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:48.850> fun

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
just I just go out there and have fun

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.180 
just I just go out there and have fun
and<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.420> guess<00:01:49.570> that's<00:01:49.720> what<00:01:50.009> everyone's<00:01:51.009> here

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
and I guess that's what everyone's here

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.940 
and I guess that's what everyone's here
for<00:01:51.430> we're<00:01:51.729> entering<00:01:52.090> into<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.360> new<00:01:52.420> year<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.950> I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
for we're entering into a new year and I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.040 
for we're entering into a new year and I
guess<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:54.909> should<00:01:55.060> start<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.390> with<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.540> bang<00:01:55.780> so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
guess we should start it with a bang so
