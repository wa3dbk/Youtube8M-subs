in<00:00:00.149> this<00:00:00.299> video<00:00:00.480> let's<00:00:00.780> try<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> find<00:00:01.439> out<00:00:01.620> the

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
in this video let's try to find out the

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.860 
in this video let's try to find out the
solution<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:02.909> equation<00:00:03.179> right<00:00:03.659> let's

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
solution of this in equation right let's

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.840 
solution of this in equation right let's
try<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> solve<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> previous<00:00:05.609> videos

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
try to solve it in the previous videos

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.639 
try to solve it in the previous videos
we<00:00:05.879> had<00:00:06.089> got<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> little<00:00:06.540> bit<00:00:06.660> easier<00:00:07.170> questions

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
we had got a little bit easier questions

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.370 
we had got a little bit easier questions
and<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.340> little<00:00:08.700> bit<00:00:09.200> complexities<00:00:10.200> than

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and here a little bit complexities than

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100 
and here a little bit complexities than
the<00:00:10.500> previous<00:00:10.860> equations<00:00:11.490> alright<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
the previous equations alright so the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.070 
the previous equations alright so the
first<00:00:13.380> rule<00:00:13.679> while<00:00:14.460> solving<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.030> any<00:00:15.750> in

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
first rule while solving the any in

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.109 
first rule while solving the any in
equation<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> collecting<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.789> variable

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
equation is collecting all the variable

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
equation is collecting all the variable
containing<00:00:18.420> Tommy<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.140> side<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.830> here

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
containing Tommy to the one side so here

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.040 
containing Tommy to the one side so here
our<00:00:20.220> variable<00:00:20.609> containing<00:00:20.910> term<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.750> one

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
our variable containing term is this one

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.900 
our variable containing term is this one
and<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.279> need<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:23.640> into<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and at this one we need to make into the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.550 
and at this one we need to make into the
one<00:00:24.090> side<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> constant<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
one side and all the constant on the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
one side and all the constant on the
numbers<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.340> need<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> keep<00:00:26.760> into<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> another

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
numbers we need to keep into the another

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.769 
numbers we need to keep into the another
side

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
side

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.970 
side
so<00:00:28.910> first<00:00:29.910> I'm<00:00:30.090> writing<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> 2x<00:00:31.140> minus<00:00:31.560> 3<00:00:31.830> D

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
so first I'm writing this 2x minus 3 D

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.950 
so first I'm writing this 2x minus 3 D
by<00:00:32.009> RF<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.329> need<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> bring<00:00:33.780> this

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
by RF or and I need to bring this

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.959 
by RF or and I need to bring this
variable<00:00:34.710> containing<00:00:35.010> term<00:00:35.250> X<00:00:35.460> containing

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
variable containing term X containing

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
variable containing term X containing
Tom<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> left-hand<00:00:36.780> side<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
Tom into the left-hand side so it is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.900 
Tom into the left-hand side so it is
plus<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.040> need<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> come<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> side<00:00:38.790> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
plus and I need to come this side it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.420 
plus and I need to come this side it
will<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.059> minus<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.960> it'll<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> minus<00:00:40.430> 4x

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
will be minus so it'll be minus 4x

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
will be minus so it'll be minus 4x
divided<00:00:41.940> by<00:00:42.090> 3<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.629> equals<00:00:43.500> 2<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> great

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
divided by 3 and equals 2 and great

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
divided by 3 and equals 2 and great
sedan<00:00:44.489> alright<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.420> equals<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> greater

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
sedan alright is equals to and greater

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
sedan alright is equals to and greater
than<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.739> plus<00:00:47.190> 9<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.550> need<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
than this is plus 9 I need to take it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
than this is plus 9 I need to take it
taken<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> another<00:00:49.020> side<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.559> will<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.739> minus

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
taken to another side that will be minus

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
taken to another side that will be minus
9<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.539> 3<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> initially<00:00:52.410> from

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
9 all right and this 3 is initially from

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250 
9 all right and this 3 is initially from
here<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> simple

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
here so now I have to do the simple

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.010 
here so now I have to do the simple
calculation<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> simple<00:00:57.180> simplification<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
calculation in a simple simplification I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.779 
calculation in a simple simplification I
need<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.100> let's<00:00:59.309> take<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> LCM

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
need to do so first let's take the LCM

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.869 
need to do so first let's take the LCM
of<00:00:59.910> 4<00:01:00.090> &amp;<00:01:00.239> 3<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.410> 12<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
of 4 &amp; 3 that is my 12 all right and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
of 4 &amp; 3 that is my 12 all right and
then<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.600> divide<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.019> 12<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.589> will

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
then when one will divide this 12 I will

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
then when one will divide this 12 I will
get<00:01:05.280> 3<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> 3<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.689> multiply<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.140> 2x

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
get 3 so this 3 will multiply this 2x

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
get 3 so this 3 will multiply this 2x
minus<00:01:08.520> 3<00:01:08.790> similarly<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> 3<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.140> divide

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
minus 3 similarly this 3 will divide

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
minus 3 similarly this 3 will divide
this<00:01:10.619> 12<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.070> I'll<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.150> we'll

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this 12 so I'll get here for that we'll

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
this 12 so I'll get here for that we'll
multiply<00:01:12.420> 4x<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.979> greater<00:01:14.250> than<00:01:14.369> or

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
multiply 4x and is greater than or

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.109 
multiply 4x and is greater than or
equals<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> minus<00:01:14.970> 6<00:01:15.770> further<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.030> now

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
equals to minus 6 further it will be now

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.260 
equals to minus 6 further it will be now
3<00:01:18.420> times<00:01:18.689> -<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.979> 6<00:01:20.790> X<00:01:21.060> 3

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
3 times - all right so it will be 6 X 3

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.590 
3 times - all right so it will be 6 X 3
times<00:01:22.020> 3<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.009> minus<00:01:23.549> 9<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
times 3 that will be minus 9 and this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280 
times 3 that will be minus 9 and this
will<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.840> minus<00:01:25.020> 16<00:01:25.590> X<00:01:26.119> divided<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.270> 12<00:01:27.750> all

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
will be minus 16 X divided by 12 all

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
will be minus 16 X divided by 12 all
right<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.680> greater<00:01:29.220> than<00:01:29.400> equals<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> again

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
right is greater than equals to again

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.410 
right is greater than equals to again
minus<00:01:30.420> 6<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> 6x<00:01:33.240> or

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
minus 6 and again here this is 6x or

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
minus 6 and again here this is 6x or
minus<00:01:33.720> 16x<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> minus<00:01:34.979> 10x<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:36.270> right

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
minus 16x so this is minus 10x all right

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.730 
minus 16x so this is minus 10x all right
divided<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.530> 12<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> again<00:01:39.150> minus<00:01:39.540> 9<00:01:39.840> divided

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
divided by 12 and again minus 9 divided

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
divided by 12 and again minus 9 divided
by<00:01:40.950> 2l<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> equals<00:01:41.729> 2<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.970> greater<00:01:42.060> than

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
by 2l and equals 2 and greater than

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
by 2l and equals 2 and greater than
minus<00:01:42.630> 6<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.290> again<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.979> constant

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
minus 6 so again we got a one constant

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.170 
minus 6 so again we got a one constant
Tom<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:45.000> right

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
Tom all right

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
Tom all right
this<00:01:45.689> constant<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> shift<00:01:46.950> into

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this constant I want you to shift into

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
this constant I want you to shift into
the<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.520> side<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.180> let's<00:01:48.360> sift<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.380> we'll

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the other side so let's sift it so we'll

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
the other side so let's sift it so we'll
get<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.060> cut<00:01:51.240> by<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
get here now this is we can cut by the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.200 
get here now this is we can cut by the
two<00:01:51.750> also<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:54.030> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
two also if you want all right it's now

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.950 
two also if you want all right it's now
minus<00:01:54.570> 10x<00:01:54.869> divided<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:56.130> 12<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.729> greater<00:01:57.630> than

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
minus 10x divided by 12 is greater than

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.639

plus<00:02:02.390> 9<00:02:03.390> over<00:02:03.719> 12<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.950> minus<00:02:05.670> 10x

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
plus 9 over 12 so it's now minus 10x

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.330

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
minus 63 and now we are in such a stage

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.860 
minus 63 and now we are in such a stage
where<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.580> standard<00:02:26.970> stays<00:02:27.180> write<00:02:27.510> like

so<00:02:33.870> whenever<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.620> stage<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:34.980> have

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so whenever we get in this stage we have

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.250 
so whenever we get in this stage we have
to<00:02:35.430> divide<00:02:35.700> by<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.880> coefficient<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to divide by the coefficient of the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.540 
to divide by the coefficient of the
variable<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.860> left<00:02:37.890> hand<00:02:38.099> side<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.430> well

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
variable to the left hand side as well

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.390 
variable to the left hand side as well
as<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:38.880> hand<00:02:38.910> side<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.390> right<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.400> it's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
as the right hand side all right so it's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.589 
as the right hand side all right so it's
minus<00:02:41.880> 10x<00:02:42.510> divided<00:02:43.170> by<00:02:43.489> minus<00:02:44.489> 10<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.450> is

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
minus 10x divided by minus 10 and it is

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.530 
minus 10x divided by minus 10 and it is
minus<00:02:45.989> 63<00:02:46.349> divided<00:02:46.890> by<00:02:47.069> minus<00:02:47.400> 10<00:02:47.580> whenever<00:02:48.060> we

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
minus 63 divided by minus 10 whenever we

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
minus 63 divided by minus 10 whenever we
divide<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.200> multiply<00:02:49.290> by<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.860> negative

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
divide or multiply by the negative

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
divide or multiply by the negative
number<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.120> sign<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.690> changed<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.470> right

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
number the sign get changed all right

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.130 
number the sign get changed all right
it<00:02:52.950> gets<00:02:53.220> reversed<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.690> turning

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it gets reversed so here it is turning

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.870 
it gets reversed so here it is turning
this<00:02:55.290> side<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.040> greater<00:02:56.400> than<00:02:56.549> or<00:02:56.640> equal<00:02:56.700> to

this side it's greater than or equal to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.210 
this side it's greater than or equal to
sign<00:02:57.150> now<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.900> will<00:02:58.049> be<00:02:58.200> less<00:02:58.799> than<00:02:58.829> or<00:02:59.069> equal

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
sign now it will be less than or equal

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.860 
sign now it will be less than or equal
to<00:02:59.459> sign<00:02:59.730> because<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.239> know<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.630> when<00:03:00.840> you

the<00:03:06.329> inequality<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.290> reversed<00:03:07.860> all<00:03:08.190> right<00:03:08.340> so

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the inequality get reversed all right so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400 
the inequality get reversed all right so

10<00:03:15.360> all<00:03:15.690> right<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.950> six<00:03:17.400> point<00:03:17.730> three

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
10 all right so it's six point three

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.280 
10 all right so it's six point three
actually<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.750> see<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.019> number

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
actually and if you see in the number

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
actually and if you see in the number
line<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.930> zero<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:22.650> two<00:03:23.130> three<00:03:23.850> four

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
line if this is zero one two three four

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.110 
line if this is zero one two three four
five<00:03:25.230> six<00:03:25.859> seven

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
five six seven

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.849 
five six seven
all<00:03:27.209> right<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.750> six<00:03:28.170> point<00:03:28.410> three<00:03:28.470> will<00:03:28.709> be

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
all right so six point three will be

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.620 
all right so six point three will be
somewhere<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:30.090> right<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.420> will<00:03:30.569> be

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
somewhere here all right this will be

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.110 
somewhere here all right this will be
this<00:03:31.530> will<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.920> six<00:03:32.190> point<00:03:32.519> three<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
this will be six point three or you can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.140 
this will be six point three or you can
say<00:03:33.269> 63<00:03:33.900> over<00:03:33.930> ten<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:35.130> here<00:03:35.340> our<00:03:35.519> solution<00:03:35.790> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
say 63 over ten so here our solution is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.960 
say 63 over ten so here our solution is
X<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.959> less<00:03:37.260> than<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.709> equals<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.069> 63<00:03:38.579> over<00:03:38.609> ten

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
X is less than or equals to 63 over ten

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.039 
X is less than or equals to 63 over ten
so<00:03:39.590> including<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.239> all<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.780> number

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
so including this and all the number

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.319 
so including this and all the number
less<00:03:43.260> than<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.620> 63<00:03:44.069> over<00:03:44.100> ten<00:03:44.459> teen<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.209> is

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
less than this 63 over ten teen this is

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.789 
less than this 63 over ten teen this is
negative<00:03:45.630> infinity<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.200> positive<00:03:46.680> is

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
negative infinity this is positive is

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.660 
negative infinity this is positive is
ready<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.700> our<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.109> our

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
ready so this is our this is our

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.120 
ready so this is our this is our
solution<00:03:50.670> all<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.600> number<00:03:51.870> all<00:03:52.410> right<00:03:52.560> which

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
solution all the number all right which

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.400 
solution all the number all right which
are<00:03:53.280> less<00:03:53.940> than<00:03:53.970> 63<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.200> negative

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
are less than 63 and is this negative

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.720 
are less than 63 and is this negative
infinity<00:03:56.010> from<00:03:56.940> negative<00:03:57.269> infinity<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.959> till

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
infinity from negative infinity to till

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.819 
infinity from negative infinity to till
63<00:03:59.730> over<00:03:59.910> ten<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.660> here<00:04:01.079> is<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.349> big<00:04:01.500> bracket

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
63 over ten and here is the big bracket

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.530 
63 over ten and here is the big bracket
I'm<00:04:02.040> giving<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> closing<00:04:03.000> bracket<00:04:03.299> why<00:04:03.420> I'm

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
I'm giving the closing bracket why I'm

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.910 
I'm giving the closing bracket why I'm
giving<00:04:03.690> closing<00:04:04.109> bracket<00:04:04.380> because<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:04.799> is

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
giving closing bracket because here is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.770 
giving closing bracket because here is
equals<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.250> sign<00:04:05.459> all<00:04:05.849> right<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.599> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
equals to sign all right so this is the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.410 
equals to sign all right so this is the
solution<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.230> this
