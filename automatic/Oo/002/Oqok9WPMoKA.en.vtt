is<00:00:20.070> speculation<00:00:20.849> though<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.140> follow

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is speculation though but if you follow

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.909 
is speculation though but if you follow
the<00:00:22.680> PC<00:00:23.070> update<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.790> you<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.360> that<00:00:24.630> 1.3.1<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
the PC update and you see that 1.3.1 is

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.269 
the PC update and you see that 1.3.1 is
the<00:00:26.099> next<00:00:26.369> big<00:00:26.579> a<00:00:26.759> change<00:00:27.029> update<00:00:27.720> /<00:00:28.230> -<00:00:28.470> PC<00:00:29.070> and

three<00:01:23.399> layers<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:24.030> layers<00:01:24.329> just<00:01:24.899> useless

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
three layers the top layers just useless

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
three layers the top layers just useless
I<00:01:25.409> guess<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.679> could<00:01:25.770> come<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
I guess you could come up there get a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.529 
I guess you could come up there get a
nice<00:01:27.119> view<00:01:27.569> of<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.219> jungle<00:01:29.219> which<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
nice view of that jungle which is not a

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.590 
nice view of that jungle which is not a
jungle<00:01:30.840> scumbag<00:01:31.530> eskimo<00:01:32.249> but<00:01:32.819> the<00:01:33.420> middle

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
jungle scumbag eskimo but the middle

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.719 
jungle scumbag eskimo but the middle
layer<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.469> useless<00:01:34.679> as<00:01:35.069> well<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
layer is pretty useless as well but the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
layer is pretty useless as well but the
bottom<00:01:35.759> layers<00:01:36.389> where<00:01:36.719> it<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.049> gets

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
bottom layers where it all gets

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.739 
bottom layers where it all gets
crack-a-lackin'<00:01:38.520> nails<00:01:38.819> go<00:01:39.149> down<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
crack-a-lackin' nails go down here and

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.080 
crack-a-lackin' nails go down here and
