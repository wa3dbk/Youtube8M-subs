to<00:00:22.029> make<00:00:22.150> it<00:00:22.300> look<00:00:22.420> like<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.869> one<00:00:23.050> it's<00:00:23.439> the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
to make it look like this one it's the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.140 
to make it look like this one it's the
same<00:00:23.770> concept<00:00:24.310> just<00:00:24.520> using<00:00:25.060> different

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
same concept just using different

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.929 
same concept just using different
features<00:00:25.720> so<00:00:26.110> without<00:00:26.680> further<00:00:26.890> ado<00:00:27.220> let's

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
features so without further ado let's

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.420 
features so without further ado let's
begin<00:00:31.200> right<00:00:32.200> so<00:00:32.439> just<00:00:32.680> like<00:00:32.829> my<00:00:32.860> last<00:00:33.190> wagon

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
begin right so just like my last wagon

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.800 
begin right so just like my last wagon
tutorial<00:00:34.060> we're<00:00:34.149> going<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.329> start<00:00:34.570> off<00:00:34.660> with

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
tutorial we're going to start off with

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.510 
tutorial we're going to start off with
the<00:00:34.899> wheels<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.440> these<00:00:36.010> are<00:00:36.130> just<00:00:36.220> stairs

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
the wheels and these are just stairs

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.310 
the wheels and these are just stairs
facing<00:00:37.000> each<00:00:37.120> other<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.480> every<00:00:37.750> direction<00:00:37.870> and

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
facing each other in every direction and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.229 
facing each other in every direction and
there's<00:00:38.980> going<00:00:39.070> to<00:00:39.129> be<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.280> three-block<00:00:40.000> gap

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
there's going to be a three-block gap

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.569 
there's going to be a three-block gap
between<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.960> front<00:00:41.379> and<00:00:41.620> back<00:00:41.949> wheels<00:00:42.219> and

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
between the front and back wheels and

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.549 
between the front and back wheels and
then<00:00:43.300> across<00:00:43.719> here<00:00:43.989> there's<00:00:44.199> going<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.469> a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
then across here there's going to be a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.430 
then across here there's going to be a
full<00:00:44.890> block<00:00:45.100> gap<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.579> one<00:00:45.850> two<00:00:46.210> three<00:00:46.239> four<00:00:46.929> and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
full block gap so one two three four and

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.169 
full block gap so one two three four and
then<00:00:47.469> you're<00:00:48.160> going<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.309> replicate<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.879> exact

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
then you're going to replicate the exact

00:00:49.179 --> 00:01:05.930 
then you're going to replicate the exact
same<00:00:49.420> thing<00:00:49.660> over<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:50.140> this<00:00:50.260> side

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.250 

so<00:01:06.940> once<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.270> position<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.780> wheels<00:01:07.990> we're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
so once you position the wheels we're

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.870 
so once you position the wheels we're
going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.440> do<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.680> underbelly<00:01:09.160> of<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.550> wagon

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
going to do the underbelly of the wagon

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.340 
going to do the underbelly of the wagon
so<00:01:10.360> we're<00:01:10.480> going<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.630> start<00:01:10.810> off<00:01:10.930> from<00:01:11.080> this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
so we're going to start off from this

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.020 
so we're going to start off from this
upside<00:01:11.830> down<00:01:11.860> stair<00:01:12.250> block<00:01:12.460> I'm<00:01:12.640> just<00:01:12.910> going

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
upside down stair block I'm just going

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.940 
upside down stair block I'm just going
to<00:01:13.090> zigzag<00:01:13.300> all<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.080> way<00:01:14.170> across<00:01:14.470> until<00:01:14.680> it

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
to zigzag all the way across until it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:26.899 
to zigzag all the way across until it
meets<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.220> other<00:01:15.400> side

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.219 

so<00:01:27.909> if<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.180> were<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.689> front<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
so if this were to be the front of the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.410 
so if this were to be the front of the
wagon<00:01:29.350> what<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.920> need<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.130> do<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:30.939> extend

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
wagon what you need to do is just extend

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.810 
wagon what you need to do is just extend
an<00:01:31.780> extra<00:01:32.380> block<00:01:32.530> across<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.159> then<00:01:33.369> add<00:01:33.549> a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
an extra block across and then add a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.570 
an extra block across and then add a
corner<00:01:34.299> then<00:01:35.110> grab<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.560> full<00:01:35.950> block<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.399> place

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
corner then grab a full block and place

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.670 
corner then grab a full block and place
it<00:01:36.759> right<00:01:36.939> beside<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.360> wheels<00:01:37.570> then<00:01:38.470> we<00:01:38.560> can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
it right beside the wheels then we can

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.469 
it right beside the wheels then we can
add<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.039> frame<00:01:39.340> where<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.759> prisoners<00:01:40.329> will

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
add the frame where the prisoners will

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.249 
add the frame where the prisoners will
go<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.259> going<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.470> go<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.770> follows<00:01:42.189> 1<00:01:42.580> 2<00:01:42.850> 3

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
go and it's going to go as follows 1 2 3

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.370 
go and it's going to go as follows 1 2 3
1<00:01:44.259> 2<00:01:44.289> 3<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.009> same<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.060> other<00:01:46.090> side<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:46.840> 1<00:01:47.110> 2

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
1 2 3 and same on the other side so 1 2

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
1 2 3 and same on the other side so 1 2
3<00:01:48.000> 1<00:01:49.000> 2<00:01:49.240> 3<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.710> you're<00:01:50.830> going<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.009> join<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.310> up

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
3 1 2 3 then you're going to join it up

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.810 
3 1 2 3 then you're going to join it up
with<00:01:52.600> full<00:01:52.840> blocks<00:01:53.110> ignoring<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.280> front<00:01:54.610> and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
with full blocks ignoring the front and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.779 
with full blocks ignoring the front and
back<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.740> what<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.950> need<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.100> do<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.490> grab

the<00:02:25.239> roof<00:02:25.420> we're<00:02:25.689> going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.870> use<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.019> different

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
the roof we're going to use a different

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.470 
the roof we're going to use a different
wood<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.069> going<00:02:27.219> to<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.549> follows<00:02:27.999> one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
wood and it's going to go as follows one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.539 
wood and it's going to go as follows one
two<00:02:28.749> three<00:02:29.139> four<00:02:29.439> five<00:02:29.769> blocks<00:02:30.129> straight

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
two three four five blocks straight

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.910 
two three four five blocks straight
across<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:31.599> extend<00:02:32.049> an<00:02:32.260> extra<00:02:32.560> block<00:02:32.709> on

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
across and then extend an extra block on

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.899 
across and then extend an extra block on
either<00:02:33.069> end<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> repeat<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.359> process<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
either end and repeat the process and

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.339 
either end and repeat the process and
then<00:02:36.909> do<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> exact<00:02:37.480> same<00:02:37.510> thing<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.049> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
then do the exact same thing on the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.530 
then do the exact same thing on the
other<00:02:38.379> side

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.710 

and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.459> finish<00:02:45.730> off<00:02:45.849> with<00:02:45.909> some<00:02:46.510> full

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
and then finish off with some full

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:56.699 
and then finish off with some full
blocks

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.140 

right<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:57.920> almost<00:02:58.430> done<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.670> need<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.030> add

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
right so almost done just need to add

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.759 
right so almost done just need to add
some<00:02:59.180> minor<00:02:59.720> details<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.439> then<00:03:00.530> I'll<00:03:00.650> show

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
some minor details and then I'll show

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.289 
some minor details and then I'll show
you<00:03:00.860> how<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.010> change<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.489> round<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
you how to change this round to the

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.630 
you how to change this round to the
second<00:03:02.750> design<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.680> what<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.129> need<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> do<00:03:04.430> is

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
second design so what we need to do is

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.059 
second design so what we need to do is
just<00:03:04.790> add<00:03:04.970> some<00:03:05.239> stairs<00:03:05.540> here<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.260> here<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
just add some stairs here and here so

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.470 
just add some stairs here and here so
you<00:03:07.129> get<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.310> little<00:03:07.459> bit<00:03:07.579> of<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.790> curved<00:03:08.090> effect

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you get a little bit of a curved effect

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.380 
you get a little bit of a curved effect
and<00:03:08.720> we<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:08.959> fit<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.319> some<00:03:09.799> fence<00:03:10.269> do<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
and we can fit in some fence do the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.809 
and we can fit in some fence do the
exact<00:03:11.690> same<00:03:11.870> thing<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.470> other<00:03:12.500> side<00:03:12.819> so

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
exact same thing on the other side so

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.229 
exact same thing on the other side so
fence<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.810> fence<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:19.000> then<00:03:20.000> we're<00:03:20.090> going<00:03:20.209> to

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
fence and fence and then we're going to

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.140 
fence and fence and then we're going to
add<00:03:20.390> some<00:03:20.930> small<00:03:21.409> windows<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.310> that's<00:03:22.940> going

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
add some small windows and that's going

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.210 
add some small windows and that's going
to<00:03:23.239> go<00:03:23.359> as<00:03:23.540> follows<00:03:23.989> first<00:03:24.829> thing<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.040> need<00:03:25.129> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
to go as follows first thing we need to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.280 
to go as follows first thing we need to
do<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.519> add<00:03:25.700> some<00:03:25.730> full<00:03:26.150> blocks<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.689> then<00:03:27.230> you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
do is add some full blocks and then you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.020 
do is add some full blocks and then you
actually<00:03:27.530> need<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.829> grab<00:03:28.069> some<00:03:28.400> jungle<00:03:28.909> wood

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
actually need to grab some jungle wood

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.300 
actually need to grab some jungle wood
stairs<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.950> you're<00:03:30.950> going<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.099> place<00:03:31.280> one

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
stairs and you're going to place one

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.629 
stairs and you're going to place one
here<00:03:31.879> and<00:03:32.060> another<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:34.549> the

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
here and another one here and do the

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.630 
here and another one here and do the
exact<00:03:34.909> same<00:03:34.940> thing<00:03:35.409> facing<00:03:36.409> upwards

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
and then you can add some awkward stairs

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.160 
and then you can add some awkward stairs
and<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.870> where<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.460> where<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:46.210> don't

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
I'm going to show you how to change

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.530 
I'm going to show you how to change
around<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.250> design<00:04:15.550> to<00:04:16.000> make<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.269> look<00:04:16.390> like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
around the design to make it look like

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.789 
around the design to make it look like
the<00:04:16.660> one<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.810> showed<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.200> at<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.350> start<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.709> the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
the one I showed you at the start of the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.470 
the one I showed you at the start of the
video<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.640> what<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.880> need<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.030> do<00:04:19.180> for<00:04:19.329> this

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
video and what you need to do for this

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.240 
video and what you need to do for this
is<00:04:19.690> start<00:04:19.989> off<00:04:20.079> by<00:04:20.260> removing<00:04:20.320> all<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.100> iron

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
is start off by removing all of the iron

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.940 
is start off by removing all of the iron
bars<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.820> add<00:04:22.419> two<00:04:23.080> doors<00:04:23.290> on<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> front<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
bars and add two doors on the front and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.100 
bars and add two doors on the front and
fill<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.700> gap<00:04:24.880> with<00:04:25.180> full<00:04:25.750> blocks<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.960> then

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
fill in the gap with full blocks so then

the<00:05:06.669> reason<00:05:06.910> why<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.030> haven't<00:05:07.300> been<00:05:07.419> working<00:05:07.660> on

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
the reason why I haven't been working on

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.870 
the reason why I haven't been working on
that<00:05:08.020> is<00:05:08.200> simply<00:05:08.500> because<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:09.400> update<00:05:09.729> to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
that is simply because the the update to

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.460 
that is simply because the the update to
one<00:05:10.000> point<00:05:10.150> five<00:05:10.330> point<00:05:10.510> one<00:05:10.690> has<00:05:10.870> screwed<00:05:11.380> up

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
one point five point one has screwed up

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.320 
one point five point one has screwed up
all<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.770> mods<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.160> need<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.030> example

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
all the mods that I need so for example

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.060 
all the mods that I need so for example
camera<00:05:13.660> studio<00:05:13.870> mod<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.380> can't<00:05:14.860> do<00:05:14.950> the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
camera studio mod I can't do the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.340 
camera studio mod I can't do the
cinematic<00:05:15.550> without<00:05:15.790> it<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.600> is<00:05:16.750> just<00:05:17.200> the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
cinematic without it so that is just the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.630 
cinematic without it so that is just the
reason<00:05:17.560> why<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:17.710> haven't<00:05:17.919> been<00:05:18.100> working<00:05:18.280> on<00:05:18.520> it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
reason why I haven't been working on it

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.250 
reason why I haven't been working on it
