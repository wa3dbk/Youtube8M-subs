00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
what do you do when you have the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.310 
what do you do when you have the
best-selling<00:00:14.460> best<00:00:15.059> performing<00:00:15.690> Finn<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.170> the

best-selling best performing Finn in the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.400 
best-selling best performing Finn in the
world<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> even<00:00:17.760> better<00:00:18.199> that's<00:00:19.199> a

world to make it even better that's a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.290 
world to make it even better that's a
tough<00:00:19.650> question<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.550> thought<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> for

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
tough question we thought about this for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
tough question we thought about this for
a<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:21.600> long<00:00:22.050> time<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> end<00:00:23.490> we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
a very long time and in the end we

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.070 
a very long time and in the end we
changed<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.310> material<00:00:26.699> formulation<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
changed the material formulation just a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.009 
changed the material formulation just a
little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.340> result<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> maras<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
little bit the result is the maras of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
little bit the result is the maras of
anti<00:00:31.320> cuatro<00:00:31.740> plus<00:00:32.510> undoubtedly<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.870> most

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
anti cuatro plus undoubtedly the most

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
anti cuatro plus undoubtedly the most
successful<00:00:34.800> fin<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.250> scuba<00:00:35.640> diving<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
successful fin in scuba diving in the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.430 
successful fin in scuba diving in the
last<00:00:36.450> 20<00:00:36.960> years

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

last 20 years
it<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:39.570> responsive<00:00:40.440> material

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
it now has a more responsive material

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
it now has a more responsive material
that<00:00:41.190> allows<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> better<00:00:42.360> channel

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that allows you for a better channel

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
that allows you for a better channel
formation<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:44.309> comfortable<00:00:44.610> kick<00:00:45.120> but

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
formation a more comfortable kick but

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.560 
formation a more comfortable kick but
don't<00:00:45.629> mistake<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:47.340> less<00:00:47.969> performing

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
don't mistake that for a less performing

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
don't mistake that for a less performing
fin<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> channel<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.399> form<00:00:50.789> more

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fin because if the channel can form more

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.540 
fin because if the channel can form more
easily<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.050> displace<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.800> water<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
easily you displace more water in the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
easily you displace more water in the
proper<00:00:53.940> direction<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.199> material<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
proper direction now this material is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
proper direction now this material is
the<00:00:55.949> result<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.489> technological<00:00:56.899> improvements

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the result of technological improvements

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
the result of technological improvements
and<00:00:58.050> therefore<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.070> makes<00:00:59.370> sense<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and therefore it makes sense that it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
and therefore it makes sense that it
comes<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.930> point<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.469> an

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
comes out at this point as an

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
comes out at this point as an
improvement<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> fin<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.879> before

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
improvement of what the fin was before

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
improvement of what the fin was before
and<00:01:04.049> since<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.799> came<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.430> new

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and since we came out with this new

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
and since we came out with this new
version<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> Avanti<00:01:07.200> Quattro<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.770> decided

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
version of the Avanti Quattro we decided
to<00:01:08.430> spiffy<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.810> everywhere

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to spiffy it up a little bit everywhere

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.090 
to spiffy it up a little bit everywhere

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
we also introduced three new colors to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
we also introduced three new colors to
actually<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.259> new<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.829> used<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
actually not so new because we used to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.550 
actually not so new because we used to
have<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.299> welcome<00:01:31.170> return<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have them but it's a welcome return to

the line the lime and the Flamingo and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
the line the lime and the Flamingo and
then<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> white<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> special<00:01:36.780> about

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
then the white now what is special about

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
then the white now what is special about
these<00:01:37.320> colors<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.939> visibility<00:01:39.630> in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
these colors think about visibility in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
these colors think about visibility in
the<00:01:40.229> water<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.070> buddies<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> be

able to see you well this red is the
unlikeliest<00:01:45.840> red<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.770> ever<00:01:47.009> come

unlikeliest red that you would ever come

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
unlikeliest red that you would ever come
up<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.140> red<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.439> the

up with because we know that red is the
first<00:01:49.710> color<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.220> disappear<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:50.970> water<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
first color to disappear under water and

bright shiny red white is by all means

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.170 
bright shiny red white is by all means
the<00:01:59.430> easiest<00:02:00.149> color<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.630> spot<00:02:00.930> underwater<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
the easiest color to spot underwater and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.170 
the easiest color to spot underwater and
green<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.960> very<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.619> visible<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
green is also very very visible more so

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.260 
green is also very very visible more so
towards<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> surface<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.399> depth<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.060> a
