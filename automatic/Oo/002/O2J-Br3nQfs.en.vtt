00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello and welcome never love 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
 to a new race you're wondering 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.940
 maybe why I'm here right now 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.300
 pony run stand and not in it yamaha 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 actually the race would continue 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.940
 I have on the paddock island 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.109
 but now unlocked 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 I do not have that myself yet 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.470
 experience in it that I now without 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.930
 hey there could say bad 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 I can give you tips 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 that 's why I decided that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.590
 ponies have run the pony champion 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.590
 first preferable 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.500
 you see she is now level 8 there 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.879
 still a lot of air up 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 but I'm always too lazy to do it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.289
 if they are other ferry have so 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 Here we can look nice on the inside 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.809
 line hold slope left we can do so 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 save this is a small one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.670
 small time savings but I mean 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 Small cattle are also crap 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 We are already trying to go straight ahead 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.170
 hold and enter this entry into this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 wood barriers to look great 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 I also comply directly 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 little left always not at first 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.530
 so far to be held in the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.400
 line is always the shortest way 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.970
 we can jump here, too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.970
 save again 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 and now I can easily 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.119
 Keep right because it is now in 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.579
 I almost have a right turn 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.710
 done right here and there you go 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.570
 again to the left and to the beach so 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 I keep right around in left 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.600
 take the turn as close as possible 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.659
 can and that was already the pony 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 I hope I could give you a few 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.250
 give tips on the way, even if 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.899
 you can not abbreviate that much here and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.159
 then we'll see you next 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.159
 pony championat
