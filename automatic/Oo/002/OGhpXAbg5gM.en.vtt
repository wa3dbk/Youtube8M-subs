really<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.909> good<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.500> pretty<00:01:43.680> safe

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
really really good so it's pretty safe

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.859 
really really good so it's pretty safe
to<00:01:43.920> say<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.399> read<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.030> black<00:01:45.240> ops<00:01:45.360> 2<00:01:45.570> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to say that i read on black ops 2 just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.600 
to say that i read on black ops 2 just
as<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.439> rage<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.009> every<00:01:47.310> ailment<00:01:47.460> call

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
as much as I rage on every ailment call

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.320 
as much as I rage on every ailment call
of<00:01:47.820> duty

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
of duty

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.240 
of duty
so<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.720> guess<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.200> go<00:01:50.260> over<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.500> few<00:01:50.770> pros<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
so I guess I can go over a few pros and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.490 
so I guess I can go over a few pros and
cons<00:01:51.520> about<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> game<00:01:52.150> so<00:01:52.390> far<00:01:52.570> remember<00:01:53.320> it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
cons about the game so far remember it's

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.560 
cons about the game so far remember it's
only<00:01:53.619> been<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:53.920> for<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.220> few<00:01:54.280> days<00:01:54.520> now<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:55.210> my

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
only been out for a few days now so my

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.240 
only been out for a few days now so my
pains<00:01:55.869> on<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.350> will<00:01:56.530> most<00:01:56.710> likely<00:01:56.890> change

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
pains on it will most likely change

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.510 
pains on it will most likely change
depending<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:57.850> how<00:01:58.360> they<00:01:58.509> patch<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.900> game<00:01:59.020> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
depending on how they patch the game I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.460 
depending on how they patch the game I
like<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.820> pic<00:02:01.030> 10<00:02:01.299> create<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> class<00:02:01.840> system<00:02:02.049> it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
like the pic 10 create a class system it

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.899 
like the pic 10 create a class system it
was<00:02:02.680> something<00:02:03.040> new<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.549> they<00:02:03.580> brought<00:02:03.850> to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
was something new that they brought to

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.120 
was something new that they brought to
call<00:02:04.150> of<00:02:04.300> duty<00:02:04.509> but<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.440> worked<00:02:05.649> out<00:02:05.800> very<00:02:05.860> well

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
call of duty but it worked out very well

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.889 
call of duty but it worked out very well
and<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.700> wasn't<00:02:07.000> game-breaking<00:02:07.509> at<00:02:07.750> all

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
and it wasn't game-breaking at all

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.740 
and it wasn't game-breaking at all
surprisingly<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.860> like<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.819> overall<00:02:09.940> feel<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
surprisingly I like the overall feel the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.930 
surprisingly I like the overall feel the
game<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.170> feels<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:11.590> smooth<00:02:12.340> sprinting

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
game it feels very smooth sprinting

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
game it feels very smooth sprinting
strafing<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.630> jumping<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.170> get<00:02:14.680> decent<00:02:14.890> frames

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
strafing and jumping I get decent frames

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.190 
strafing and jumping I get decent frames
and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.730> haven't<00:02:16.150> noticed<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.660> drop<00:02:16.900> at<00:02:17.050> all

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and I haven't noticed and drop at all

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.130 
and I haven't noticed and drop at all
when<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.650> play<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.970> thing<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.020> get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
when I play but one thing I have to get

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.600 
when I play but one thing I have to get
used<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.440> though<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.040> being<00:02:21.280> able<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
used to though is not being able to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.000 
used to though is not being able to
remain<00:02:21.970> sprinting<00:02:22.630> after<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.110> jump<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.560> guess

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
remain sprinting after you jump I guess

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.740 
remain sprinting after you jump I guess
all<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.610> crybabies<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.480> scream

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
all the little crybabies you scream

bunny hopper because I can't hit a
moving<00:02:27.459> target<00:02:27.790> finally<00:02:28.540> got<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:28.870> they

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
moving target finally got what they

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.650 
moving target finally got what they
wanted<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:30.000> still<00:02:31.000> haven't<00:02:31.180> figured<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
wanted I still haven't figured out the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.920 
wanted I still haven't figured out the
best<00:02:31.959> gun<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.290> each<00:02:32.650> class<00:02:33.150> every<00:02:34.150> SMG<00:02:34.630> feels

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
best gun in each class every SMG feels

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.420 
best gun in each class every SMG feels
the<00:02:35.050> same<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.739> course<00:02:36.069> with<00:02:36.220> minor

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the same of course with minor

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.759 
the same of course with minor
differences<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.209> damage<00:02:37.630> fire<00:02:37.900> raised<00:02:38.170> recoil

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
differences in damage fire raised recoil

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.460 
differences in damage fire raised recoil
patterns<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.970> could<00:02:40.120> say<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.050> guns<00:02:41.290> are

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
patterns you could say that the guns are

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
patterns you could say that the guns are
balanced<00:02:42.370> idea<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.940> with<00:02:43.060> air<00:02:43.180> quotes<00:02:43.450> in

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
balanced idea that with air quotes in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
balanced idea that with air quotes in
this<00:02:43.959> aspect<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.860> can't<00:02:45.190> pick<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.580> gun<00:02:45.880> that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
this aspect but I can't pick a gun that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970 
this aspect but I can't pick a gun that
will<00:02:46.480> always<00:02:46.900> out<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.290> another<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.830> same

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
will always out you another in the same

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.150 
will always out you another in the same
class<00:02:48.160> which<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.670> good<00:02:49.030> i<00:02:49.060> guess<00:02:49.450> i<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.890> how

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
class which is good i guess i like how

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.250 
class which is good i guess i like how
theater<00:02:51.850> mode<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.150> back<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.570> makes<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.230> very

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
theater mode is back it makes a very

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.350 
theater mode is back it makes a very
convenient<00:02:53.799> for<00:02:54.100> me<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.700> pull<00:02:54.910> out<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
convenient for me to just pull out a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.060 
convenient for me to just pull out a
game<00:02:55.690> play<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:55.900> record<00:02:56.110> commentary<00:02:56.739> over<00:02:56.829> it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
game play and record commentary over it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.949 
game play and record commentary over it
just<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.519> but<00:02:58.180> from<00:02:58.600> what<00:02:58.660> I've<00:02:58.930> seen

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
just like this but from what I've seen

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.890 
just like this but from what I've seen
so<00:02:59.320> far<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.190> basically<00:03:00.579> exactly<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.660> same

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
so far it's basically exactly the same

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.780 
so far it's basically exactly the same
as<00:03:02.170> black<00:03:02.410> ops<00:03:02.620> 1<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.190> modern<00:03:03.459> warfare<00:03:03.610> 3

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
as black ops 1 and modern warfare 3

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.180 
as black ops 1 and modern warfare 3
which<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.360> little<00:03:04.660> disappointing<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.470> also

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
which is a little disappointing I also

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
which is a little disappointing I also
played<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.610> one<00:03:07.360> game<00:03:07.570> in<00:03:07.750> particular<00:03:08.350> which

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
played a one game in particular which

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.890 
played a one game in particular which
was<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> complete<00:03:09.700> stomp<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.329> wanted<00:03:10.690> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
was a complete stomp and I wanted to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.530 
was a complete stomp and I wanted to
check<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> replay<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.860> because<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.940> wanted

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
check the replay of it because I wanted

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.420 
check the replay of it because I wanted
to<00:03:13.600> actually<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.590> gameplay<00:03:15.100> for<00:03:15.310> this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
to actually use that gameplay for this

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.360 
to actually use that gameplay for this
commentary<00:03:15.850> but<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.600> course<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.650> was<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.070> only

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
commentary but of course it was the only

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.729

about two seconds and then I got over it
um<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:38.810> like<00:03:39.810> how<00:03:39.989> they<00:03:40.109> actually<00:03:40.290> tried<00:03:40.739> to

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099

look<00:03:41.670> at<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.879> competitive<00:03:42.180> scene<00:03:42.629> by<00:03:42.840> getting

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
look at the competitive scene by getting

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.020 
look at the competitive scene by getting
in<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.349> shoutcast<00:03:43.590> mode<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.400> league<00:03:44.700> play

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
in a shoutcast mode and league play

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.280 
in a shoutcast mode and league play
which<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.359> thought<00:03:45.659> was<00:03:45.810> really<00:03:45.959> cool<00:03:46.230> because

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
which I thought was really cool because

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.110 
which I thought was really cool because
it<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.129> League<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.370> Legends<00:03:47.849> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it was just like League of Legends and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.000 
it was just like League of Legends and
starcraft<00:03:48.659> for<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.260> yellow<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.920> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
starcraft for you like it yellow and you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.649 
starcraft for you like it yellow and you
have<00:03:50.310> your<00:03:50.459> placement<00:03:50.849> games<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.269> puts<00:03:51.480> you

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
have your placement games and puts you

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.170 
have your placement games and puts you
in<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.959> ranking<00:03:52.260> system<00:03:52.579> but<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.670> sucks<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:54.000> bit

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
in a ranking system but it sucks a bit

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.179 
in a ranking system but it sucks a bit
on<00:03:54.329> PC<00:03:54.719> because<00:03:54.900> there's<00:03:55.260> nobody<00:03:55.469> ever<00:03:55.889> in

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
on PC because there's nobody ever in

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.220 
on PC because there's nobody ever in
league<00:03:56.459> play<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:57.060> everybody<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.870> plays

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
league play and everybody just plays

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.920 
league play and everybody just plays
public<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:59.549> game<00:03:59.730> does<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.090> potential<00:04:00.750> to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
public the game does have potential to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.110 
public the game does have potential to
go<00:04:01.260> competitive<00:04:02.040> i<00:04:02.159> think<00:04:02.400> but<00:04:02.669> it's<00:04:02.849> hard<00:04:03.030> to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
go competitive i think but it's hard to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.610 
go competitive i think but it's hard to
say<00:04:03.239> right<00:04:03.419> now<00:04:03.480> if<00:04:03.720> i'm<00:04:03.840> even<00:04:04.049> going<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.470> play

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
say right now if i'm even going to play

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.770 
say right now if i'm even going to play
competitive<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.669> kind<00:04:05.909> of<00:04:05.970> depends<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.480> how

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
competitive it kind of depends on how

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.420 
competitive it kind of depends on how
the<00:04:06.840> game<00:04:07.200> turns<00:04:07.650> out<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:08.010> i<00:04:08.040> said<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.370> only
