00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.239
 so now I leave you tutor you there 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270
 we see immediately after with mine 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.190
 impressions let's see what he did 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.320
 Start by applying jobs or clear 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 shimmer on the inside corner 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.240
 on the mobile eyelid I extend the brown 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.240
 clear 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.470
 on the outside corner I apply a gray 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:47.000
 in the crease of the eye I apply clumsy 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.000
 gold which is a golden beige 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.740
 on the arch, eyebrows like 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.740
 illuminant I apply a light beige 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 I apply a mix on the lower eyelid 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:14.520
 of gray and brown as an eyeliner 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.520
 using mulan's precision eyeliner 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.609
 the pencil is the dark chocolate of graf 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.760
 toby I apply it to the rhyme 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.760
 lower 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.460
 I forgot to register the part in 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.130
 which I apply the manga mascara of 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.970
 the oreal and false eyelashes are her como 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.970
 nick of aso flash 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.450
 fills the eyebrows with the blog 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.420
 paola powder for eyebrows and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.420
 debon and this is light brown 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.850
 the lip pencil and the number 67 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:27.030
 diego from the palm and is resistant 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:31.160
 to the water on the lips plico buenos 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.160
 aires of ny ex 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.510
 and finally the blanar of mulan 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.019
 and this is the final result then 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.420
 what do I think this to get out of these 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.180
 leaflets was a big job I have to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.879
 say here are the different looks that you 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.459
 they can also recreate it 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.150
 mirror there is the double applicator da 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 one part there is the sponge but on the other 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.360
 the brush is also used 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.859
 what I think traditional 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.340
 above all they are all 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.989
 gilbert colors that in short if you there 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.880
 like the shimmer colors if you 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.780
 wait if you are looking for a news blade 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.600
 for a very very natural make-up and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.070
 opaque or for every day though 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.570
 this fact even if you choose not 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.610
 means it's not for every day 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.560
 this is certainly not the case because 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.530
 in fact all the colors within 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.370
 eye shadows have a shimmer finish whatsoever 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.669
 I think I find it not bad at all 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.260
 the colors are not incredibly 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:53.010
 pigmented are medium pigmented there 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.289
 are my favorite colors is that me 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.470
 especially like the colors 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.080
 the brighter they are very very nice they have 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.360
 really very beautiful shades and 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.570
 then there are also the darker colors 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.599
 which are made are not really much 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.169
 dark but I find that they are not bad of 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.740
 new as usual is a small spoon 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.310
 economic have done this 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.360
 carton allow six in the end 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.430
 small colors and therefore if in short it is not 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.879
 takes up quite a bit of space for the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.879
 content that there is yes maybe you need 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:36.270
 apply not two but three times 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.669
 I can't find the eyeshadow, though 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.139
 I find it not as bad as how 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.620
 spoon above all considering the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:48.120
 price the lipstick this shade is 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.110
 very pretty but this shade of the gods 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.289
 software I have seen several in 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.629
 this last time very nice me 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.610
 really like it, I find it very soft 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.669
 and this really slips very well 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.169
 morning by diego dalla palma and what else 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.990
 the blush very beautiful this shade 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.029
 really beautiful and a is a coral e 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.689
 I find it perfect on a skin 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:19.580
 tanned already I imagine it beautiful and 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:25.349
 it is a matt effect and has a matte finish 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:28.469
 the last thing the eyeliner mules bad gifts 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:31.529
 it is one and the penalty therefore easy tender 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:35.039
 however to be applied to a tip also 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:38.520
 rather rigid that allows 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.860
 even a precise application without 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.080
 smudge dries even faster better 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.029
 therefore he is not at all badly initiated 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.240
 to use this was the first 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:50.550
 tutorial where I used it and it is 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.510
 all so I hope this tutorial 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.520
 you enjoyed this trick 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.520
 before not of the entity in peace ciao
