00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 the people who play today express I will 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 teach how to draw a shark 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 Here I have an apex 2b and 4b, 16 b 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.879
 a sheet sulphite a4 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.220
 I'll start drawing the sketch. 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.890
 usually I do with 32 babies but to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 you can see doing with 4 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.080
 the first thing to do is make a kibbe 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.880
 one of them is what happened to me was 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 The difference is that you will be well. 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 more than normal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 that way at the tip you get a little 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:39.350
 more when will the right tail leave a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350
 little thinner 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:02:09.149
 now let's draw and tango 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:02:12.019
 here you follow the line in the middle behind the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.019
 other 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:24.500
 now you will draw bring bigger 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.900
 underneath you also do another one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.900
 smaller 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:46.319
 Now you do another one, another one. 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.989
 two goals here work to start 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:55.880
 to draw to setÃºbal 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:03:03.650
 Now you take in half of them in view 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.650
 that the body where the eyes will be 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.180
 under the eye 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.290
 you make the mouth 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.290
 only a curved line 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.500
 people flip flops and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.500
 draw wars 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 like this 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.810
 The full outline is now ready for you. 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:43.319
 pick up a pencil or pick it up 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.319
 to bypass 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.170
 ah 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.400
 here snout nib you will draw 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.400
 something like this here 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.140
 and continued to control its design 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:24.360
 of this chip spree in the last battle 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.880
 fin that is the oar of it you go 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.480
 work around a curve well in the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.920
 start at the end you 'll draw some 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.680
 thing to do with it 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:46.650
 I do not know exactly when 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.140
 draws what motivated the outline is 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.050
 ready 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:05:00.110
 now let's make the sum a support 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:04.040
 be here shaded it will be underneath it 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.040
 you talk like that 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.400
 on the back at the bottom of it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:32.640
 a basic shade just to let the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:35.780
 example so different view of the test 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.780
 from bahrain and I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.890
 that's it, her house is all
