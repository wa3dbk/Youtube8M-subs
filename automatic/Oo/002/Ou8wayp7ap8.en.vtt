00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
significance right now but let me

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.540 
significance right now but let me
explain<00:00:07.049> its<00:00:07.319> meaning<00:00:07.529> there<00:00:08.099> are<00:00:08.130> two

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
explain its meaning there are two

dominance<00:00:19.230> well<00:00:19.770> that's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.580> much

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
dominance well that's a little much

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.109 
dominance well that's a little much
isn't<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:22.260> got<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> better<00:00:22.890> idea<00:00:23.119> there

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
isn't it I've got a better idea there

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
isn't it I've got a better idea there
that's<00:00:24.960> much<00:00:25.260> better

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that's much better

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
that's much better
now<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.849> further<00:00:27.119> explain<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
now we can further explain right and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
now we can further explain right and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
numbers and reasoning all right I think

numbers and reasoning all right I think
it's<00:02:57.090> time<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.570> move<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.200> right<00:02:58.350> brain

so<00:03:02.310> let's<00:03:02.850> take<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.330> one<00:03:03.390> step<00:03:03.660> at<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.200> time<00:03:04.320> if

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
so let's take this one step at a time if

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.370 
so let's take this one step at a time if
the<00:03:05.670> left<00:03:05.940> brain<00:03:06.239> takes<00:03:06.570> things<00:03:06.930> logically

ways<00:04:21.600> that's<00:04:22.600> right<00:04:23.010> well<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.280> suppose<00:04:24.700> those

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
ways that's right well I suppose those

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.180 
ways that's right well I suppose those
are<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.630> basics<00:04:26.080> about<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.410> right<00:04:26.800> brain

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:49.859 

it's<00:04:48.039> important<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.789> note<00:04:48.999> that<00:04:49.029> the<00:04:49.360> sides<00:04:49.629> of

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:49.869 
it's important to note that the sides of

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:50.450 
it's important to note that the sides of

the brain are

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.180 
the brain are
not<00:04:50.550> totally<00:04:50.850> fixed<00:04:51.800> sometimes<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:53.009> math

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
not totally fixed sometimes a math

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.520 
not totally fixed sometimes a math

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
problem can require both formulas and a

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.379 
problem can require both formulas and a
creative<00:04:56.039> spin<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.550> solve<00:04:56.819> it<00:04:57.030> correctly
