00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.019
 Hello, very often 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.880
 Guitar does not build cho for garbage like 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 Total 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 set up as it should be on the fifth fret here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.539
 all a t t t t t t everything is fine all by 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.160
 the tuner 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.160
 everything is fine we start to play 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:36.920
 no sound builds and all guitar in 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:40.870
 what's the deal but there may be no options 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.880
 so many first option 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.070
 the scale is not adjusted this here 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.379
 the distance from this powder here to this 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:57.489
 how is he how is she governed is 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:01.489
 the distance is necessary on the tuner 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.150
 set up for example the first old all 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.590
 pol on the tuner, it gives us an arrow 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 everything is in the center everything is fine 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 then floor strings on the twelfth year 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.369
 and see that the arrow was also on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 to the center if the string is an arrow 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.280
 rolls over came out sounds mean mentura 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.050
 need to lengthen 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.930
 that is, on this string here 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.430
 bolt is 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.909
 adjustment here adjustment bolt 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.600
 and while extending it slightly twisted 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.410
 surrendered moved here in this direction 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 slightly lengthened 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:57.929
 back to set up a open string batyu 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.690
 people arrow exactly back click 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:06.899
 on the twelfth year we look 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.899
 we have an arrow, for example, again too much 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 going wild means little unscrewed means 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.260
 on the country the string above sounds so here 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.180
 this distance is insufficient 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 make it even longer move aside 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.320
 this thing and so back then we build 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.720
 open 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.890
 again we pull on 12 twelfth year in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.680
 As a result, we should open 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 Arrow stand exactly on the twelfth 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.190
 year, just as the arrow should be 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.920
 exactly then we have a scale 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.290
 adjusted correctly and the same 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.290
 do the same stuff on every string 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.090
 so the scale is regulated on each 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.300
 string so everything is clear but if you 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.220
 the arrow on the contrary did not reach means 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:22.100
 you had a misperception 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:24.410
 short and long was like a string 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.130
 sounded below means the opposite should have been 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.560
 move here well I understand the arrow 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.970
 the center should be open on what 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.670
 on the 12th fret and twist these twists 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:45.170
 This is the first option when the second scale 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:47.239
 the version of the scale is adjusted it all 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.010
 us ok but still somehow sounds 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:57.709
 not so what's the matter but it can be 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:01.549
 the height of the strings above the waters if you have a throne 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.769
 and too high above the waters when 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.570
 here you press a string 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.900
 she bends too far and tom 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.760
 the strings rise as it is stronger 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.720
 pulling because of this no longer sounds 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 Well, the third rare very rare option 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:30.250
 occurs but meets all the same at 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.820
 I've met this once in my life 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.260
 when the factory do the guitar 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:43.940
 there the machine is set to immediately set 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.990
 some well all for example 24 frets or 22 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.689
 who has how much it costs 12 in and 24 cutters 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.489
 they are both 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:58.860
 cut all the grooves on the neck under the water and 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:05:03.969
 here somehow in this time neck 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.059
 moved here or here and the cutter about hero 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.959
 what are these grooves 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:13.089
 water there to enter the grooves shut up 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:19.649
 she is not visible then you can move 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:24.729
 but a millimeter can 2 zahrachili all 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:28.649
 normal water on the spot so 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:32.139
 normal on the 12th fret for normal 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:37.689
 all tuner shows perfectly 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:41.619
 and when you start to play does not sound like 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:45.039
 as if the guitar is upset 

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:46.239
 shifted get all the water in 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.259
 any side 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:53.279
 it's not just some kind of watt, but all because 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:57.009
 that they crawl through them simultaneously in a factory 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:06:00.759
 there is only one option here 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:05.039
 fix put another fingerboard of another 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:09.249
 there is simply no option or on this sin 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:12.610
 change the cover with all the frets it 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:16.869
 you have to go guitar master so that you 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:20.019
 changed the cover plate entirely by the charter already with 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:23.439
 correctly drank us grooves under 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:27.039
 water that's all ways 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:30.849
 Venia case when the guitar does not build 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:34.479
 or scale or string height too 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:42.659
 most or all frets are shifted court or 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:42.659
 well, that's all thank you for watching
