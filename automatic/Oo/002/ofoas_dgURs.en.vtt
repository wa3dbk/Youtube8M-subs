00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Re-salute you in a free throw 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 France was preparing to play matches 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 The final round of the FIFA World Cup 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 At the same time it was Paris 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Hosts the online gaming tournament 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And the third football 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Which was attended by more than 800 players 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 From more than 50 countries 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Paris hosted the world championship 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 For computer games 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 With more than 50 countries participating 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Today there are electronic games in the world 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 But many Pro Evolution Soccer game 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Have a special flavor in the context 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 The advantage of the World Cup finals in Germany 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 This game is the European reserve 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Winnig Ilven 9 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 And famous in the Gulf States of the Japanese league 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Is the best simulation game 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 The real football at all 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Last year saw a start 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Strong Saudi Arabia 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 With the victory of player Bader Hakim 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Known as Arabian Joker 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 In the world championship last year 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Badr: In our talents in Saudi Arabia 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 It is normal 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 I mean the game is famous in Saudi Arabia 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 And beloved to all 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Three quarters of the Saudi people play it 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And let it not be for as long as the whole people are playing the game 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Why not achieve the championship, God willing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It is what they do, but they do 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 The speed is amazing and the concentration and calm nerves 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And of course skills 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 God willing, we have it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Bader Hakim pulled out this time 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 From the competition because the lottery imposed on him 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Face an Israeli player 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 A lot of proof stands in the face of the Arab players 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Who closed the French adventure doors 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 In their faces because the French consulates 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Visas were not granted to all players 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Who were invited 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Best player in Egypt 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Because I know you get a visa from the French Embassy 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Unfortunately they were very abusive to us 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The Consul in Egypt is not a sincere servant 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Ali Nab is the best player 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And all men know Him, even we are all bewildered 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Because we were expecting that if he had been doing it would have been an achievement 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It is possible to win the championship and the release of the Magash 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Khalid Ali is Water Mellon No. 14 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 On the server at the Wurcraft Web site 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 He takes the visa 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 The problem is Bia Di, but Jimgers and Kbutchenl 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 In Egypt ... Compuitions are already doing their work 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 The costume of Giga Bet made the kings of the games and Keda 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 We have every need available, all need mojad thank god 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 These games were imposed in the Arab region 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 The players' circle is constantly expanding 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 But have begun to organize strongly 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 This is one of the factors that nominated the player 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Kuwaiti Bender Al Mutairi to win second place 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 The whole Middle East is represented here 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 It was supervised by a Saudi official, Yasser Bahgat 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Yasir: The football game of Winn-Alien or the European version of it 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Pro Evolution is almost 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 More widespread than any other need in the kingdom by statistics 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 We have at least four million to seven million players playing 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 The game in Saudi Arabia alone 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Arab presence is not limited to the Orient 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Morocco also has its own athletes 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Video games are spreading rapidly in Algeria, for example 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 It's our problem with the players 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 We have so many players God bless 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 But the C-shape means you know 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 My consol Diego is this ecclesiastical 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 It is necessary if a lot of money is provided by man 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 The machines you need for this players 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 If we are now seeking 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 To be with us 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Subsidies to our economies 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 With Nzidou, the rumor is bigger 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And more come for this 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 This type of sport 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 A few weeks ago he announced an opening 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 First European Treatment Center 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Addicted to video games in the Netherlands 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 There is no risk-free sports game 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 So the defenders of these games say 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 They prefer the World Cup for e-sports 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Rather than video games 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 The Arab players imposed themselves in these games 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But they do not feel officially recognized 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Real in their own countries 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Their message if clear 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Video Games sport the most meaning of the word 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
