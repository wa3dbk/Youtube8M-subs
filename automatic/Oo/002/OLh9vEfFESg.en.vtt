00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to good use you want to collect those

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170 
to good use you want to collect those
little<00:02:34.500> bonus<00:02:34.950> medals<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.730> quickly<00:02:36.000> as

little bonus medals as quickly as

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.090 
little bonus medals as quickly as
possible<00:02:36.630> because<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.200> miss<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.500> they<00:02:37.920> go

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
possible because if you miss one they go

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.220 
possible because if you miss one they go
back<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> starting<00:02:39.090> value<00:02:39.480> 100<00:02:40.200> points

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.640 

visually<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> don't<00:03:28.420> think<00:03:28.660> Guardian<00:03:29.080> force<00:03:29.380> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
visually I don't think Guardian force is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.190 
visually I don't think Guardian force is
the<00:03:29.920> most<00:03:30.130> exciting<00:03:30.700> Sega<00:03:31.120> Saturn<00:03:31.540> vertically

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the most exciting Sega Saturn vertically

scrolling spaceship style shooter and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.840 
scrolling spaceship style shooter and
the<00:03:35.170> music<00:03:35.500> seems<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:35.860> little<00:03:35.980> bit<00:03:36.190> strange<00:03:36.460> to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the music seems a little bit strange to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.330 
the music seems a little bit strange to
me<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.120> well<00:03:37.300> but<00:03:37.510> that's<00:03:37.750> subjective<00:03:38.590> what's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
me as well but that's subjective what's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.700 
me as well but that's subjective what's
really<00:03:39.790> good<00:03:40.000> here<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.480> gameplay

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
balanced and a lot of fun because it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.120 
balanced and a lot of fun because it's
just<00:03:46.870> different<00:03:46.960> enough<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.560> set<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.010> apart

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
just different enough to set it apart

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.400
