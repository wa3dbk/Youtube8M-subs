it all together I wouldn't do that
actually<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.030> got<00:05:41.330> this<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:41.780> just<00:05:42.080> straight-up

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
actually I got this to just straight-up

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.440 
actually I got this to just straight-up
wear<00:05:42.889> like<00:05:43.250> as<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.460> shirt<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.000> I<00:05:44.060> probably<00:05:44.210> put

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
wear like as a shirt and I probably put

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.820 
wear like as a shirt and I probably put
like<00:05:44.479> a<00:05:44.599> little<00:05:44.660> blazer<00:05:44.990> or<00:05:45.260> something<00:05:45.560> over

like a little blazer or something over
it<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.190> I<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:46.910> would<00:05:47.060> be
