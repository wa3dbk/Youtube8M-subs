in<00:00:53.769> this<00:00:53.920> case<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.249> can<00:00:54.609> use<00:00:54.639> a<00:00:54.789> laser<00:00:55.089> cutter

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
in this case you can use a laser cutter

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.989 
in this case you can use a laser cutter
to<00:00:56.109> etch<00:00:56.289> away<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.710> tape<00:00:57.010> creating<00:00:57.609> a<00:00:57.699> far

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
to etch away the tape creating a far

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.389 
to etch away the tape creating a far
more<00:00:58.239> intricate<00:00:58.629> pattern<00:00:59.190> since<00:01:00.190> we're

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
more intricate pattern since we're

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.430 
more intricate pattern since we're
making<00:01:00.729> something<00:01:00.999> so<00:01:01.449> quite<00:01:01.749> detailed<00:01:02.139> as<00:01:02.409> a

here you can clearly see the exposed

etched away for the next step we will

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.960 
etched away for the next step we will
need<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.159> cups<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> water

the<00:01:32.159> amount<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> salt<00:01:32.970> isn't<00:01:33.479> super<00:01:33.899> critical

the amount of salt isn't super critical

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
the amount of salt isn't super critical
just<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.280> sure<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.850> add<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.299> quite<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
