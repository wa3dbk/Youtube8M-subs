00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
really busy with a graduate school work

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.280 
really busy with a graduate school work
another<00:04:17.489> big<00:04:17.880> due<00:04:18.060> date<00:04:18.270> on<00:04:18.480> monday<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:19.260> a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
another big due date on monday for a

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.400 
another big due date on monday for a
bunch<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.650> things

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
bunch of things

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.040 
bunch of things
then<00:04:21.620> yeah<00:04:22.400> it's<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.180> recurring<00:04:23.570> thing<00:04:23.870> so

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
then yeah it's a recurring thing so

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.900 
then yeah it's a recurring thing so
that's<00:04:24.110> it's<00:04:24.320> going<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.500> keep<00:04:24.590> happening<00:04:24.910> but

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
that's it's going to keep happening but

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.800 
that's it's going to keep happening but
this<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.090> probably<00:04:26.270> how<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.540> game<00:04:26.780> should

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
this is probably how the game should

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.260 
this is probably how the game should
have<00:04:27.230> played<00:04:28.010> out<00:04:28.220> with<00:04:28.490> whence<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.880> pelicans

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
have played out with whence the pelicans

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.300 
have played out with whence the pelicans
vs<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.660> Cavs<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:32.440> played<00:04:33.440> terrible<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.220> my

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310

first time playing a basketball game in

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.270 
first time playing a basketball game in
probably<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.200> two<00:04:36.530> days<00:04:36.740> because<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.100> did

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
probably like two days because I did

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.710 
probably like two days because I did
that<00:04:37.430> next<00:04:37.730> car<00:04:37.880> if<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.030> game<00:04:38.390> thing

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
remember the reviews how they said that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.810 
remember the reviews how they said that
you<00:04:44.150> couldn't<00:04:44.300> get<00:04:44.480> any<00:04:44.660> fouls<00:04:44.990> in<00:04:45.290> this<00:04:45.410> game

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
you couldn't get any fouls in this game
