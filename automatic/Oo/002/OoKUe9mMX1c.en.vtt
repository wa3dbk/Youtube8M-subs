00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.220
 Now I show them how to make their names 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.350
 donate for cutting 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 to prepare 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.030
 First remove like the protective cover 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.550
 then we free the ham from the 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.539
 deepens on its surface 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.539
 has formed 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 now we should decide and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 cut some if necessary 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 the outer as for example in thin 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 white plaque or part of the fat 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.370
 the slightly yellowish color 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 have accepted away for this process 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.479
 No products like vinegar 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.399
 used after we send that 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.449
 we can have a part cleaned 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.449
 remove the wait 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.729
 but beware the black protects in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.410
 camp and may therefore never completely 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.740
 who only at the interface as far as 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.820
 necessary to be cut away under the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 Sparte is the field at 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 We are allowed to relax the whole field 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:31.700
 cut away but always leave one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.700
 layer exist like this 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 because the fat gives the fans give 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 its typical sweet and fragrant and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.030
 taste is worth mentioning as well 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.700
 that the fat of the parma ham to almost 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.280
 70 percent of unsaturated fatty acids 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.070
 exists and is characterized by a low 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 Highlight cholesterol content now 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.820
 after the division and part of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.430
 We were able to remove the grease layer 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.490
 apply the chic cut thereby 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.310
 three main rules regulate the rule 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.730
 never really never thought with the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.230
 be cut open 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.149
 Always cut these into the before 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.190
 Area away for the cutout 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.480
 is provided 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.070
 second rule cut the arm 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.080
 do not send in until you have them 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.220
 customer demands and avoid that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320
 slices of air too long 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.910
 are exposed 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.740
 cut the chic and up to the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.730
 Place the sale in the refrigerated counter 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.560
 absolutely wrong 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.630
 the slices would become dry 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.370
 change your color we send 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.720
 the salts become and its unique 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.940
 lose flavor 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.770
 which is parma ham ne completely different 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.330
 rear or no preservation and 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.340
 contain no dyes 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.730
 he is therefore with a larger one 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.680
 Be careful to handle the third rule 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.650
 Slices have to be thin as thin as 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.310
 possible because both will send parma 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.230
 with the slicer 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.120
 just cut those 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 desired wafer - thin slices possible 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.040
 won both hand and electric 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.110
 operated are the most suitable 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.840
 a rail with vertical knife 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.410
 a diameter of at least 30 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.080
 centimeter 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 Well, now we'll send him out 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.540
 the slicer and set the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.670
 no one cuts for optimal slices 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140
 achieve 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.880
 see a main and the disc 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 with a pleasant white fat 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.100
 Look well the color of the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.720
 slice of red roses has to be the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.130
 the typical adolf place are send 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.049
 unlike the color of others 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.850
 because she is natural 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.730
 which is due to the fact that the 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.100
 panic no dyes or others 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.330
 contain additives 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.420
 if the disc for example a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.900
 has blood stain or the layer money 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.790
 this part has to be send directly from 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.450
 will be removed with the following 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.250
 slices to be flawless 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.470
 a white and sacred spot in the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.990
 slice is no mistake 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.230
 it is about the raisins one 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.750
 of protein stood during the 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.520
 matured and crystallized in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.810
 the long we afford ham normal 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.540
 The slices are being on a sheet 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.950
 Food paper rejected but not 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.760
 over each other but partially 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.640
 overlap 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.530
 just as it avoids them 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.870
 adhere to each other between the individual 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.680
 ham lay a thin foil 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.540
 be placed 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.760
 that can give up to the wine 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.850
 be cut open more or less 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 until here then it is impossible beautiful 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.330
 to get thin slices 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.660
 however, the proportion of the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.400
 beins still be used 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.960
 sliced in thick slices and in 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.200
 cut cubes or fine strips 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.520
 we can use them for cooking 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.260
 and we can do that for ourselves 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.080
 Use delicious meat broth 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.410
 As a rule, only the parmaschinken 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.880
 with bones of the hand cut to 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.920
 example to reach for an appetizer 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.310
 this requires a ham holder 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.720
 and a long thin knife us 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.700
 so start the lard 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.430
 to remove the fat layer 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.670
 give outer protect then cut 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.050
 we the fray away 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.120
 unlike the one shown previously in 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.860
 give both where we at the bottom part 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.520
 beginning we start cutting 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.350
 by hand at the side of giving us 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.240
 So try thin slices with one 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.710
 to cut down fat layer because 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.250
 the fat gives the partner to send 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.810
 its typical sweet taste 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.850
 this way we cut gradually 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.800
 parallel and evenly the slices 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.550
 down to the bone while cooking 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.680
 arrived 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.570
 Let's turn the tenth and cut the 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.530
 slices in the same way 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.530
 down the other side
