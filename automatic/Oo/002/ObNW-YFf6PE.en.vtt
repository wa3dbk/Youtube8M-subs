D<00:00:15.570> amplifier<00:00:16.250> because<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.490> people<00:00:17.789> like

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
D amplifier because a lot of people like

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.599 
D amplifier because a lot of people like
to<00:00:17.940> say<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.359> worthless<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.350> no<00:00:19.590> good

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
to say it's worthless and no good

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
to say it's worthless and no good
my<00:00:21.180> coils<00:00:21.600> read<00:00:21.840> perfect<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
my coils read perfect I have two of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.029 
my coils read perfect I have two of
these<00:00:24.060> amplifiers<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.840> picked<00:00:25.050> them<00:00:25.109> both<00:00:25.830> up

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
these amplifiers I picked them both up

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
these amplifiers I picked them both up
for<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.310> hundred<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> eighty<00:00:26.880> dollars<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
for one hundred and eighty dollars you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
for one hundred and eighty dollars you
can<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.900> brand<00:00:28.170> new<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.529> under<00:00:28.740> 120<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
can get them brand new for under 120 and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400 
can get them brand new for under 120 and
you<00:00:29.760> can't<00:00:30.060> beat<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.539> especially<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
you can't beat them especially for the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
you can't beat them especially for the
price<00:00:31.590> power<00:00:32.520> might<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.910> might<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.360> be

when<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.860> driving<00:00:56.100> normally<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.730> are

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
when I'm driving normally there are

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.189 
when I'm driving normally there are
right<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.379> box<00:00:58.590> I've<00:00:58.859> built<00:01:00.199> should

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
right this is the box I've built should

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.260 
right this is the box I've built should
be<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.770> between<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> 35<00:01:02.489> Hertz<00:01:02.820> should<00:01:03.120> be

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
be it's between the 35 Hertz should be

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.370 
be it's between the 35 Hertz should be
roughly<00:01:03.510> 1.25<00:01:04.409> cubes<00:01:04.890> per<00:01:05.189> sub<00:01:06.229> here's<00:01:07.229> my

here<00:01:35.090> my<00:01:36.090> demo<00:01:36.299> might<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> best<00:01:37.110> I'm

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
here my demo might not be the best I'm

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
here my demo might not be the best I'm
not<00:01:37.530> real<00:01:37.710> great<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.579> stuff

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
not real great with this kind of stuff

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
not real great with this kind of stuff
so<00:01:39.150> take<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:42.270> might<00:01:43.140> not

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
so take it for what it is I might not

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.450 
so take it for what it is I might not
even<00:01:43.290> choose<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.680> best<00:01:44.220> song<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
even choose the best song but here it is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
even choose the best song but here it is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
2500 D I'll post another one when I get

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.760 
2500 D I'll post another one when I get
my<00:01:52.439> second<00:01:52.740> amp<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.529 

one<00:02:00.770> more<00:02:00.950> thing<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.789> gain<00:02:02.000> on<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.360> amp

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
one more thing the the gain on the amp

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.450 
one more thing the the gain on the amp
is<00:02:02.750> about<00:02:02.899> 3/4<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.469> way<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.070> bass<00:02:04.219> boost

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
is about 3/4 the way up the bass boost

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.749 
is about 3/4 the way up the bass boost
is<00:02:04.729> about<00:02:04.909> 1/4<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.479> way<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.670> at

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
is about 1/4 of the way up I have it at
