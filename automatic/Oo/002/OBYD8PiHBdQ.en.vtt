00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.120
 guys with one of this new video 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.830
 finally video we say bargain on 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.120
 there is finally a flea market 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 went to the flea market of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.859
 valentia was so long since I wanted to go there 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 a great bargain is a pity 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.350
 in fact two big bargains and nothing 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.560
 guys keep us showing you why 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 however they are valuable pieces of the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.769
 collection 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.899
 first of all I recovered boys 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.550
 I get there and what I find there to do the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 really only video at the beginning 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 it came I didn't know if it could be filmed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.539
 so he said to better risk it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 the first deal we say I found is 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.399
 the fantastic playstation 1 indeed not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 you can see is not seal miss malice 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.270
 however it is a playstation move 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.059
 if I tell you the price I paid it does not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.579
 you will believe us first let's start from 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 fact that I don't know if it works not with cables 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.979
 however I will take cables later 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.170
 and if it works or not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.659
 I believe it can work but also 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.159
 if I am very doubtful about this fact it is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.770
 anything at first the girl makes me watching 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.540
 I 15 euros for this console 15 euros is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 too then talking about the plus and the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 less 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.820
 in the end he negotiated a little e 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 I arrived at 5 euros for 5 euros 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.280
 then I brought it home 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.470
 playstation 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.939
 one had a longing for this one 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.400
 amazing console guys why 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.380
 however it was my first console 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.119
 fixed and this was the first purchase 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.119
 obviously oh my God, obviously changing 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.119
 stalls 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.850
 places seeing here and there 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.210
 business that you could also meet 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 many games of tron pacman nes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 of the very rare I think it is rare 3 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.970
 EUR 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.520
 they just wanted that by not having the nes 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 I said well I find it so porteno 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 I will take it anyway soon 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.500
 very low prices 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.450
 obviously I couldn't take the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.800
 console without control she indeed is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.640
 also took the controller of the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.840
 playstation 1 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.520
 and who remembers it with this head 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.470
 mileage and this was another 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.030
 bargain guys because another always 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.740
 not the same stall I took the ps1 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.020
 it was another stall where I have 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.560
 found this joystick and asked for the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.670
 girl always from the veto 15 euros 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.690

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 contracting by contracting we say that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.060
 I'm pretty good at contacting them 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.730
 arrived at the modest sum of 3 euros e 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.290

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.709

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.220

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.500
