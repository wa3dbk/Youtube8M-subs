top clubs where we are we are still in
the<00:05:36.970> Champions<00:05:37.330> League<00:05:37.390> so<00:05:37.870> we<00:05:38.050> are<00:05:38.170> with<00:05:38.290> the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
the Champions League so we are with the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.400 
the Champions League so we are with the
last<00:05:38.560> 16<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.580> think<00:05:40.180> galatasaray<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.080> top

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410
