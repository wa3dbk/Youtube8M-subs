 here is the review of the cm storm headphones 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 pg 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.659
 an adjective to describe them perfectly 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.729
 nice guys i'm already not here 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.830
 with our first review on the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.019
 channel boys today we're going to review 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.610
 the master cm storm pc cooler headphones 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.970
 then guys, let's start by saying 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 that these fantastic earphones are 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.849
 been developed by the master cooler 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 of trezzano we go immediately to the wines 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.209
 start it for about 30 euros and how are you 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.150
 seeing here I was trying to open 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.000
 this but very slow box who is 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 I could not succeed in April as you succeed 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.450
 see these trust really small 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.360
 and simple 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.860
 in fact this this review of the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.310
 story of standing with the microphone of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.000
 these headphones because they really have a 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.769
 crazy microphone the community of these 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.950
 headphones that you are not always required to 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.569
 bring you the usual big headphones maybe 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.670
 which have the microphone because 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.150
 these are always good at the same 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.790
 way 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.709
 as you see in the box I found one 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.900
 show with a client of the cooler 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.350
 master always where we could put the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.750
 our headphones after a split that 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.230
 it is very useful for the desktop computer 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.560
 how much we can attack the jack of the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.040
 headphone jet receiver and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.950
 after we can double it with others with 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.930
 the attack that I was now unfortunately not 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.019
 sees well in the video camera but a 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.540
 audio connection and a microphone connection 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.400
 ok now i was seen but i take the headphones 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.620
 which are really well 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.849
 packed parades and guys what 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.290
 we can say of these fantastic ones 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:49.140
 Microphone headphones year entirely small 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.209
 it is somewhat we say exceptional they have 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.150
 on the left cuff for 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.459
 the accuracy is very small too 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.439
 very comfortable indeed in the ear 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.739
 later in the video I also show 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.599
 if there are small wines of the little ones 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.189
 adapters precisely for the ear from 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.739
 the smaller one to the larger one 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.780
 I had to put the smaller one 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.900
 the headphones are red and are 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.930
 very flamboyant for this I really am 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.139
 very liked and also another thing 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.660
 rather important is that they are wired 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.720
 in gold and this is what makes them much more 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.060
 fast and a lot we say performant from 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.710
 this point of view 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.780
 so what can we say about these 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.300
 headphones and now I'm showing 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.509
 exactly how they are made are small and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.440
 comfortable ear that go far 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.180
 very comfortable 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.039
 I was against this at first 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.530
 like we say about headphones when they are 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.840
 used to the big ones but trying her 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.539
 I realized that they are comfortable both 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.699
 to listen to music on my phone 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.190
 on your smartphone at the same time 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.270
 to record video and to listen to the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.830
 music on the computer 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.849
 what can we say about these headphones well 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.340
 they are very comfortable 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.900
 very comfortable indeed look here that 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.060
 have those children going into the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.960
 ears in which we have the measure la 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.000
 largest average and small and then 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.419
 oh well yes even here the box is a lot 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.979
 nice and very very cute guys 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.380
 what can we say about these headphones 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.240
 I think they are exceptional headphones 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.099
 from the cost of only 30 euros 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.930
 because if you don't want to answer, spend 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:30.300
 much for some headphones you could take 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.280
 these maybe you don't need headphones from 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.180
 serious gaming but you don't want to spend 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.610
 Much money 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.419
 you want to buy headphones that you 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.370
 they also give excellent sound both for 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.099
 as far as gaming audio is concerned 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.590
 audio as music itself and at the same 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.550
 long you want headphones with a great 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.060
 microphone 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.919
 well i recommend this 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.470
 because they are really headphones 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.639
 exceptional at only the price 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.889
 let's say 30 euros 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.410
 who leave you the master cooler link 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.550
 in which you can find all the headphones 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.500
 from the headphones mouse keyboards keys 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.360
 much cooler master objects boys 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.250
 for this review, I'll see you all 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.250
 in the next beautiful
