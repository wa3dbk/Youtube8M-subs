00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
UFOs are there to help with the healing

UFOs are there to help with the healing
now<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.600> happens<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.460> vine<00:00:39.020> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now this happens to be the vine that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.790 
now this happens to be the vine that
they<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.160> draw<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.570> ayahuasca<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.649> has

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
they use to draw the ayahuasca that has

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.520 
they use to draw the ayahuasca that has
the<00:00:44.040> DMT<00:00:44.640> molecule<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:49.079> remind<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the DMT molecule to remind you of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
the DMT molecule to remind you of
anything<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.309> intertwined<00:00:54.270> serpents

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
anything that the intertwined serpents

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.910 
anything that the intertwined serpents
the<00:00:55.710> DNA<00:00:56.160> molecule<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.410> led

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the DNA molecule and this is what led

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.150 
the DNA molecule and this is what led
Jeremy<00:00:59.460> narvi<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> conclude<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.949> what<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Jeremy narvi to conclude that what is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.870 
Jeremy narvi to conclude that what is
actually<00:01:02.520> happening<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.489> people<00:01:05.489> who

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
actually happening is that people who

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.539 
actually happening is that people who
the<00:01:06.119> shamans<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.549> communicating

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the shamans are actually communicating

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.980 
the shamans are actually communicating
with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> consciousness<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> DNA

codes from the 20 letters alphabet over

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
codes from the 20 letters alphabet over
here<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> four-letter<00:02:45.450> alphabet<00:02:45.660> over

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.110 
here and the four-letter alphabet over
here<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.510> somehow<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:49.549> translator<00:02:50.549> got<00:02:50.790> put<00:02:51.030> in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
here so somehow a translator got put in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.020 
here so somehow a translator got put in
place<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.170> translator<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.250> are

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
place and the translator is the are

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.930 
place and the translator is the are
enzymes<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.930> without<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.980> enzymes<00:02:56.430> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
enzymes and without the enzymes it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.850 
enzymes and without the enzymes it
wouldn't<00:02:57.480> work<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.870> because<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.709> two

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
wouldn't work at all because the two

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.890 
wouldn't work at all because the two
languages<00:02:59.340> can't<00:02:59.730> communicate<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.870> each

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
languages can't communicate with each

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.720 
languages can't communicate with each
other<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.650> two<00:03:01.829> sets<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.190> languages

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
other so we have two sets of languages

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.089 
other so we have two sets of languages
we<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.569> translator<00:03:04.170> mechanism<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
we have the translator mechanism and

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.839 
we have the translator mechanism and
that<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.930> DNA<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.739> able<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.220> work

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
that is how this DNA is able to work

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.710 
that is how this DNA is able to work
problem<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:09.989> DNA<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.519> from<00:03:12.390> when

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
problem with DNA is that from when

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.339 
problem with DNA is that from when

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:11.870 
years ago so Francis Crick concluded
that<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:08.389> either<00:04:09.389> was<00:04:10.139> done<00:04:10.739> by<00:04:11.099> at

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
that that this either was done by at

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.759 
that that this either was done by at
what<00:04:12.120> did<00:04:12.329> what<00:04:12.690> happened<00:04:13.019> by<00:04:13.109> chance<00:04:13.139> as

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
what did what happened by chance as

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.060 
what did what happened by chance as
we're<00:04:14.220> told<00:04:14.430> by<00:04:14.639> science<00:04:15.030> or<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:16.289> didn't<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.859> he

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
we're told by science or it didn't so he

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.490 
we're told by science or it didn't so he
ran<00:04:17.280> very<00:04:17.700> sophisticated<00:04:18.209> computer<00:04:19.139> models

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
ran very sophisticated computer models

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.089 
ran very sophisticated computer models
to<00:04:20.160> try<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> determine<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.180> odds<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:22.070> such<00:04:23.070> a

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
to try to determine the odds of such a

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.550 
to try to determine the odds of such a
complex<00:04:23.700> organism<00:04:25.550> becoming<00:04:26.550> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
complex organism becoming a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.960 
complex organism becoming a
putting<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.800> being<00:04:29.069> put<00:04:29.310> together<00:04:29.490> by

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
putting it being put together by

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.839 
putting it being put together by
accident<00:04:30.660> say<00:04:31.169> by<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> lightning<00:04:31.770> bolt<00:04:32.160> or<00:04:32.550> by

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
accident say by a lightning bolt or by

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.300 
accident say by a lightning bolt or by
just<00:04:33.210> chemical<00:04:33.810> reactions<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.530> he

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
just chemical reactions and he

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.700 
just chemical reactions and he
discovered<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.990> odds<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.620> that

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
discovered that the odds of that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.409 
discovered that the odds of that
happening<00:04:38.669> were<00:04:39.539> were<00:04:40.080> greater<00:04:40.500> than<00:04:41.419> the

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
happening were were greater than the

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.320 
happening were were greater than the
number<00:04:42.449> of<00:04:42.870> all<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.710> atoms<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.580> universe

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.600 

so<00:04:48.330> he<00:04:48.539> concluded<00:04:49.199> wisely<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:50.009> you<00:04:50.250> could<00:04:50.460> we

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
so he concluded wisely that you could we

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.870 
so he concluded wisely that you could we
could<00:04:50.819> rule<00:04:51.030> out<00:04:51.090> DNA<00:04:51.900> as<00:04:52.169> being<00:04:52.770> an

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
could rule out DNA as being an

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.309 
could rule out DNA as being an
accidental<00:04:53.880> thing<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:55.380> then<00:04:56.220> up<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.840> question

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
accidental thing so then up the question

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.920 
accidental thing so then up the question
is<00:04:58.500> okay<00:04:58.880> where<00:04:59.880> did<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.030> come<00:05:00.270> from<00:05:00.300> if<00:05:00.720> it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
is okay where did it come from if it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.890 
is okay where did it come from if it
didn't<00:05:01.199> evolve<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:02.940> if<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.569> didn't

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
didn't evolve here and if it didn't

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.050 
didn't evolve here and if it didn't
wasn't<00:05:04.500> created<00:05:04.830> by<00:05:04.919> accident<00:05:05.610> where<00:05:05.819> did<00:05:05.970> it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
wasn't created by accident where did it

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.830 
wasn't created by accident where did it
come<00:05:06.300> from<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:07.380> he<00:05:07.620> created<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.690> theory<00:05:09.690> of

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
come from and he created the theory of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.460 
come from and he created the theory of
dirt<00:05:10.560> directed<00:05:11.370> panspermia<00:05:11.750> which<00:05:12.750> merely

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
dirt directed panspermia which merely

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.600 
dirt directed panspermia which merely
says<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.659> DNA<00:05:15.659> was<00:05:16.020> sent<00:05:16.289> here<00:05:16.530> by<00:05:16.800> higher

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
says that DNA was sent here by higher

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.290 
says that DNA was sent here by higher
intelligence<00:05:18.830> long<00:05:19.830> long<00:05:20.130> time<00:05:20.370> ago<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.000> that

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
intelligence long long time ago and that

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.140 
intelligence long long time ago and that
life<00:05:21.630> on<00:05:21.930> Earth<00:05:22.139> was<00:05:22.440> seeded<00:05:22.979> up<00:05:24.319> from<00:05:25.319> other

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
life on Earth was seeded up from other

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.469 
life on Earth was seeded up from other

known<00:05:34.259> that<00:05:34.400> while<00:05:35.400> he<00:05:35.610> was<00:05:35.729> trying<00:05:36.000> to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
known that while he was trying to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.159 
known that while he was trying to
understand<00:05:36.659> the<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.909> form<00:05:38.909> form<00:05:39.389> of<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.930> DNA

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
understand the the form form of the DNA

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.610 
understand the the form form of the DNA
took<00:05:40.729> he<00:05:41.729> took<00:05:42.409> LSD<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:44.130> open<00:05:44.460> his<00:05:44.610> mind<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
took he took LSD to open his mind to the

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.260 
took he took LSD to open his mind to the
to<00:05:46.860> understand<00:05:47.340> such<00:05:47.669> things<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:49.110> he<00:05:49.860> was<00:05:50.039> also

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
to understand such things so he was also

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.490 
to understand such things so he was also
exploring<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.570> shamanic<00:05:52.050> ways<00:05:52.349> but<00:05:54.349> so<00:05:55.349> we

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
exploring in shamanic ways but so we

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.600 
exploring in shamanic ways but so we
have<00:05:55.800> now<00:05:56.180> NASA<00:05:57.180> who<00:05:57.690> has<00:05:57.900> twice<00:05:58.610> announced

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
have now NASA who has twice announced

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.520 
have now NASA who has twice announced
that<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:01.130> DNA<00:06:02.130> comes<00:06:02.759> from<00:06:03.090> outer<00:06:03.240> space<00:06:03.599> the

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
that a DNA comes from outer space the

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.830 
that a DNA comes from outer space the
first<00:06:04.770> time<00:06:05.039> was<00:06:05.400> with<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:05.909> Mars<00:06:06.150> meteorite

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
first time was with the Mars meteorite

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.600 
first time was with the Mars meteorite
where<00:06:07.469> they<00:06:07.620> found<00:06:08.449> nano<00:06:09.449> bacteria

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
where they found nano bacteria

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.189 
where they found nano bacteria
fossilized<00:06:11.610> nano<00:06:11.969> bacteria<00:06:12.659> that<00:06:12.810> was<00:06:12.990> pretty

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
fossilized nano bacteria that was pretty

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.990 
fossilized nano bacteria that was pretty
much<00:06:13.440> poo-pooed<00:06:14.250> by<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.520> scientific

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
much poo-pooed by the scientific

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.939 
much poo-pooed by the scientific
community<00:06:15.180> and<00:06:15.840> then<00:06:16.500> in<00:06:17.750> august<00:06:18.750> of<00:06:18.960> four

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
community and then in august of four

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.129 
community and then in august of four
they<00:06:20.789> found<00:06:21.300> another<00:06:21.449> meteor<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:23.099> they<00:06:23.729> said

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
they found another meteor that they said

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.990 
they found another meteor that they said
this<00:06:25.139> one<00:06:25.409> was<00:06:25.740> from<00:06:26.250> europe<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:26.729> other<00:06:26.849> one

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
this one was from europe the other one

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.240 
this one was from europe the other one
was<00:06:27.180> from<00:06:27.449> the<00:06:27.750> I<00:06:28.050> think<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.590> Antarctic<00:06:29.069> and

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
was from the I think the Antarctic and

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.420 
was from the I think the Antarctic and
they<00:06:29.969> found<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:31.050> same<00:06:31.259> thing<00:06:31.560> but<00:06:31.590> much<00:06:32.039> more

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
they found the same thing but much more

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.649 
they found the same thing but much more
convincing<00:06:33.680> fossilized<00:06:34.680> bacteria<00:06:35.039> and<00:06:35.760> made

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
convincing fossilized bacteria and made

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.170 
convincing fossilized bacteria and made
another<00:06:37.050> big<00:06:37.349> press<00:06:37.650> conference<00:06:37.680> saying<00:06:38.460> that

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
another big press conference saying that

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.570 
another big press conference saying that
they<00:06:39.539> found<00:06:39.810> fossilized<00:06:40.620> bacteria<00:06:40.949> on

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
they found fossilized bacteria on

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.360 
they found fossilized bacteria on
another<00:06:42.479> meteor<00:06:43.110> but<00:06:43.560> this<00:06:43.740> one<00:06:43.949> they<00:06:44.190> don't

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
another meteor but this one they don't

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.670 
another meteor but this one they don't
know<00:06:44.490> where<00:06:44.699> it<00:06:44.820> came<00:06:45.030> from<00:06:45.169> God<00:06:46.169> knows<00:06:46.410> it

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
know where it came from God knows it

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.529 
know where it came from God knows it
could<00:06:46.919> have<00:06:47.039> been<00:06:47.160> flying<00:06:47.699> through<00:06:48.000> space<00:06:48.030> for

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
could have been flying through space for

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.279 
could have been flying through space for
a<00:06:48.570> billion<00:06:48.840> years<00:06:49.130> so<00:06:50.130> we<00:06:50.370> do<00:06:50.550> know<00:06:50.729> that<00:06:51.289> DNA

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
a billion years so we do know that DNA

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.770 
a billion years so we do know that DNA
exists<00:06:52.860> in<00:06:53.190> the<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.759> bacteria<00:06:54.330> that<00:06:54.389> they

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
exists in the the bacteria that they

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.159 
exists in the the bacteria that they
found<00:06:55.220> is<00:06:56.220> exactly<00:06:56.789> like<00:06:56.910> the<00:06:57.479> bacteria<00:06:57.990> that

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
found is exactly like the bacteria that

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.270 
found is exactly like the bacteria that
you<00:06:58.289> find<00:06:58.590> here<00:06:58.830> on<00:06:58.979> earth<00:06:59.960> with<00:07:00.960> the

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
you find here on earth with the

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.080 
you find here on earth with the
exception<00:07:02.280> that<00:07:02.310> it<00:07:02.729> has<00:07:03.199> different<00:07:05.090> isotope

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
exception that it has different isotope

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.300 
exception that it has different isotope
accreting<00:07:06.690> 'he's<00:07:06.720> that<00:07:07.289> you<00:07:07.500> do<00:07:07.620> not<00:07:07.800> find<00:07:08.100> on

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
accreting 'he's that you do not find on

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.920 
accreting 'he's that you do not find on
earth<00:07:08.340> so<00:07:09.560> definitely<00:07:10.560> alien<00:07:11.009> DNA<00:07:11.780> NASA's<00:07:12.780> are

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
earth so definitely alien DNA NASA's are

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.050 
earth so definitely alien DNA NASA's are

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.409 
laureate told us this in his book life
itself<00:07:19.280> you<00:07:20.280> know<00:07:20.400> I<00:07:20.430> think<00:07:20.639> it's<00:07:20.940> about<00:07:21.120> time

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
itself you know I think it's about time

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:27.230 
itself you know I think it's about time
that<00:07:21.479> we<00:07:21.720> recognize<00:07:22.289> that<00:07:24.380> where<00:07:25.520> our<00:07:26.520> origins

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
that we recognize that where our origins

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.200 
that we recognize that where our origins
are<00:07:27.449> from<00:07:27.479> and<00:07:28.139> they're<00:07:28.500> not<00:07:28.650> from<00:07:28.949> here<00:07:29.250> we're

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
are from and they're not from here we're

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.640 
are from and they're not from here we're
all<00:07:30.449> from<00:07:30.930> out<00:07:31.199> there<00:07:31.530> someplace<00:07:31.949> and<00:07:32.460> if<00:07:33.120> DNA

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
all from out there someplace and if DNA

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.499 
all from out there someplace and if DNA
exists<00:07:34.650> elsewhere<00:07:35.000> then<00:07:36.470> there<00:07:37.470> is

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509 
exists elsewhere then there is

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.040 
exists elsewhere then there is
definitely<00:07:39.509> some<00:07:39.990> form<00:07:40.320> of<00:07:40.500> life<00:07:40.889> out<00:07:41.729> there

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
definitely some form of life out there

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.879 
definitely some form of life out there
waiting<00:07:43.050> for<00:07:43.260> us<00:07:43.500> to<00:07:43.560> be<00:07:44.210> for<00:07:45.210> us<00:07:45.270> to<00:07:45.479> discover

waiting for us to be for us to discover
except<00:07:46.889> that<00:07:47.039> I<00:07:47.070> think<00:07:47.400> they<00:07:47.550> discovered<00:07:48.030> us

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
except that I think they discovered us

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.230 
except that I think they discovered us
first<00:07:48.449> I'm<00:07:49.349> totally<00:07:50.070> out<00:07:50.370> of<00:07:50.400> time<00:07:50.760> I<00:07:51.030> could

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 
first I'm totally out of time I could

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.120 
first I'm totally out of time I could
