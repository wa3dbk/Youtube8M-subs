00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I have designed the colorful and daring look 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.950
 at the same time elegant wants to know how 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.450
 it does 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.700
 we prepare the skin with cream for the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.679
 eye contour and prebase we cover with 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 concealer dark circles and any other 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 imperfection we apply it by touching 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.350
 soft with your finger we give a thin layer 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.170
 of fluid base hd and we fix everything except 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 the mobile eyelid with translucent powders 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.779
 we create the structure of our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.000
 makeup with cream colors and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 pencils i used white blue clarito 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.329
 dark blue and green doing this the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 colors are more intense and last longer 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.890
 I should have applied some cream 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.149
 purple but I could not buy it 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 advice if you usually stain the skin when 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 apply shadow use a brush like 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 this to avoid it we started to apply 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 a dark blue shadow to mark the ub 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 and the gradients out mixing 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.059
 with light blue 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.059
 preferably using matte shadows 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.900
 in the lower body area 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850

 matt purple in the interior area of ​​the ub 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.810

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.460
 there are cuts we apply black eyeliner and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.550
