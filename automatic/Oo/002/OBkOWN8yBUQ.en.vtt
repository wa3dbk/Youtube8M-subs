working on damage system that checks on

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.820 
working on damage system that checks on
what<00:04:47.030> part<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.389> Mario's<00:04:47.780> body<00:04:48.080> he's<00:04:48.379> been<00:04:48.590> hit

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
what part of Mario's body he's been hit

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.040 
what part of Mario's body he's been hit
as<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.610> damage<00:04:49.819> to<00:04:50.120> each<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.419> Mario's<00:04:50.719> body

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
as the damage to each of Mario's body

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.589 
as the damage to each of Mario's body
parts<00:04:51.409> worsens<00:04:51.919> surges<00:04:52.610> his<00:04:52.759> ability<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.389> use

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
parts worsens surges his ability to use

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.839 
parts worsens surges his ability to use
that<00:04:53.810> part<00:04:54.080> if<00:04:54.710> he<00:04:54.800> gets<00:04:54.979> hit<00:04:55.159> too<00:04:55.310> many<00:04:55.340> times

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
that part if he gets hit too many times

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.749 
that part if he gets hit too many times
he'll<00:04:56.210> become<00:04:56.389> disabled<00:04:57.219> I'd<00:04:58.219> also<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.699> to

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
he'll become disabled I'd also like to

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.209 
he'll become disabled I'd also like to
start<00:04:59.150> seeing<00:04:59.419> Mario<00:04:59.840> used<00:05:00.110> knives<00:05:00.409> they

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
start seeing Mario used knives they

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.649 
start seeing Mario used knives they
don't<00:05:01.400> need<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.639> be<00:05:01.759> a<00:05:01.789> big<00:05:02.000> part<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.479> game

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
don't need to be a big part of the game

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.059 
don't need to be a big part of the game
I<00:05:02.900> just<00:05:02.930> think<00:05:03.259> it<00:05:03.379> would<00:05:03.469> be<00:05:03.530> useful<00:05:03.860> for

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
I just think it would be useful for

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.300 
I just think it would be useful for
Mario's<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.699> have<00:05:04.819> a<00:05:04.849> knife<00:05:05.090> sometimes

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
Mario's to have a knife sometimes

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.830 
Mario's to have a knife sometimes
finally<00:05:07.310> I'd<00:05:07.879> like<00:05:07.909> to<00:05:08.090> see<00:05:08.330> what<00:05:08.509> happens

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
finally I'd like to see what happens

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.260 
finally I'd like to see what happens
when<00:05:08.960> Mario<00:05:09.379> and<00:05:09.590> Shrek<00:05:09.860> team<00:05:10.159> up<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.639> don't

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
when Mario and Shrek team up I don't

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.550 
when Mario and Shrek team up I don't
think<00:05:11.479> we'll<00:05:11.599> be<00:05:11.629> seeing<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.080> game<00:05:12.289> for<00:05:12.530> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
think we'll be seeing this game for a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.800 
think we'll be seeing this game for a
while<00:05:12.620> it's<00:05:13.129> just<00:05:13.310> an<00:05:13.400> idea<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.909> the<00:05:14.030> works<00:05:14.210> but

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
while it's just an idea in the works but

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.180 
while it's just an idea in the works but
I<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.259> could<00:05:15.409> be<00:05:15.440> very<00:05:15.650> good<00:05:15.919> if<00:05:16.039> it's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
I think it could be very good if it's

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.939 
I think it could be very good if it's
done<00:05:16.400> running<00:05:16.840> wow<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.409> sounds<00:05:18.620> like<00:05:18.740> you've

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
done running wow it sounds like you've

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.740 
done running wow it sounds like you've
got<00:05:18.979> some<00:05:19.190> great<00:05:19.550> Mario<00:05:20.030> innovations<00:05:20.599> you're

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
got some great Mario innovations you're

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.379 
got some great Mario innovations you're
