00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
had some problems with this at the very

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.609 
had some problems with this at the very
beginning<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> could<00:00:16.230> very

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
beginning and I don't know I could very

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.859 
beginning and I don't know I could very
easily<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:17.250> other<00:00:17.789> people<00:00:18.270> having<00:00:18.750> some

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
easily see other people having some

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.170 
easily see other people having some
issues<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.039> basically<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:20.970> want

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
issues with it so basically I just want

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
issues with it so basically I just want
to<00:00:21.240> throw<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> quick<00:00:21.810> video<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.470> I've

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
to throw up a quick video for you I've

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.460 
to throw up a quick video for you I've
only<00:00:22.859> got<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> novice<00:00:23.730> down<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.439> imagine<00:00:25.439> that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
only got the novice down I imagine that

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.410 
only got the novice down I imagine that
once<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> harder<00:00:26.640> levels<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
once we get to the harder levels that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.779 
once we get to the harder levels that
there's<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> it'll<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.490> more

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
there's going to be it'll be more

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.310 
there's going to be it'll be more
sensitive<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.449> I'll<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.720> ahead<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.080> show<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
sensitive and I'll go ahead and show you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
sensitive and I'll go ahead and show you
real<00:00:31.619> quick<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:31.980> we're<00:00:32.099> using<00:00:32.340> both<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.940> left

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
real quick so we're using both the left

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.600 
real quick so we're using both the left
analog<00:00:33.960> stick<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> right<00:00:35.160> hand<00:00:35.399> long

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
analog stick in the right hand long

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
analog stick in the right hand long
stick<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.510> left<00:00:36.750> analog<00:00:37.230> stick<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.860> basically

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
stick the left analog stick is basically

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.959 
stick the left analog stick is basically
us<00:00:39.239> jumbling<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.440> pins<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.760> does

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
us jumbling the pins it really does

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.900 
us jumbling the pins it really does
nothing<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.719> now<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.399> kind<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
nothing for now now you kind of just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.000 
nothing for now now you kind of just
have<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.149> ballpark<00:00:45.960> where<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
have the ballpark where you want this to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
have the ballpark where you want this to
be<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:48.930> analog

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
be and then you use your right analog

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.090 
be and then you use your right analog
stick<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.309> slowly<00:00:50.850> turn<00:00:51.510> okay<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:52.920> gonna

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
stick to slowly turn okay so I'm gonna

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
stick to slowly turn okay so I'm gonna
stick<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.370> okay<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.930> right

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
stick this okay so you see how right

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
stick this okay so you see how right
here<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.280> shakes<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> oh<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.840> broke<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.350> lock

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here it shakes and oh I broke my lock

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
here it shakes and oh I broke my lock
pick<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> gotta

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
pick so what you want to do is you gotta

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
pick so what you want to do is you gotta
find<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.809> sweet<00:01:01.170> spot<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.710> slowly<00:01:02.250> turn

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
find that sweet spot and slowly turn

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.440 
find that sweet spot and slowly turn
with<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.470> analog<00:01:04.920> stick<00:01:05.100> until<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
with your right analog stick until you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
with your right analog stick until you
can<00:01:06.659> find<00:01:07.970> where<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> lock<00:01:11.400> pick

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
can find where your the lock pick

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
can find where your the lock pick
doesn't<00:01:12.150> break<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:12.810> essentially

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
doesn't break because you're essentially

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
doesn't break because you're essentially
using<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> lock<00:01:14.040> pick<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> knife<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
using a lock pick and then a knife to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
using a lock pick and then a knife to
spin<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> left<00:01:18.210> analog

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
spin it so just use the left analog

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.410 
spin it so just use the left analog
stick<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> lock<00:01:20.130> pick<00:01:20.460> into<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.909> spot

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
stick to get that lock pick into a spot

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.859 
stick to get that lock pick into a spot
where<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> doesn't<00:01:22.259> break<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.970> where

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
where it doesn't break and then where

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
where it doesn't break and then where
it's<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.350> shaking<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it's not shaking and then you use the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's not shaking and then you use the
right<00:01:27.600> analog<00:01:27.960> stick<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.890> spin<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.540> lock<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
right analog stick to spin the lock so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
right analog stick to spin the lock so
that<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.729> unlocks<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.259> ahead

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that way it unlocks so let's go ahead

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
that way it unlocks so let's go ahead
and<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.340> seems<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.939> pretty<00:01:36.150> good

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and see this way seems to be pretty good

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.450 
and see this way seems to be pretty good
I<00:01:36.540> haven't<00:01:36.930> hit<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.409> broken<00:01:37.710> spots<00:01:38.280> yet
