know you guys got to see a lot in the
time-lapse<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.920> thought<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.150> might<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.630> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
time-lapse but thought you might want to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.630 
time-lapse but thought you might want to
see<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.950> whole<00:02:38.100> thing<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:40.680> anyway

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
see the whole thing like this but anyway

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.390 
see the whole thing like this but anyway
this<00:02:42.360> set<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.200> pretty<00:02:43.380> cool<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this set is actually pretty cool it is a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.840 
this set is actually pretty cool it is a
little<00:02:44.790> bit<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> expensive<00:02:45.450> side<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
little bit on the expensive side and I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.530 
little bit on the expensive side and I
think<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.690> boat<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:50.030> one<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.180> favorite

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
think the boat is one of my favorite

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660 
think the boat is one of my favorite
friend<00:02:51.780> sets<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.230> far<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.310> mostly

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
friend sets so far and it's mostly

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.880 
friend sets so far and it's mostly
because<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.120> doesn't<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.020> much<00:02:55.260> pink<00:02:55.680> as

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
because it doesn't have as much pink as

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.510 
because it doesn't have as much pink as
the<00:02:56.040> others<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.520> like<00:02:57.060> using<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.630> light<00:02:57.810> blue

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
the others I like using the light blue

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.580 
the others I like using the light blue
instead<00:02:59.520> because<00:02:59.940> girls<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.960> guys<00:03:01.140> both

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
instead because girls and guys both

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.610 
instead because girls and guys both
would<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:01.950> that

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
would like that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.380 
would like that
basically<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.700> boat<00:03:05.940> would<00:03:06.240> be

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
basically I think this boat would be

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.100 
basically I think this boat would be
phenomenal

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
phenomenal

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.980 
phenomenal
to<00:03:07.590> use<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.430> other<00:03:08.580> themes<00:03:08.970> even<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.840> is

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
to use for other themes even like it is

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.050 
to use for other themes even like it is
if<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.710> didn't<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.030> know

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
if they just didn't have this you know

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.710 
if they just didn't have this you know
girlie<00:03:12.540> heart<00:03:12.810> sticker<00:03:14.240> not<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.450> think

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
girlie heart sticker not that I think

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.830 
girlie heart sticker not that I think
it's<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> bad<00:03:16.140> thing<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.460> that<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:18.060> think

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
it's a bad thing it's just that I think

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.770 
it's a bad thing it's just that I think
it<00:03:19.140> could<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.410> been<00:03:19.530> used<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:21.420> know<00:03:21.450> for

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
it could have been used you know for

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.410 
it could have been used you know for
mocks<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.680> things<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.030> I'm<00:03:24.180> sure<00:03:24.390> people

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
mocks and things and I'm sure people

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.780 
mocks and things and I'm sure people
will<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.710> take<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.100> off<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.280> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
will you know just take that off and and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
will you know just take that off and and
make<00:03:27.060> their<00:03:27.240> own<00:03:27.270> boats<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.080> but

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
make their own boats out of this but

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.560 
make their own boats out of this but
anyway<00:03:28.980> let's<00:03:29.760> take<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.970> look<00:03:30.180> at<00:03:30.300> it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
anyway let's take a look at it

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.170 
anyway let's take a look at it
the<00:03:31.020> first<00:03:31.230> thing<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.610> whole<00:03:32.880> part

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the first thing is that this whole part

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.770 
the first thing is that this whole part
lifts<00:03:33.540> off<00:03:34.130> very<00:03:35.130> easily<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.240> I'm<00:03:36.600> going<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
lifts off very easily so I'm going to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.350 
lifts off very easily so I'm going to
actually<00:03:37.170> suit<00:03:37.710> that<00:03:37.890> part<00:03:38.220> back<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.240> can

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
actually suit that part back so we can

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.840 
actually suit that part back so we can
look<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.780> part<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:41.250> do<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.580> glass

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
look at this part you do have the glass

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.610 
look at this part you do have the glass
here<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.650> open<00:03:43.950> up<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.990> there's<00:03:46.380> that

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
here you can open up and there's that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.880 
here you can open up and there's that
sticker<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.520> talking<00:03:47.820> about<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.440> here's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
sticker I was talking about and here's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.040 
sticker I was talking about and here's
the<00:03:50.100> top<00:03:50.880> you've<00:03:51.150> got<00:03:51.180> where<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> captain

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
the top you've got where the captain

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.310 
the top you've got where the captain
sits<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.550> see<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.970> dolphin<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
sits and you can see the dolphin on the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.280 
sits and you can see the dolphin on the
radar<00:03:55.740> there<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.910> got<00:04:00.120> some<00:04:00.660> drinks<00:04:01.050> back

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
radar there and you got some drinks back

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.260 
radar there and you got some drinks back
there<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:01.830> him<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:03.120> looks<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.480> speakers

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
there for him this looks like speakers

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.680 
there for him this looks like speakers
and<00:04:06.440> that's<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.650> top<00:04:08.250> that's<00:04:09.000> that'll<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and that's the top that's that'll be the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.699 
and that's the top that's that'll be the
very<00:04:09.870> top<00:04:10.050> of<00:04:10.080> your<00:04:10.230> boat<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.959> there's<00:04:13.590> now

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
very top of your boat and so there's now

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.789 
very top of your boat and so there's now

which is very cool I love the slide at
the<00:06:29.080> back<00:06:29.289> and<00:06:30.250> you<00:06:30.970> do<00:06:31.090> have<00:06:31.409> little<00:06:32.409> stairs

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
the back and you do have little stairs

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.100 
the back and you do have little stairs
you<00:06:33.880> know<00:06:33.969> where<00:06:34.180> they<00:06:34.330> can<00:06:34.510> climb<00:06:34.750> up<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:34.960> the

you know where they can climb up to the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.040 
you know where they can climb up to the
slide<00:06:35.469> and<00:06:35.860> slide<00:06:36.580> down<00:06:36.639> into<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.270> water

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
slide and slide down into the water

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.140 
slide and slide down into the water
you<00:06:40.050> know<00:06:40.139> I'll<00:06:40.380> bucket<00:06:41.250> with<00:06:41.460> fish<00:06:41.639> in<00:06:41.669> it<00:06:41.880> for

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
you know I'll bucket with fish in it for

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.520 
you know I'll bucket with fish in it for
some<00:06:42.270> strange<00:06:42.600> reason<00:06:42.660> I<00:06:43.050> guess<00:06:43.320> they<00:06:43.470> were

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
some strange reason I guess they were

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.790 
some strange reason I guess they were
fishing<00:06:44.030> and<00:06:45.030> this<00:06:45.240> looks<00:06:45.660> like<00:06:46.020> I<00:06:46.380> believe

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
fishing and this looks like I believe

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.170 
fishing and this looks like I believe
it's<00:06:46.949> supposed<00:06:47.250> to<00:06:47.280> be<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.460> shower<00:06:47.760> right<00:06:48.120> here

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
it's supposed to be a shower right here

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.129 
it's supposed to be a shower right here
got<00:06:49.050> the<00:06:49.290> blue<00:06:49.979> and<00:06:50.430> red<00:06:50.910> for<00:06:51.510> you<00:06:51.810> know<00:06:51.900> hot

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
got the blue and red for you know hot

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.020 
got the blue and red for you know hot
and<00:06:52.290> cold<00:06:52.530> so<00:06:53.190> I<00:06:53.250> think<00:06:53.310> that's<00:06:53.610> meant<00:06:53.850> to<00:06:53.940> be<00:06:54.000> a

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
and cold so I think that's meant to be a

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.379 
and cold so I think that's meant to be a
shower<00:06:54.300> so<00:06:54.960> that's<00:06:55.110> kind<00:06:55.320> of<00:06:55.350> cool

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
shower so that's kind of cool

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.350 
shower so that's kind of cool
real<00:06:57.389> life<00:06:57.690> preserver<00:06:58.110> on<00:06:58.320> the<00:06:58.440> side<00:06:58.650> there<00:06:58.919> so

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
real life preserver on the side there so

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.840 
real life preserver on the side there so
I<00:07:00.360> think<00:07:00.630> this<00:07:00.930> boat<00:07:01.139> is<00:07:01.350> pretty<00:07:01.680> cool<00:07:01.979> it<00:07:02.669> does

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
I think this boat is pretty cool it does

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.100 
I think this boat is pretty cool it does
have<00:07:03.060> a<00:07:03.360> lot<00:07:03.720> to<00:07:04.020> it<00:07:04.199> and<00:07:05.389> like<00:07:06.389> I<00:07:06.479> said<00:07:06.540> you

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
have a lot to it and like I said you

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.260 
have a lot to it and like I said you
could<00:07:07.470> really<00:07:07.889> use<00:07:08.220> this<00:07:08.460> for<00:07:08.729> other<00:07:08.880> themes

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
could really use this for other themes

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.050 
could really use this for other themes
if<00:07:09.540> you<00:07:09.660> wanted<00:07:10.020> I<00:07:10.490> think<00:07:11.490> you<00:07:11.729> could<00:07:11.880> very

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
if you wanted I think you could very

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.620 
if you wanted I think you could very
easily<00:07:12.150> modify<00:07:13.050> it<00:07:13.110> or<00:07:13.760> even<00:07:14.760> use<00:07:14.910> it<00:07:15.060> as<00:07:15.180> is<00:07:15.389> I

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
easily modify it or even use it as is I

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.840 
easily modify it or even use it as is I
think<00:07:15.720> it'd<00:07:15.900> be<00:07:16.020> pretty<00:07:16.139> cool<00:07:16.380> so<00:07:17.220> anyway<00:07:17.490> I

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
think it'd be pretty cool so anyway I

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.719 
think it'd be pretty cool so anyway I
