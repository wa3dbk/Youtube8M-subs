a really good job with their detail on
these<00:01:33.500> models<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.910> they're<00:01:35.240> relatively<00:01:35.780> not

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
these models and they're relatively not

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.050 
these models and they're relatively not
that<00:01:36.230> expensive<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:36.950> model<00:01:37.340> runs<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.880> think

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
that expensive this model runs I think

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.640 
that expensive this model runs I think
the<00:01:38.150> latest<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.540> looked<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.930> can<00:01:39.110> pick<00:01:39.350> one<00:01:39.500> up

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
the latest I looked you can pick one up

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.280 
the latest I looked you can pick one up
for<00:01:39.770> around<00:01:39.920> $69<00:01:40.910> or<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.270> there's<00:01:42.050> probably

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
for around $69 or so there's probably

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.960 
for around $69 or so there's probably
even<00:01:42.650> better<00:01:42.920> deals<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.580> out<00:01:43.760> there<00:01:43.940> I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
even better deals and that out there I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.490 
even better deals and that out there I
just<00:01:44.120> did<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.270> real<00:01:44.450> quick<00:01:44.690> search<00:01:45.020> before<00:01:45.290> I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
just did a real quick search before I

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.370 
just did a real quick search before I
started<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.370> video<00:01:47.080> all<00:01:48.080> right<00:01:48.140> we're<00:01:48.350> just

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
started this video all right we're just

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.930 
started this video all right we're just
gonna<00:01:48.530> start<00:01:48.800> at<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.890> tail<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.190> come<00:01:49.700> back

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
gonna start at the tail and come back

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.760 
gonna start at the tail and come back
and<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.510> just<00:01:50.540> gonna<00:01:50.810> keep<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.110> camera<00:01:51.350> out

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
and I'm just gonna keep this camera out

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.320 
and I'm just gonna keep this camera out
a<00:01:51.890> little<00:01:52.190> bit<00:01:52.400> so<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.670> can<00:01:52.700> kind<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.060> get<00:01:53.210> the

a little bit so you can kind of get the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:06.210 
a little bit so you can kind of get the
whole<00:01:53.510> overall<00:01:53.930> profile

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.920 

come<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.850> little<00:02:06.970> further<00:02:07.120> out<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.540> zoom<00:02:07.720> I'm

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
come a little further out of zoom I'm

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.770 
come a little further out of zoom I'm
gonna<00:02:08.080> give<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.320> just<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.710> real<00:02:08.890> quick<00:02:09.160> 360

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you all this with the closed cockpit

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.179 
you all this with the closed cockpit
configured<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.319> real<00:03:51.530> quick<00:03:51.739> before<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.069> get

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
configured I real quick before I get

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.039 
configured I real quick before I get
into<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.849> closed<00:03:53.030> cockpit<00:03:53.299> cockpit

into the closed cockpit cockpit
configuration<00:03:54.739> here<00:03:54.920> would<00:03:55.099> be<00:03:55.250> basically

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
configuration here would be basically

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.640 
configuration here would be basically
his<00:03:56.900> camera<00:03:57.319> get<00:03:57.470> him<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.709> view<00:03:59.230> the<00:04:00.230> gear<00:04:00.439> door

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
his camera get him in view the gear door

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.319 
his camera get him in view the gear door

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
replacement so you can pull the gear off

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.000 
replacement so you can pull the gear off
and<00:04:02.690> these<00:04:02.750> go<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.200> they're<00:04:03.290> put<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.829> their

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
and these go and they're put in their

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.069 
and these go and they're put in their
place<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.180> display<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.690> like<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.019> said

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
place and you can display it like I said

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:14.319 
place and you can display it like I said
is<00:04:06.379> if<00:04:06.590> in-flight<00:04:07.099> a<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:14.150> bit<00:04:14.269> of

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
is if in-flight a little bit of

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.539 
is if in-flight a little bit of
reflection<00:04:14.420> go<00:04:14.959> in<00:04:15.140> there<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:19.010> again<00:04:19.100> just

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
reflection go in there but again just

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:40.010 
reflection go in there but again just
check<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:19.940> out

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.870 

all<00:04:40.650> right<00:04:40.740> hang<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.040> second<00:04:41.340> I'm<00:04:41.430> gonna<00:04:41.520> try

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
all right hang on a second I'm gonna try

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.160 
all right hang on a second I'm gonna try
to<00:04:41.940> try<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.300> get<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.540> camera<00:04:42.750> up<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.020> little

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
to try to get this camera up a little

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.660 
to try to get this camera up a little
bit<00:04:43.290> higher<00:04:43.470> let<00:04:43.770> y'all<00:04:43.950> check<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.310> out<00:04:44.430> from<00:04:44.610> a

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
bit higher let y'all check it out from a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.860 
bit higher let y'all check it out from a
different<00:04:44.820> angle<00:04:45.030> all<00:04:45.240> right<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.540> hear

different angle all right so you hear

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.450 
different angle all right so you hear
you<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.140> see<00:04:46.290> a<00:04:46.320> little<00:04:46.500> different<00:04:46.950> camera

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
you can see a little different camera

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:56.060 
you can see a little different camera
