out<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> blade<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:10.020> helps

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
out of the blade so that really helps

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
out of the blade so that really helps
with<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> three<00:02:11.849> ounces<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
with that and three ounces is in the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.880 
with that and three ounces is in the
a<00:02:12.660> lot<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.380> I'm<00:02:13.800> definitely<00:02:14.100> happy<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
a lot so I'm definitely happy with that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910 
a lot so I'm definitely happy with that
let's<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> cons<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:19.020> know<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.590> kind

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
let's get to the cons you know it's kind

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
let's get to the cons you know it's kind
of<00:02:19.980> small<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.840> me<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> open<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.530> one-handed

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
of small for me to open this one-handed

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.760 
of small for me to open this one-handed
and<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.850> kind<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:25.440> kind

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
and you can kind of see here it's kind

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.630 
and you can kind of see here it's kind
of<00:02:25.830> tough<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.850> am<00:02:27.480> able<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.320> though<00:02:28.640> out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
of tough I am able to do that though out

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.120 
of tough I am able to do that though out
of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> box<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.660> was<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:31.650> tight

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
of the box it was really really tight

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.850 
of the box it was really really tight
and<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:33.270> got<00:02:33.480> online<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.200> started<00:02:34.620> reading

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and I got online and I started reading

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.350 
and I got online and I started reading
what<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.460> people<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.910> doing<00:02:36.060> with

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
what a lot of people are doing with

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.200 
what a lot of people are doing with
these<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.990> guess<00:02:37.490> Gerber<00:02:38.490> uses<00:02:38.970> some

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
these and I guess Gerber uses some

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
these and I guess Gerber uses some
Loctite<00:02:39.630> or<00:02:40.050> something<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.620> potentially

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
Loctite or something in here potentially

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.540 
Loctite or something in here potentially
I'm<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.910> 100%<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.010> read<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
I'm not 100% on that but I read that a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.210 
I'm not 100% on that but I read that a
lot<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.910> people<00:02:45.210> were<00:02:45.300> trying<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:46.040> undo<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
lot of people were trying to undo this

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770 
lot of people were trying to undo this
and<00:02:47.490> loosen<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.060> little<00:02:48.090> bit<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.600> we're

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and loosen it a little bit and we're

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.080 
and loosen it a little bit and we're
stripping<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> save<00:02:50.550> myself<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
stripping it so to save myself the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.240 
stripping it so to save myself the
trouble<00:02:51.210> all<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.230> did<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:52.830> put<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> little

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
trouble all I did was put a little

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.670 
trouble all I did was put a little
ballast<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.180> there<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.750> I've<00:02:55.470> been

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
ballast all in there and I've been

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.310 
ballast all in there and I've been
working<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.210> have<00:02:57.360> some<00:02:57.570> free<00:02:57.810> time<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
working it if I have some free time and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.010 
working it if I have some free time and
it's<00:02:58.800> definitely<00:02:58.980> loosened<00:02:59.760> up<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.690> open

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
it's definitely loosened up I can open

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.550 
it's definitely loosened up I can open
it<00:03:01.110> one-handed<00:03:01.560> pretty<00:03:02.070> quickly<00:03:02.340> now<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.260> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it one-handed pretty quickly now so it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500 
it one-handed pretty quickly now so it
is<00:03:04.590> getting<00:03:04.950> better<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.610> am<00:03:05.760> working<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.300> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
is getting better and I am working on it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.990 
is getting better and I am working on it
I<00:03:07.020> think<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:08.070> gonna<00:03:08.280> take<00:03:08.550> some<00:03:08.730> time

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I think that's just gonna take some time

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.630 
I think that's just gonna take some time
but<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.690> know<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> price<00:03:10.500> that's<00:03:11.310> still

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
but you know for the price that's still

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.310 
but you know for the price that's still
not<00:03:11.790> terrible

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
not terrible

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.950 
not terrible
another<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.700> gripe<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.270> have<00:03:15.300> about<00:03:15.720> this

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
another little gripe I have about this

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.100 
another little gripe I have about this
is<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.320> fit<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.710> finish<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.810> let<00:03:18.810> me<00:03:18.900> try<00:03:19.050> to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
is the fit and finish and let me try to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.480 
is the fit and finish and let me try to
get<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.440> close<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> camera<00:03:20.070> where<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.370> can

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
get it close to the camera where you can

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.080 
get it close to the camera where you can
see<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:21.560> now<00:03:22.560> granted<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.640> cheap<00:03:23.850> knife

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
see it now granted it's a cheap knife

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.620 
see it now granted it's a cheap knife
but<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.080> look<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.470> there

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
but if you look in there

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.270 
but if you look in there
they<00:03:27.630> could<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:27.990> sanded<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.560> out<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.130> see

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
they could have sanded that out you see

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.880 
they could have sanded that out you see
that<00:03:29.490> hump<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.940> steel<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.630> there<00:03:30.840> they<00:03:31.680> could

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
that hump of steel in there they could

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.380 
that hump of steel in there they could
have<00:03:32.010> done<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> better<00:03:32.280> job<00:03:32.520> with<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
have done a better job with that and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.110 
have done a better job with that and
look<00:03:33.870> at<00:03:33.960> this<00:03:34.170> right<00:03:34.470> here

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
look at this right here

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.850 
look at this right here
can<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.210> guys<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.690> mark<00:03:37.170> right<00:03:37.410> next<00:03:37.620> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
can you guys see that mark right next to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.910 
can you guys see that mark right next to
my<00:03:37.980> thump<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.990> mean<00:03:39.990> that's<00:03:40.230> probably<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.770> a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
my thump I mean that's probably just a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.880 
my thump I mean that's probably just a
casting<00:03:41.459> issue<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.780> factory<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.590> still

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
casting issue in the factory but still

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.000 
casting issue in the factory but still
it's<00:03:44.459> still<00:03:44.730> there<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:46.320> didn't<00:03:46.650> take<00:03:46.770> much<00:03:46.950> for

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it's still there it didn't take much for

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.940 
it's still there it didn't take much for
me<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.370> find<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.630> figured<00:03:49.530> I'd<00:03:49.680> share

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
me to find that so figured I'd share

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.510 
me to find that so figured I'd share
that<00:03:51.860> other<00:03:52.860> than<00:03:53.010> that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
that other than that

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.610 
that other than that
I<00:03:53.630> really<00:03:54.630> don't<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:54.870> too<00:03:55.080> much<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.440> say

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
I really don't have too much to say

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.000 
I really don't have too much to say
about<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:55.920> I'm<00:03:56.790> probably<00:03:57.060> gonna<00:03:57.360> carry<00:03:57.690> this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
about it I'm probably gonna carry this

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.590 
about it I'm probably gonna carry this
probably<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.220> my<00:03:59.520> backpack<00:03:59.730> or<00:04:00.150> something<00:04:00.300> for

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
probably in my backpack or something for

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.620 
probably in my backpack or something for
work<00:04:01.100> it<00:04:02.100> definitely<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> good<00:04:03.270> backup

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630
