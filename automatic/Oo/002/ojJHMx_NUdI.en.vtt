not<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> number<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.159> couple<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
not the number one the couple of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
not the number one the couple of
differences<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> pockets<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
differences is that the pockets on the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.880 
differences is that the pockets on the
outside<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:50.939> considerably<00:01:51.659> smaller<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
outside are considerably smaller on the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.870 
outside are considerably smaller on the
totally<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
totally and on the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.260 
totally and on the
he<00:01:55.000> emphasized<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:57.070> that's<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.939> would<00:01:58.000> say

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
he emphasized which that's I would say

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.240 
he emphasized which that's I would say
that's<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.659> only<00:01:58.689> drawback<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.619> that<00:02:00.009> side

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
that's the only drawback of that side

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550 
that's the only drawback of that side
this<00:02:00.670> size<00:02:00.909> is<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.259> little<00:02:02.439> bit

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
this size is that it's a little bit

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.069 
this size is that it's a little bit
harder<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.579> things<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.329> out<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
harder to get things in and out of the

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.419 
harder to get things in and out of the
pockets<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.180> mm<00:02:07.689> size<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.679> can<00:02:08.890> fit<00:02:09.160> like

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
pockets on the mm size you can fit like

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.850 
pockets on the mm size you can fit like
a<00:02:09.459> baby<00:02:09.970> bottle<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.810> can<00:02:10.989> fit<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> water<00:02:11.500> bottle

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
a baby bottle you can fit a water bottle

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.650 
a baby bottle you can fit a water bottle
it's<00:02:12.220> easier<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:12.849> drop<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.300> your<00:02:13.390> phone

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it's easier to just drop in your phone

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.870 
it's easier to just drop in your phone
and<00:02:14.019> your<00:02:14.200> keys<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.069> all<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.400> stuff<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:15.790> on

and your keys and all that stuff but on

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.570 
and your keys and all that stuff but on
this<00:02:16.090> size<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:17.260> still<00:02:17.500> fit<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.950> lot<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
this size you can still fit a lot but it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.540 
this size you can still fit a lot but it
takes<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:19.090> little<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:20.220> struggling<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.430> get

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
takes a little bit a struggling to get

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.759 
takes a little bit a struggling to get
it<00:02:21.700> out<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.720> thing<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.050> think<00:02:23.080> once

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
it out so that's one thing I think once

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.490 
it out so that's one thing I think once
the<00:02:24.010> canvas<00:02:24.550> softens<00:02:25.150> maybe<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the canvas softens maybe it will be a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.979 
the canvas softens maybe it will be a
little<00:02:26.830> bit<00:02:26.950> easier<00:02:27.130> but<00:02:27.910> still<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.299> really<00:02:28.780> do

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
little bit easier but still I really do

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.080 
little bit easier but still I really do
appreciate<00:02:29.380> having<00:02:29.920> those<00:02:30.190> outside<00:02:30.670> pockets

think<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.299> lot<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.569> people<00:03:46.930> shy<00:03:47.170> away<00:03:47.200> from

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
think that a lot of people shy away from

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.379 
think that a lot of people shy away from
this<00:03:47.889> size<00:03:48.130> because<00:03:48.459> they<00:03:48.760> think<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.180> it's

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
this size because they think that it's

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.509 
this size because they think that it's
too<00:03:49.750> small<00:03:50.109> or<00:03:50.620> they're<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:51.069> going<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.370> be

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
too small or they're not going to be

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.860 
too small or they're not going to be
able<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.700> fit<00:03:51.940> anything<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:52.540> like<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.810> said

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
able to fit anything but like I said

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.160 
able to fit anything but like I said
don't<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.829> fooled<00:03:54.069> by<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.280> size<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
don't be fooled by the size the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.490 
don't be fooled by the size the
pockets<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:57.120> inside<00:03:57.480> pockets<00:03:57.959> plus<00:03:58.290> all

this<00:03:58.650> extra<00:03:59.040> room<00:03:59.190> really<00:03:59.610> make<00:03:59.849> it

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
this extra room really make it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.360 
this extra room really make it
convenient<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.349> want<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.770> get<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.069> this

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
convenient do you want to get to this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.820 
convenient do you want to get to this
back<00:04:02.610> in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.300> ZURB<00:04:03.900> print<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.590> you're

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
back in the ZURB print and you're

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.100 
back in the ZURB print and you're
worried<00:04:05.190> about<00:04:05.340> color<00:04:05.760> transfer<00:04:06.390> again<00:04:07.080> I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
worried about color transfer again I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.559 
worried about color transfer again I
would<00:04:07.530> say<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.040> PM<00:04:08.400> size<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.060> good<00:04:09.300> size

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
would say that the PM size the good size

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.100 
would say that the PM size the good size
to<00:04:09.959> start<00:04:10.319> because<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.459> will<00:04:11.970> hit<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.780> just

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
to start because it will hit you just

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.559 
to start because it will hit you just
like<00:04:14.040> below<00:04:14.340> your<00:04:14.550> waist<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.450> you're

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
like below your waist and if you're

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.659 
like below your waist and if you're
wearing<00:04:15.780> like<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.530> few<00:04:16.680> wear<00:04:16.829> jeans<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.310> lot<00:04:17.459> like

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
wearing like a few wear jeans a lot like

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.479 
wearing like a few wear jeans a lot like
I<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.780> your<00:04:19.049> top<00:04:19.380> should<00:04:19.889> cover<00:04:20.220> at<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
I do but your top should cover at the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.550 
I do but your top should cover at the
Jean<00:04:20.760> part<00:04:21.150> where<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.510> hits<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.079> hope<00:04:22.380> that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
Jean part where it hits so I hope that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.770 
Jean part where it hits so I hope that
makes<00:04:22.770> sense<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.580> feel<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:24.389> I'm<00:04:24.600> not

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
makes sense so I feel like I'm not

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.170 
makes sense so I feel like I'm not
having<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.380> any<00:04:25.620> code<00:04:26.250> transfer<00:04:26.700> issues<00:04:26.970> on

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
having like any code transfer issues on

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.480 
having like any code transfer issues on
this<00:04:27.389> one<00:04:27.690> whereas<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.229> did<00:04:28.440> on<00:04:28.650> my<00:04:28.680> never<00:04:29.190> full

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
this one whereas I did on my never full

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.090 
this one whereas I did on my never full
mm<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.780> reason<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.260> because<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.830> hits

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
mm and the reason is because it hits

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.360 
mm and the reason is because it hits
just<00:04:32.580> right<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.210> below<00:04:33.990> my<00:04:34.260> waist<00:04:34.500> where<00:04:35.220> my

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
just right just below my waist where my

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.510 
just right just below my waist where my
shirt<00:04:35.639> is<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.450> never<00:04:36.690> hits<00:04:37.050> my<00:04:37.320> jeans<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.310> if

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
shirt is so it never hits my jeans so if

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.890 
shirt is so it never hits my jeans so if
you're<00:04:38.669> kind<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.000> nervous<00:04:39.330> about<00:04:39.479> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
you're kind of nervous about the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.240 
you're kind of nervous about the
observed<00:04:40.169> print<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.740> want<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.100> get

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
observed print but you want to get

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.310 
observed print but you want to get
something<00:04:41.669> I<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.389> a<00:04:42.419> good<00:04:42.690> bag<00:04:42.930> to

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320

something I think this is a good bag to
begin<00:04:43.680> with<00:04:43.950> because<00:04:44.780> obviously<00:04:45.780> all<00:04:46.290> those

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500

begin with because obviously all those
wonderful<00:04:47.160> features<00:04:47.669> that<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:47.940> noted<00:04:48.419> and
