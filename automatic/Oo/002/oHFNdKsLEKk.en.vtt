did pick up from the live stream was how

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.170 
did pick up from the live stream was how

our building the game particularly the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.220 
our building the game particularly the
Texas<00:02:28.159> office<00:02:28.819> which<00:02:29.030> are<00:02:29.209> doing<00:02:30.079> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
persistent universe aspect of it got

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.270 
persistent universe aspect of it got
some<00:02:33.079> really<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.530> good<00:02:33.739> insight<00:02:34.099> there

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
some really really good insight there

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
some really really good insight there
actually<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.420> things<00:02:35.689> was<00:02:35.930> his<00:02:36.200> arm

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
actually one of the things was his arm

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.550 
actually one of the things was his arm
is<00:02:36.950> how<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.370> planet<00:02:38.329> Ares<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.750> stations<00:02:39.290> will

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
is how the planet Ares and stations will

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.140 
is how the planet Ares and stations will
evolve<00:02:39.829> over<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.220> period<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.549> took<00:02:40.819> over<00:02:41.000> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
evolve over the period of took over a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
evolve over the period of took over a
time<00:02:41.450> for<00:02:42.290> example<00:02:42.799> let's<00:02:42.829> say<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.760> planet<00:02:44.720> was

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
time for example let's say a planet was

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.530 
time for example let's say a planet was
doing<00:02:46.220> relatively<00:02:46.670> well<00:02:46.819> because<00:02:47.299> there<00:02:47.450> was

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
doing relatively well because there was

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.569 
doing relatively well because there was
a<00:02:47.569> lot<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.750> people<00:02:47.900> trading<00:02:48.409> there<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.430> on

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
a lot of people trading there and so on

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.819 
a lot of people trading there and so on
and<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.819> on<00:02:49.909> and<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.049> would<00:02:51.200> see<00:02:51.439> that<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
and so on and you would see that in the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:52.960 
and so on and you would see that in the
economy<00:02:52.220> you'd<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.459> walking<00:02:52.640> around<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
economy you'd be walking around the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.300 
economy you'd be walking around the
streets<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.599> know<00:02:53.659> to<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.900> all<00:02:53.959> clean<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.680> so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
streets you know to be all clean and so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.979 
streets you know to be all clean and so
on<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.939> be<00:02:56.060> wealthy<00:02:56.239> people<00:02:56.569> walking

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
on so on to be wealthy people walking

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.500 
on so on to be wealthy people walking
around<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.889> still<00:02:58.099> get<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> idea<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.389> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
around you still get the idea so the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.569 
around you still get the idea so the
actual<00:02:59.629> planets<00:03:00.170> actually<00:03:00.470> evolved<00:03:00.980> based<00:03:01.370> on

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
actual planets actually evolved based on

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.399 
actual planets actually evolved based on
the<00:03:01.670> economy<00:03:01.909> another<00:03:02.569> scenario<00:03:02.810> might<00:03:03.139> be

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
the economy another scenario might be

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.220 
the economy another scenario might be
let's<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.430> say<00:03:04.670> some<00:03:05.150> trading<00:03:05.569> routes<00:03:05.900> fell

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
let's to say some trading routes fell

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.289 
let's to say some trading routes fell
between<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.650> particular<00:03:07.040> planet<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.790> after

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
between that particular planet and after

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.849 
between that particular planet and after
a<00:03:08.329> period<00:03:08.599> of<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.349> probably<00:03:09.620> see

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
a period of time you probably see

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.550 
a period of time you probably see
rubbish<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.519> street<00:03:10.879> you<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.720> caffee<00:03:12.319> on

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
rubbish on the street you see caffee on

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.890 
rubbish on the street you see caffee on
the<00:03:12.650> walls<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.489> all<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.329> sort<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.599> stuff<00:03:14.659> so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
the walls and all that sort of stuff so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.199 
the walls and all that sort of stuff so
you<00:03:15.019> actually<00:03:15.170> see<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:16.040> planet<00:03:16.670> change<00:03:16.909> so<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
you actually see a planet change so you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.020 
you actually see a planet change so you
might<00:03:17.420> visit<00:03:17.599> today<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.680> might<00:03:18.889> be<00:03:19.159> very

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
might visit today and it might be very

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.089 
might visit today and it might be very
wealthy<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.049> might<00:03:21.200> come<00:03:21.439> back<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.799> two<00:03:22.069> weeks

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
wealthy you might come back in two weeks

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.729 
wealthy you might come back in two weeks
or<00:03:22.400> weeks<00:03:22.579> time<00:03:22.849> or<00:03:23.239> go<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.139> want<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.379> say<00:03:24.530> few

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
or weeks time or go I want to say few

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.949 
or weeks time or go I want to say few
days<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> week's<00:03:25.519> time<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.840> would

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
days that a week's time and you would

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.199 
days that a week's time and you would
say<00:03:27.139> actually<00:03:27.200> see<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.709> depreciation<00:03:28.209> so

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
say actually see that depreciation so

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.390 
say actually see that depreciation so
you<00:03:29.269> might<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:30.160> think<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.280> things

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
you might have to think of things

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.830 
you might have to think of things
slightly<00:03:31.699> differently<00:03:31.819> when<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.449> go<00:03:32.569> into<00:03:32.750> a

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
slightly differently when you go into a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.539 
slightly differently when you go into a
planet<00:03:33.260> because<00:03:33.500> i'll<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.859> if<00:03:34.280> you're<00:03:34.430> going

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
planet because i'll see if you're going

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.610 
planet because i'll see if you're going
to<00:03:34.609> be<00:03:34.699> going<00:03:34.970> onto<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.239> planet<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:36.230> in

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to be going onto a planet and is in

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.099 
to be going onto a planet and is in
poverty<00:03:37.129> you<00:03:37.730> might<00:03:37.940> get<00:03:38.090> robbed<00:03:38.359> so<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.019> all

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
poverty you might get robbed so that all

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.659 
poverty you might get robbed so that all
these<00:03:39.260> scenarios<00:03:39.650> will<00:03:40.010> come<00:03:40.190> up<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.459> well

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
these scenarios will come up as well

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.119 
these scenarios will come up as well
which<00:03:40.849> is<00:03:40.879> really<00:03:41.000> exciting<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:42.139> new<00:03:42.530> xml

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
which is really exciting the new xml

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.520 
which is really exciting the new xml
tools<00:03:43.489> sort<00:03:44.419> of<00:03:44.510> for<00:03:44.659> being<00:03:44.840> developed<00:03:45.109> a<00:03:45.319> moat

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
tools sort of for being developed a moat

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.949 
tools sort of for being developed a moat
at<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.859> moment<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.370> help<00:03:46.669> create<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.180> new

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
at the moment to help create the new

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.379 
at the moment to help create the new
modulus<00:03:48.440> ship<00:03:48.980> systems<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.849> that's<00:03:50.150> going<00:03:50.329> to

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
modulus ship systems and that's going to

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.089 
modulus ship systems and that's going to
be<00:03:50.480> applied<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> couple<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.349> ships<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.889> we

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
be applied to a couple of ships so we

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.369 
be applied to a couple of ships so we
have<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.280> wait<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.579> see<00:03:52.750> how<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:53.930> turn<00:03:54.139> out

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
have to wait and see how they turn out

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.259 
have to wait and see how they turn out
we've<00:03:55.069> just<00:03:55.310> got<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.579> information<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:56.150> that

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
we've just got the information on that

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.360 
we've just got the information on that
so<00:03:56.389> we<00:03:56.479> don't<00:03:56.629> really<00:03:56.870> know<00:03:57.169> how<00:03:57.560> much<00:03:58.220> is

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
so we don't really know how much is

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.860 
so we don't really know how much is
there<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.609> be<00:03:58.669> supposedly<00:03:59.540> going<00:03:59.750> to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
there going to be supposedly going to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.449 
there going to be supposedly going to
better<00:04:00.019> change<00:04:00.349> from<00:04:00.590> roll-to-roll<00:04:01.069> quite

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
better change from roll-to-roll quite

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.069 
better change from roll-to-roll quite
easily<00:04:01.639> by<00:04:02.000> just<00:04:02.030> swapping<00:04:02.389> out<00:04:02.569> containers

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
easily by just swapping out containers

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.750 
easily by just swapping out containers
and<00:04:03.199> rooms<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:03.919> on<00:04:04.069> one<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.639> other

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
and rooms and so on one of the other

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.890 
and rooms and so on one of the other
things<00:04:04.819> they've<00:04:05.180> been<00:04:05.329> working<00:04:05.449> on<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:05.870> well

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
things they've been working on as well

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.129 
things they've been working on as well
is<00:04:06.409> making<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.849> manufactured<00:04:08.720> items

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
is making all the manufactured items

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.280 
is making all the manufactured items
look<00:04:09.590> like<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:09.949> brand<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.970> for<00:04:11.180> instance<00:04:11.290> if

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
look like the brand so for instance if

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.250 
look like the brand so for instance if
you<00:04:12.590> see<00:04:12.859> a<00:04:12.889> weapon<00:04:13.519> on<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.940> fourth<00:04:14.180> floor<00:04:14.479> if

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
you see a weapon on the fourth floor if

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.379 
you see a weapon on the fourth floor if
you<00:04:15.500> see<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> weapon<00:04:15.949> on<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> floor<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:17.180> should

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
you see a weapon on the floor you should

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.479 
you see a weapon on the floor you should
then<00:04:17.570> identify<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.409> as<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.799> particular<00:04:19.159> type

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
then identify that as a particular type

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.310 
then identify that as a particular type
of<00:04:19.519> manufacture<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.479> there's<00:04:20.659> going<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.930> be<00:04:20.959> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
of manufacture so there's going to be a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.560 
of manufacture so there's going to be a
particular<00:04:22.039> style<00:04:22.490> over<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.970> manufacturers

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
particular style over the manufacturers

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.240 
particular style over the manufacturers
sort<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.900> weapons<00:04:24.289> over<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> ships<00:04:24.979> and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
sort of the weapons over the ships and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.550 
sort of the weapons over the ships and
so<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.639> also<00:04:26.389> there's<00:04:26.599> been<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> lot<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.020> work<00:04:27.289> as

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
so on also there's been a lot of work as

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.740 
so on also there's been a lot of work as
well<00:04:27.770> on<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.130> body<00:04:28.580> damage<00:04:28.880> states<00:04:29.360> for<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
well on the body damage states for the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.350 
well on the body damage states for the
FPS<00:04:30.409> module<00:04:30.800> as<00:04:30.889> well<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.310> leg<00:04:31.520> arm<00:04:31.789> heads<00:04:32.120> and

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
FPS module as well so leg arm heads and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.180 
FPS module as well so leg arm heads and
so<00:04:32.539> on<00:04:32.720> that's<00:04:33.260> something<00:04:33.529> we're<00:04:33.800> going<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.010> be

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
so on that's something we're going to be

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.430 
so on that's something we're going to be
seeing<00:04:34.400> next<00:04:34.820> year<00:04:34.969> now<00:04:35.180> when<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.779> FPS<00:04:36.139> model

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
seeing next year now when the FPS model

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.230 
seeing next year now when the FPS model
comes<00:04:36.680> out<00:04:36.950> one<00:04:37.490> other<00:04:37.610> thing<00:04:37.729> that<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.120> i

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
comes out one other thing that you i

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.070 
comes out one other thing that you i
found<00:04:38.599> was<00:04:38.719> pretty

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
found was pretty

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.929 
found was pretty

building the RSI site I have started
working<00:04:44.300> on<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.449> galactic<00:04:45.069> level<00:04:46.069> sword<00:04:46.759> mat

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
working on a galactic level sword mat

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.869 
working on a galactic level sword mat
and<00:04:47.800> there<00:04:48.800> were<00:04:48.860> some<00:04:49.039> pictures<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.430> sort<00:04:49.819> of

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
and there were some pictures and sort of

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.580 
and there were some pictures and sort of
demonstrations<00:04:50.659> it<00:04:50.840> wasn't<00:04:51.110> actually<00:04:51.199> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
demonstrations it wasn't actually the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.050 
demonstrations it wasn't actually the
Galactic<00:04:51.949> map<00:04:52.129> but<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.400> was<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.520> demonstration

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
Galactic map but it was a demonstration

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.809 
Galactic map but it was a demonstration
of<00:04:53.449> what<00:04:54.169> they're<00:04:54.349> thinking<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.770> doing<00:04:54.919> very

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
of what they're thinking of doing very

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.240 
of what they're thinking of doing very
very<00:04:55.909> cool<00:04:56.419> now<00:04:57.110> with<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:57.439> technology<00:04:57.800> we've

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
very cool now with the technology we've

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.550 
very cool now with the technology we've
got<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:58.669> html5<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.750> bootstrap<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.469> all

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
got like html5 and bootstrap and all

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.040 
got like html5 and bootstrap and all
these<00:05:00.680> latest<00:05:01.009> technologies<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.870> can

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
these latest technologies you can

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.080 
these latest technologies you can
actually<00:05:03.169> go<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.560> quite<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.219> high<00:05:04.610> level<00:05:05.000> of

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
actually go to quite a high level of

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.770 
actually go to quite a high level of
detail<00:05:05.449> fidelity<00:05:06.050> now<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:07.039> if<00:05:07.969> the<00:05:08.330> Galactic

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
detail fidelity now so if the Galactic

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.959 
detail fidelity now so if the Galactic
map<00:05:08.960> if<00:05:09.110> they<00:05:09.259> can<00:05:09.409> update<00:05:09.590> that<00:05:10.009> map<00:05:10.280> let's

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
map if they can update that map let's

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.570 
map if they can update that map let's
just<00:05:11.180> say<00:05:11.330> for<00:05:11.360> instance<00:05:11.629> maybe<00:05:12.500> daily<00:05:13.069> hourly

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
just say for instance maybe daily hourly

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.909 
just say for instance maybe daily hourly
be<00:05:14.000> fantastic<00:05:14.719> you<00:05:15.229> could<00:05:15.379> actually<00:05:15.530> sit<00:05:15.889> a
