well<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.970> me<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.720> short<00:01:33.930> considering<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
well for me it is short considering my

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
well for me it is short considering my
hair<00:01:34.560> used<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.400> belly<00:01:35.579> button

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
hair used to go down to my belly button

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.780 
hair used to go down to my belly button
so<00:01:36.540> yeah<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.710> hair<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> lot

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.719 
so yeah this is my hair now it's a lot
shorter<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.390> me<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.700> really

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.080 
shorter for me and I actually do really
like<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.320> my<00:01:43.320> style<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.159> guess<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.670> don't

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like it I think my style I guess I don't

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.700 
like it I think my style I guess I don't
really<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.540> short<00:01:45.899> hair<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> almost

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
really do short hair but I almost

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.780 
really do short hair but I almost

considered going like to there but then

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.480 
considered going like to there but then
I<00:01:50.820> didn't<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.479> hopefully<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> just

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I didn't so hopefully if because I just

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
I didn't so hopefully if because I just
um<00:01:53.729> curled<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.470> messy<00:01:55.770> waves<00:01:55.890> hair

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.080 
what i would recommend asking for is
showing<00:03:07.920> pictures<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.489> helps<00:03:08.820> them<00:03:08.970> get

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
showing pictures really helps them get

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.400 
showing pictures really helps them get
an<00:03:09.209> idea<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.810> sometimes<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.260> you're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
an idea because sometimes what you're

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.479 
an idea because sometimes what you're
thinking<00:03:10.769> isn't<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.070> same<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.220> their

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
thinking isn't the same as their

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.759 
thinking isn't the same as their
thinking<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.090> then<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:13.110> kind<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.350> actually

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
thinking and then just kind of actually

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.080 
thinking and then just kind of actually
showing<00:03:14.040> them<00:03:14.250> where<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.549> want<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> layers

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
showing them where you want the layers

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
fridge since it is a little grease here

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.320 
fridge since it is a little grease here
that's<00:04:33.310> why<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.490> like<00:04:33.520> using<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:34.000> when<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.150> wear

straightening it or curling yet it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.510 
straightening it or curling yet it
doesn't<00:04:37.780> make<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.020> look<00:04:38.110> as<00:04:38.230> oily<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.280> then
