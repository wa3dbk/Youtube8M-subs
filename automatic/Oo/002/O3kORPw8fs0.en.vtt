used to it or you can make the sickest

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.970 
used to it or you can make the sickest
board<00:00:46.900> and<00:00:47.110> that's<00:00:47.230> what<00:00:47.380> we're<00:00:47.500> doing<00:00:47.620> so

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
board and that's what we're doing so

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.130 
board and that's what we're doing so
this<00:00:48.970> is<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.150> great<00:00:49.360> example<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.840> what<00:00:50.020> we'll

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
this is a great example of what we'll

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.660 
this is a great example of what we'll
get<00:00:50.260> from<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.530> rider<00:00:50.740> you<00:00:51.040> get<00:00:51.250> basically<00:00:51.550> a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
get from a rider you get basically a

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.030 
get from a rider you get basically a
sketch<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.450> lot<00:00:52.720> of<00:00:52.810> times<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.170> notepad<00:00:53.380> John's<00:00:53.950> a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
sketch a lot of times a notepad John's a

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.010 
sketch a lot of times a notepad John's a
little<00:00:54.220> more<00:00:54.370> specific<00:00:54.970> so<00:00:55.390> mark<00:00:55.690> will<00:00:55.870> pull

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
little more specific so mark will pull

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.050 
little more specific so mark will pull
it<00:00:56.140> into<00:00:56.290> his<00:00:56.890> program<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.820> basically

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
it into his program and basically

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.320 
it into his program and basically
recreate<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.580> tip<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:00.730> tail<00:01:00.910> profile

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
recreate that tip and tail profile

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330 
recreate that tip and tail profile
radiuses<00:01:01.900> for<00:01:02.320> John's<00:01:02.560> board<00:01:02.830> are<00:01:03.010> different

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
radiuses for John's board are different

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.619 
radiuses for John's board are different
than<00:01:03.460> anything<00:01:03.700> we've<00:01:04.000> ever<00:01:04.089> done<00:01:04.239> here<00:01:04.540> in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
than anything we've ever done here in

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.599 
than anything we've ever done here in
Sigma<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.530> actual<00:01:05.890> core<00:01:06.159> over<00:01:06.369> here

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
Sigma this is the actual core over here

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.609 
Sigma this is the actual core over here
and<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:06.999> is<00:01:07.179> the<00:01:07.420> core<00:01:07.659> scaled<00:01:08.020> up<00:01:08.229> ten<00:01:08.590> times

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
and this is the core scaled up ten times

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.739 
and this is the core scaled up ten times
so<00:01:09.399> we<00:01:09.490> can<00:01:09.640> see<00:01:09.909> how<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.210> varies<00:01:10.329> throughout

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
so we can see how it varies throughout

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.929 
so we can see how it varies throughout
the<00:01:10.929> length<00:01:11.079> of<00:01:11.289> it<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.590> starts<00:01:12.249> out<00:01:12.369> very<00:01:12.429> thin

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
the length of it it starts out very thin

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.789 
the length of it it starts out very thin
we<00:01:13.270> got<00:01:13.450> some<00:01:13.600> nice<00:01:13.749> radiuses<00:01:14.289> in<00:01:14.439> here<00:01:14.649> and

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
we got some nice radiuses in here and

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.109 
we got some nice radiuses in here and
then<00:01:14.890> plateaus<00:01:15.429> and<00:01:15.579> gets<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.759> little<00:01:15.880> bit

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
then plateaus and gets a little bit

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.789 
then plateaus and gets a little bit
thinner<00:01:16.329> towards<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.049> center<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> core

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
thinner towards the center of the core

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.179 
thinner towards the center of the core

California<00:01:22.569> I<00:01:23.200> love<00:01:24.069> that<00:01:24.850> we're<00:01:25.090> doing<00:01:25.210> a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
California I love that we're doing a

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.359 
California I love that we're doing a
series<00:01:25.719> of<00:01:25.869> five<00:01:26.229> boards<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:26.979> graphic

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
series of five boards and the graphic

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.399 
series of five boards and the graphic
spreads<00:01:27.700> over<00:01:27.909> each<00:01:28.149> one<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:28.689> each<00:01:29.079> one's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
spreads over each one so each one's

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.679 
spreads over each one so each one's
different<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.219> little<00:01:30.310> abstract<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.299> kind

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
different and a little abstract it kind

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.690 
different and a little abstract it kind
of<00:01:31.780> has<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:32.439> do<00:01:32.560> with<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.829> evolution<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.460> time

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
of has to do with the evolution of time

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.999 
of has to do with the evolution of time
and<00:01:34.149> being<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> present<00:01:35.499> and<00:01:35.679> looking

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
know is going to get written like

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.420 
know is going to get written like
nothing<00:01:43.100> else

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
nothing else
