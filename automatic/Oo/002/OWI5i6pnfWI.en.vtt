guide decisions across the organization

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.870 
guide decisions across the organization
that<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.289> nutshell<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:23.039> reputation

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
that in a nutshell is reputation

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.190 
that in a nutshell is reputation
management<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.599> I<00:04:24.659> think<00:04:24.870> that's<00:04:24.990> going<00:04:25.140> to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
management and I think that's going to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
management and I think that's going to
be<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.349> huge<00:04:25.500> focus<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:26.250> 2013

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
be a huge focus in 2013

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.590 
be a huge focus in 2013
well<00:04:29.220> apart<00:04:29.610> from<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.910> obvious<00:04:29.940> things<00:04:30.479> like

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
well apart from the obvious things like

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.689 
well apart from the obvious things like
up-to-date<00:04:31.229> photography<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.490> website

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
up-to-date photography and a website

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.370 
up-to-date photography and a website
that's<00:04:32.940> been<00:04:33.270> refreshed<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.990> last<00:04:34.169> five

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
that's been refreshed in the last five

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.110 
that's been refreshed in the last five
years<00:04:34.410> or<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.160> would<00:04:35.639> say<00:04:35.819> that<00:04:35.849> it's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
years or so I would say that it's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.969 
years or so I would say that it's
essential<00:04:36.539> for<00:04:36.569> hotels<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.319> have<00:04:37.470> an<00:04:37.650> SEO

to cover as many channels I really think

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.650

than pretty much any initiative listen
13<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.720> think<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:16.770> important<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.250> hoteliers

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
13 I think it's important for hoteliers

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.260 
13 I think it's important for hoteliers
to<00:05:18.090> recognize<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.400> consumer<00:05:21.090> will

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
to recognize that the consumer will

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.370 
to recognize that the consumer will
still<00:05:21.539> be<00:05:21.659> very<00:05:21.870> much<00:05:22.139> focused<00:05:22.680> on<00:05:23.060> value

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
still be very much focused on value

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.550 
still be very much focused on value

given the difficult recovery of the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.920 
given the difficult recovery of the
economy<00:05:28.789> and<00:05:29.789> when<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:29.970> say<00:05:30.210> value<00:05:30.599> i<00:05:30.630> don't

mean<00:05:31.110> lowest<00:05:32.070> price<00:05:32.389> but<00:05:33.389> I<00:05:33.419> mean<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:34.199> quality

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
mean lowest price but I mean the quality

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.770 
mean lowest price but I mean the quality
expectations<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.849> whole<00:05:36.030> equation<00:05:36.360> of

degree of quality for the price I think

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.800

all the clutter of the competition is
out<00:06:30.780> there<00:06:30.990> today<00:06:31.669> competing<00:06:32.669> in<00:06:32.909> this<00:06:33.090> tough
