00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.920
Sarge: Gentlemen. As I'm sure you know, today is a special day. Thanksgiving.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120
Grif: Awesome! When do we eat?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.180
Sarge: I thought that since today is an honored tradition, it would be appropriate to recreate the spirit of that original momentous day.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.200
Grif: Okay, we get it, less talking more eating.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.760
Sarge: Unfortunately it's been almost a thousand years now since the first Thanksgiving, so some of the little details have been lost to history.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.820
Grif: Yeah, okay. Now can we eat!?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.200
Sarge: But using the power of the internet, I was able to read a bunch of historical documents on the holiday,...

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.840
which for some reason were all authored by first-graders,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.040
and accompanied by drawings of their favorite Thanksgiving Day food:

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.460
severed human hands, that have been colored and dressed to look like birds.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.460
Simmons: What?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.780
Grif: Okay, uh, I'm not hungry anymore.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.520
Simmons: Saaarge, people didn't eat hands, they ate turkey.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.600
Little kids just drew turkeys by tracing their fingers.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.880
Grif: Where did he get the hands?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480
Sarge: Why would they do that? Turkeys look nothing like hands!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.760
Simmons: Because they're kids. I don't know, their teacher probably told them to do it.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.900
Grif: Seriously, where did he get the hands?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.400
Sarge: Well that's just ridiculous! Why would a teacher tell them that?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520
Hand-shaped turkeys; it's no wonder we lost the literacy wars!

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460
Grif: Where did he get the hands!?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420
Sarge: I'll bet all their other historical documents are wrong too.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.620
Simmons: You mean your online six year old historians might be wrong?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.580
Yeah, you might want to fact-check. What did they say?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.800
Sarge: I found another historian who said Thanksgiving was the day when all the Pokemons taught the Jedis how to grow crops.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.680
Simmons: No. Thanksgiving's the day the Settlers and Natives sat down at a table and shared a harvest meal together.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.920
That's why I took the liberty of inviting our mortal enemies, the Blues, to sit down with us today.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.060
Caboose: Hello.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.400
Simmons: Or just, the Blue. Since there's only one of them left.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.460
Sarge: Heh heh. Excellent plan, Simmons.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.200
Invite 'em to dinner, then shoot 'em in the back. Classic holiday gotcha.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080
Simmons: Sarge, that's not the spirit of Thanksgiving.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.540
Well, you know not until years later at least.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.740
Sarge: No shooting in the back? Worst. Dinner party. Ever.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.920
Simmons: We all brought dishes from our culture. Sarge, you brought your... awful, hand thing-

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.760
Caboose: Oh man I totally love those.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.200
Simmons: Grif you brought ...individually wrapped snack cakes and cheese dip.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.800
Grif: The traditional fare of my people.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.020
Simmons: And, I prepared a customary Native American meal of: maize. Yum.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.640
Grif: Awesome! What's maize?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.600
Simmons: It's like corn-
Grif: Yes!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.040
Simmons: But totally inedible.
Grif: Dammit.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.120
Wait, that means un-eatable, right?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.240
Simmons: Yes.
Grif: Dammit.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.900
Simmons: What did you bring Caboose?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.180
Caboose: I brought my Grandmother's famous hair pie!

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.220
Sarge: Hubuwyuguh- huh?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.240
Caboose: My Grandmother said her hair pie, was a huge hit with the soldiers, so I knew that it would be perfect for today.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.680
Grif: That's not- what?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.460
Caboose: When she was in college, she would give it to all the soldiers returning from war, and they loved it! It made her the most popular girl in town!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.180
She never told me the recipe though, so I had to make some guestimates.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.900
Sarge: Son, I think we need to have a talk about the culinary arts.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.960
And probably some other stuff that you should already know about.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.380
Caboose: Okay I love talking. *starts talking to Sarge*

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.820
Simmons: *sigh* Look at them together. That's the true Thanksgiving spirit.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.700
Grif: I think I'm gonna go lie down, and then throw up.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.660
Simmons: Which is also, another big part of Thanksgiving. Way to go, Grif.
Caboose:*off screen* I dreampt about that the other night.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.240
Sarge: *said something to Caboose*

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.580
Caboose: What!? Grandma, no!

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.240
Sarge: And don't even get me started on the gobble gobble.
