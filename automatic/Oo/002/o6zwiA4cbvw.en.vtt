00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.655
 Hey, that's mine, give it back to me! 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.485
 No way, it's my pinwheel. 

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:07.428
 You're an apple. 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.825
 What you said, I can't hear you. 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.012
 Wow, what's going on? 

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.022
 What the.. 

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.142
 Orange, I finally found you. 

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.240
 Who are you? 

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:23.469
 Orange, I'm you, from 2053. 

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.147
 What? 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.736
 I'm from the future. 

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.745
 - All right, wait. So you're me? -Yeah. 

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:32.887
 -And are you from the future? -Yeah. 

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:33.560
 Prove it. 

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.472
 Oranges, we don't have time. I have to warn you sooner ... 

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.562
 No, I don't listen until you can. 

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:41.099
 So the lightning that suddenly appears to me is not enough? 

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:42.244
 That could be a reflection of the mirrors. 

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.837
 What about my 2053 driver's license? 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.666
 It can be falsified, unconvincing. 

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:49.622
 I have this laser gun. 

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.173
 Poor Steve. 

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:54.840
 -You believe me now? -No, it's not enough. 

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.218
 And another thing I have with me 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.340
 is this shining wand. 

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:59.312
 What? The wand that shines. 

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:00.746
 You're really from the future. 

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.096
 That's what I'm trying to tell you. 

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:04.565
 - Will you give me a shining wand too? -No, we don't have time. 

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.541
 I'll exchange it for my new iPhone4. 

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:10.072
 I don't want to, I have an iPhone512. 

00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:11.472
 -And what about golf clubs? -No. 

00:01:11.997 --> 00:01:13.626
 I'll give you a pear for them. 

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.309
 No, nobody trades him for a pear 

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:16.248
 Just listen to me. 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.259
 -Good. -I was sent to protect you. 

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:20.794
 Protected? Who? 

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:22.800
 Before the evil ruler of the future he can 

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:23.962
 to move things through the mind. 

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:26.025
 If he kills you, I will never exist. 

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:28.902
 -Wait, why don't you exist? - Because I'm him. 

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:31.983
 -I'm an orange. -And I'm the future. 

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.978
 So why does he want to kill you? - He meant me. 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.078
 Because I'm the only one who can stop him 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.045
 but I need your help. 

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:39.344
 - And why mine? -You own one of the most powerful ... 

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.422
 weapons known to people or fruits. 

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:43.390
 -It's me? -No, you're not. 

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:45.521
 It's a pinwheel. 

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:48.244
 The only way to stop him. 

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:49.952
 You don't know yet, but when you do 

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:51.661
 you turn it right, it can destroy everything. 

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:53.581
 -Did you replace him with a shining wand? - Paid. 

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.445
 No, wait that pinwheel is mine. 

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:56.889
 Give it a pear, we don't have time. 

00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:58.437
 Yeah, give it a pear. 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.556
 No, I can't hear you. 

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.783
 - Come on, give it back to me. -Hey, pear. What are you doing? 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.881
 Give it to us. 

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:07.359
 -Give it to me. - Do it, give it to him. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.809
 -He's coming. -He's here. 

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.268
 Shit, he has a pinwheel. 

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:19.106
 Neee !!! 

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:25.823
 Who are you, why did you kill the oranges from the future? 

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:27.624
 Hey it's me. 

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:30.844
 -You're an orange. -And you're an orange. 

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:32.440
 I'm confused. 

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:33.903
 I was sent from the future 

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:35.664
 to protect you from the evil ruler of the future. 

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:36.751
 The other one said that. 

00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:39.426
 He was from a bad future 

00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:42.337
 he tried to convince you that I was the evil ruler 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.972
 but in fact it was him.
