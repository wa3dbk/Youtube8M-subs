got in my new LED fixture it's the rig
breeders<00:00:10.950> value<00:00:11.519> LED<00:00:12.889> my<00:00:13.889> tank<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.190> pretty

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
breeders value LED my tank is pretty

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.590 
breeders value LED my tank is pretty
simple<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.480> keeping<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.199> budget<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.680> mind

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
simple and I'm keeping a budget in mind

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.359 
simple and I'm keeping a budget in mind
so<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.900> why<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.080> went<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.380> something<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so that's why I went with something in

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.210 
so that's why I went with something in
my<00:00:20.580> opinion<00:00:20.970> really<00:00:21.150> took<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> cheap<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
my opinion really took the cheap and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.939 
my opinion really took the cheap and
should<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> job<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.910> fine<00:00:24.380> now<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
should do the job just fine now in this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
should do the job just fine now in this
video<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.730> pretty<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.390> an

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
video I'm going to do pretty much an

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
video I'm going to do pretty much an
unboxing<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> first<00:00:29.010> impressions<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
unboxing and a first impressions and a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.040 
unboxing and a first impressions and a
function<00:00:30.240> test<00:00:31.669> if<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.059> time<00:00:33.329> today<00:00:33.540> I'll

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
function test if I have time today I'll

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.979 
function test if I have time today I'll
go<00:00:34.290> ahead<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.739> make<00:00:35.520> some<00:00:35.969> type<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> hangar<00:00:36.960> or

go ahead and make some type of hangar or
something<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.780> get<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> tank<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.980> may

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
something to get this on the tank it may

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
something to get this on the tank it may
be<00:00:41.309> temporary<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> look<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
be temporary I'm gonna have to look and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.470 
be temporary I'm gonna have to look and
see<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.170> supplies<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> garage

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
see what supplies I have in the garage

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.590 
see what supplies I have in the garage
but<00:00:45.480> um<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> meantime<00:00:47.120> let's<00:00:48.120> take<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> look

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
but um in the meantime let's take a look

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:24.490 
but um in the meantime let's take a look
at

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.980 

-<00:01:25.500> powerchords<00:01:27.800> looks<00:01:28.800> like<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> comes<00:01:29.310> with

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
- powerchords looks like it comes with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.760 
- powerchords looks like it comes with
comes<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> carabiner<00:01:32.899> one<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.320> smaller

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
comes with a carabiner one to smaller

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.359 
comes with a carabiner one to smaller
clips<00:01:36.590> let's<00:01:37.590> say<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.830> can<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:38.250> than

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
clips let's say I can do better than

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.960 
clips let's say I can do better than
that

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.999 

come<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> carabiner<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:43.050> wire<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> hang

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
come to the carabiner some wire to hang

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.230 
come to the carabiner some wire to hang
it<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:45.000> few<00:01:45.450> clips<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.380> may<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.550> may<00:01:47.910> not<00:01:47.940> use

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it a few clips here I may or may not use

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.530 
it a few clips here I may or may not use
this<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.310> don't<00:01:50.310> know

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.980 

-<00:01:57.540> power<00:01:58.500> cords<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.330> it's<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.960> thing

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
- power cords and it's the same thing

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.469 
- power cords and it's the same thing
that<00:02:01.289> used<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.940> power<00:02:02.940> supply<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.570> computer

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
that used for power supply on computer

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.640 
that used for power supply on computer
ok<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
ok this is it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.199 
ok this is it
very<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:15.120> basic<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:16.519> it's<00:02:17.519> gonna<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
very very basic but it's gonna do the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:28.130 
very very basic but it's gonna do the
job<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.660> sure

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.650 

just<00:02:28.800> hold<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.130> my<00:02:29.310> hands<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.120> got<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> good

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
just hold it my hands it's got a good

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.600 
just hold it my hands it's got a good
weight<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.470> say<00:02:31.740> probably<00:02:32.040> weighs<00:02:32.370> as

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
weight to it I say probably weighs as

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.699 
weight to it I say probably weighs as
much<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.830> old-style<00:02:35.310> ps3's<00:02:36.709> well

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
much it's like the old-style ps3's well

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.790 
much it's like the old-style ps3's well
it<00:02:37.860> feels<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.340> sturdy<00:02:38.700> doesn't<00:02:39.150> feel<00:02:39.300> flimsy

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.350 

as<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.040> see<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.340> got<00:02:44.490> two<00:02:44.700> fans<00:02:45.090> in

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
as you can see it's got two fans in

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
as you can see it's got two fans in
there<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:47.959> white<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.770> blue<00:02:50.959> control<00:02:52.370> got<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
there a white and blue control got a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040 
there a white and blue control got a
little<00:02:53.670> detent<00:02:54.150> at<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:54.570> bottom<00:02:55.020> that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
little detent at the very bottom that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.800 
little detent at the very bottom that
powers<00:02:56.040> them<00:02:56.280> off<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.200> gives<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:59.810> quarter

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
powers them off and it gives you quarter

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
powers them off and it gives you quarter
adjustments<00:03:01.590> well<00:03:01.770> it's<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.760> full<00:03:03.090> range

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
adjustments well it's it's full range

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.610 
adjustments well it's it's full range
but<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:04.290> mark<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:04.739> they're<00:03:05.330> 25<00:03:06.330> 50<00:03:06.660> 75<00:03:06.690> 100

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:23.530 

doesn't<00:03:13.620> look<00:03:13.739> too<00:03:13.950> bad<00:03:20.000> no<00:03:21.000> instructions

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
doesn't look too bad no instructions

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.199 
doesn't look too bad no instructions
most<00:03:24.540> people<00:03:25.400> probably<00:03:26.400> wouldn't<00:03:27.090> need

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
most people probably wouldn't need

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:36.800 
most people probably wouldn't need
instructions<00:03:27.870> anyway

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.880 

not<00:03:37.410> too<00:03:37.620> much<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.830> show<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.430> thing<00:03:39.890> is

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
not too much a show on this thing is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.580 
not too much a show on this thing is
simple<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:44.190> several<00:03:48.290> all<00:03:49.290> right<00:03:49.440> now

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
simple and I like several all right now

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.240 
simple and I like several all right now
let's<00:03:50.420> take<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.480> look<00:03:51.660> at<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> LEDs<00:03:52.350> during<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
let's take a look at the LEDs during the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.050 
let's take a look at the LEDs during the
function<00:03:53.640> test<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:55.430> looked<00:03:56.430> at<00:03:56.580> each<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.850> every

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
function test I looked at each and every

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.520 
function test I looked at each and every
one<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:59.030> all<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.390> soldering<00:04:00.840> looks<00:04:01.140> really

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
one and all the soldering looks really

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.949 
one and all the soldering looks really
good<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.890> consistent<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:03.270> craftsmanship

that<00:04:03.990> ship<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.770> this<00:04:04.920> thing<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.400> phenomenal

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
that ship of this thing is phenomenal

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.550 
that ship of this thing is phenomenal
for<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.040> cheap<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.700> mean<00:04:09.540> I'm<00:04:09.750> I'm<00:04:10.020> really

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
for to be so cheap I mean I'm I'm really

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.010 
for to be so cheap I mean I'm I'm really
impressed<00:04:10.830> with<00:04:11.160> it

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
impressed with it

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.180 
impressed with it
so<00:04:13.220> back<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.520> up<00:04:15.470> let's<00:04:16.470> take<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.680> look<00:04:16.980> at

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
so back it on up let's take a look at

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.150 
so back it on up let's take a look at
the<00:04:18.120> LEDs<00:04:21.320> alright<00:04:22.320> now<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.530> figured<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:22.980> thing

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
the LEDs alright now I figured one thing

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.250 
the LEDs alright now I figured one thing
out<00:04:23.310> -<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.730> have<00:04:23.880> two<00:04:24.090> knobs<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:25.020> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
out - you have two knobs on the on the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.800 
out - you have two knobs on the on the
top<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:26.160> for<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> white<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.120> add

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
top of it one for the white and add

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.530 
top of it one for the white and add
white<00:04:28.230> LEDs<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.370> one<00:04:29.520> for<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.669> blue<00:04:30.380> each

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
white LEDs and one for the blue each

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.390 
white LEDs and one for the blue each
color<00:04:33.540> type<00:04:33.990> has<00:04:34.380> its<00:04:34.410> own<00:04:34.680> fan<00:04:34.980> that's<00:04:35.280> why

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
color type has its own fan that's why

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.490 
color type has its own fan that's why
there<00:04:35.550> are<00:04:35.580> two<00:04:35.669> fans<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:37.020> fans<00:04:37.050> don't

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
there are two fans and the fans don't

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.000 
there are two fans and the fans don't
kick<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.830> until<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.460> go<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:39.090> at<00:04:39.240> least<00:04:39.450> 25%<00:04:40.200> on

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
kick on until you go to at least 25% on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.940 
kick on until you go to at least 25% on
the<00:04:41.520> LEDs<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.229> you<00:04:43.229> may<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.440> able<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> hear<00:04:43.890> it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
the LEDs and you may be able to hear it

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.090 
the LEDs and you may be able to hear it
in<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.100> video<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.370> don't<00:04:44.520> know<00:04:44.729> but<00:04:45.120> uh<00:04:46.100> yep

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
in the video I don't know but uh yep

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.990 
in the video I don't know but uh yep
you'll<00:04:47.370> see<00:04:47.550> first<00:04:48.270> let's<00:04:48.540> do<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.720> blues<00:04:49.400> oh<00:04:50.400> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
you'll see first let's do the blues oh I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.190 
you'll see first let's do the blues oh I
don't<00:04:51.270> know<00:04:51.330> if<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.479> said<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.810> LA<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
don't know if I said in LA but the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.770 
don't know if I said in LA but the
exposure<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.770> not<00:04:53.100> gonna<00:04:53.640> be<00:04:53.820> locked<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.600> the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
exposure is not gonna be locked so the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.710 
exposure is not gonna be locked so the
camera<00:04:55.169> is<00:04:55.290> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.590> compensate<00:04:56.540> for<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
camera is going to compensate for the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.140 
camera is going to compensate for the
for<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.169> brightness<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.650> IDs<00:05:01.729> blues<00:05:02.729> only

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
for the brightness of the IDs blues only

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.630 
for the brightness of the IDs blues only
it's<00:05:03.300> just<00:05:03.450> gonna<00:05:03.540> take<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.780> second<00:05:04.229> to<00:05:04.350> adjust

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
it's just gonna take a second to adjust

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.380 
it's just gonna take a second to adjust
I'm<00:05:05.640> gonna<00:05:05.820> go<00:05:05.970> up<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.200> 25%

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.820 

as<00:05:12.990> soon<00:05:13.410> as<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.650> hear<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:15.120> look<00:05:15.420> for<00:05:15.630> me<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:16.710> be

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
as soon as I hear you look for me to be

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.460 
as soon as I hear you look for me to be
specific<00:05:17.040> it's<00:05:17.550> at<00:05:17.700> like<00:05:17.880> 26<00:05:18.540> or<00:05:18.660> 27<00:05:18.930> percent

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
specific it's at like 26 or 27 percent

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.350 
specific it's at like 26 or 27 percent
before<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.800> fan<00:05:19.980> kicks<00:05:20.250> on<00:05:20.660> but<00:05:21.660> on<00:05:22.620> up<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.890> 50%

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.530 

hit<00:05:27.360> probably<00:05:27.630> all<00:05:27.780> looks<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.050> same<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.470> guys

75 and a hundred yeah looking at the
camera<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.840> pretty<00:05:37.020> much<00:05:37.110> looks<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> same

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
camera it pretty much looks the same

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.540 
camera it pretty much looks the same
once<00:05:37.890> the<00:05:38.070> exposure<00:05:38.760> is<00:05:39.410> adjusted<00:05:40.410> but<00:05:41.310> I

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
once the exposure is adjusted but I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.180 
once the exposure is adjusted but I
assure<00:05:42.060> you<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.630> bright<00:05:45.680> yeah<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.800> can<00:05:46.980> see

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
the camera I'm gonna do the same thing

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.440 
the camera I'm gonna do the same thing
for<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.050> white<00:05:52.230> entities<00:05:55.820> fan<00:05:56.820> is<00:05:57.000> on<00:05:57.150> at<00:05:57.360> 25%

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
for the white entities fan is on at 25%

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.910 
for the white entities fan is on at 25%
I'll<00:06:00.450> skip<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.930> lowest<00:06:01.260> setting<00:06:01.590> but<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.770> made

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
I'll skip the lowest setting but I made

I'll skip the lowest setting but I made
it<00:06:02.070> it's<00:06:02.520> gonna<00:06:02.640> look<00:06:02.790> the<00:06:02.910> same<00:06:02.970> on<00:06:03.240> the

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
it it's gonna look the same on the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.960 
it it's gonna look the same on the
camera<00:06:03.600> regardless<00:06:04.080> as<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:04.770> can<00:06:04.920> see<00:06:05.160> they
