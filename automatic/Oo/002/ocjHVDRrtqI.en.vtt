00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
little bit so it's going to be a little

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.910 
little bit so it's going to be a little
bit<00:04:35.330> damp<00:04:35.690> because<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.260> water<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.740> going<00:04:36.860> to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
bit damp because that water is going to

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.270 
bit damp because that water is going to
help<00:04:37.190> absorb<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.450> oil<00:04:38.480> into<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.350> follicle
