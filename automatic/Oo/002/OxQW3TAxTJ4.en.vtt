00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.970
 today you need to conquer new young 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:20.990
 the public and it seems like a novice director 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:24.140
 Already found an approach to her claim to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.800
 quality cinema for 40 in the audience 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.860
 which works in general at the expense of a friend 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.479
 other clear conclusion of the denouement 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.330

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.580
 mindless who dream 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.890
 for below I donâ€™t have a specific path in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.240
 such as directing all that 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.700
 practically connected with it festival vgik 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.400
 holiday is not only student 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.240
 at the cinema inspection comes and professionals 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.040

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.270
 future colleagues and of course 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.550
 remember youth remembered 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.950
 such diploma performances by elekklimov

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.970

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.960
 work with talented people 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.990
 for me the underlying cause 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.540
 is of course with someone at the festival 3 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.420
 competition programs international in 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.700

 kids surveyed interested even with 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.780
 since I was a student myself 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.150
 mid seventies along with 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130

 Eshpaya today Vladimir Sergeevich 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.240
 notice that 40 years later young 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.680
 worries all the same in the eternal theme 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.040
 often the subject of student paintings 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.710
 she or about her youth life what 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.520
 also a good relationship there with more 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.380
 adults or 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 starts you think something up there 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.360
 then horror movies or something 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.330
 greece spain france china in 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.120

 school of the world seems to me that the most 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.080
 interesting at the festival is not happening 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.720
