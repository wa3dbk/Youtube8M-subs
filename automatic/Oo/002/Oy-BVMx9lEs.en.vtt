00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
a liner a very very thin liner and I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
a liner a very very thin liner and I
don't<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.450> haven't<00:01:22.080> taken<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> liner

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because I don't really need to it's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
because I don't really need to it's
still<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.830> cold<00:01:26.130> outside
