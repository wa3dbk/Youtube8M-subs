00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.340
 this is unclear 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.650
 relationship passport is

 identifying such illegal trading 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.870
 points can fine entrepreneurs 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.360
 at least every day 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.340
 and if the same seller gets caught 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.849
 three times that thing can turn it 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.849
 criminal
