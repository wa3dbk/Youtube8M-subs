00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.440
 a dramatic closure as they have already reported today in the study and from the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.020
 principle because there is a shot to the post very early to the team goalkeeper 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.660
 algeria 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.639
 the amount of clear occasions that come to have a tendency in this game in the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.390
 changes that he was recently anxious on the bench he was dying of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.330
 want to do something else but it does not end the team willow 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 taking it out with great determination if something characterizes this team is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.390
 winning mentality and determination 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.400
 it would have been very unfair that he will stay out team the United States will be of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.550
 agreement 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.109
 yes yes really anyway 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.369
 it's true that the United States played better it's true that it made the wear and tear 

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.740
 physical and who managed the game 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.620
 maybe this one in the first five seven minutes not with him with that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.200
 pelotazo is sure that player of the doll of athens on the crossbar 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 prologue united states efe made foot inside the game reign and started to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.470
 to play better it seems to me that what happened to us that he sinned of anxiety 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.600
 ep we saw that in several occasions of the party is for example one of altidore 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.010
 that he takes away the ball has praised do not go just had a clear chance 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.370
 the Gol 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.690
 they have rushed have tried to close the game before 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.760
 the ghosts also arrived when when they cancel this traverse of a 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.830
 goal in an advanced position c gomez that did not seem yes yes and they had I think 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.820
 a little 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.000
 d had to have put a little bit the brake anyway as I said 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.670
 it seems just like this claiming another era to get to asia nor did he have the help macbook 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.210
 He also had his distance but he was hurrying to jaguar but 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 united states was more united states wanted more united states was always 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 forward 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.540
 and at times he appeared complacently calm they did not hurry the minute 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.610
 He saw that we know that he does not despair and that he knows that he ends up when he blows 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.530
 the referee and there appeared his great figure bill figure this match 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.259
 putting the goal because the figure for me is the four is still bradley not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.009
 to run does not stop playing who keeps saying that he did not swear because 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 is the son of does not seem to see the back match really stoner and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 better for Americans that must be seen 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.259
 the lands you already step on from and you realize 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.329
 step on his own area and reach the boundaries of the brave rival area 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.030
 realizing with the reservoirs done that is the player that quique like this the exit that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.129
 drag problems that have a vision of the game 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.170
 to organize the offensive the united states and something important states 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.840
 united that free throw if it will involve nodding he will also caress 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.459
 also has for that is a full goal another stopped several absences 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.180
 for that match he had to change to Phillis a new starting striker because 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.840
 he takes out an unfair card 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.780
 yellow in the previous match and also something that called us the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.830
 attention and says I told you the Russian lineup tella monte tdt called 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.959
 to the comment 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.060
 percent started maurice edu and sat joseph francisco towers leaving him 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.450
 just to vladdy 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 responsible for the recovery of the ball from the initial proposal 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.800
 the united states was going to win the game and understanding that they possess left-back 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.390
 that plays if I'm not wrong made today the chiva iuesei 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.930
 is more offensive than defensive attacks more than what defines pose 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.060
 Too risky 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.960
 against an algeria that if he won the match he also had a chance to 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.910
 get in and I got out united states I liked worked came dublino refers to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.090
 the court and helped at times changing position buy yourself when 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.200
 plant and he was leaving he was no net offensive team that we 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.230
 worries bravo see but like good proposal also the prize does not stop 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.550
 move away from finishing first of cadet group of 1930 that does not end 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.529
 transferred percent first because it looks like it's a prize 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.809
 to the effort to the little offensive that this team has and to the good ones 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.269
 players who also this one 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.859
 as the Russian said when you work a lot 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.839
 the fruits appear here I keep insisting with what I said 'if I 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.599
 American mentality is less harmful for access up to mind a 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.399
 team that has been appearing in world cups since 1990 to date 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.769
 much has changed by a hundred what was united states in that world 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.270
 Italia'90 with several players including police 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.100
 to what he could be and it's not strange to see them in the quarterfinal round 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.569
 because they already did 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.610
 in 2002 in Korea-Japan 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.289
 soybean paste arrived 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.429
 we can not forget
