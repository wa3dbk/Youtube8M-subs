and there you go you've created a MySQL
database<00:06:06.630> just<00:06:07.259> like<00:06:07.440> that<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.949> now<00:06:08.310> what

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
database just like that and now what

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.700 
database just like that and now what
will<00:06:08.610> happen<00:06:08.910> is<00:06:09.060> once<00:06:09.570> we<00:06:09.750> get<00:06:10.020> into<00:06:10.229> the

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
will happen is once we get into the

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.189 
will happen is once we get into the
files<00:06:11.009> of<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.759> folder<00:06:12.180> we<00:06:12.300> uploaded<00:06:12.720> we're

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
files of that folder we uploaded we're

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.260 
files of that folder we uploaded we're
going<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.410> be<00:06:13.470> able<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.770> access<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.850> install

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
going to be able to access the install

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.999 
going to be able to access the install
file<00:06:15.570> and<00:06:15.840> it's<00:06:15.960> going<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.139> ask<00:06:16.289> us<00:06:16.500> for<00:06:16.770> some

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
file and it's going to ask us for some

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.100 
file and it's going to ask us for some
of<00:06:17.130> this<00:06:17.190> information<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.060> MySQL<00:06:18.750> so

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
of this information for the MySQL so

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.300 
of this information for the MySQL so
that's<00:06:19.259> why<00:06:19.380> you<00:06:19.440> needed<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.800> go<00:06:19.860> ahead<00:06:20.039> and

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
that's why you needed to go ahead and

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.680 
that's why you needed to go ahead and
create<00:06:20.520> this<00:06:20.759> so<00:06:21.000> that'll<00:06:21.240> be<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.389> next<00:06:21.630> step

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
create this so that'll be the next step

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.779 
create this so that'll be the next step
is<00:06:21.960> when<00:06:22.530> we<00:06:22.650> actually<00:06:22.830> go<00:06:23.280> into<00:06:23.460> internet

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
is when we actually go into internet

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.850 
is when we actually go into internet
explorer<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.389> we<00:06:24.840> go<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.199> domain<00:06:25.530> and<00:06:25.740> we

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
explorer and we go to the domain and we

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.440 
explorer and we go to the domain and we
find<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.430> install<00:06:26.940> folder<00:06:27.570> for<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.139> form
