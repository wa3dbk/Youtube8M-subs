flights getting ready what we're looking

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.330 
flights getting ready what we're looking
for<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.760> saw<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:19.050> end<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.890> April

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
for is I so I saw you know end of April

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.000 
for is I so I saw you know end of April
very<00:00:20.760> end<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> april<00:00:21.480> may<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.930> may<00:00:22.170> second<00:00:22.619> yeah

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
very end of april may be may second yeah

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.740 
very end of april may be may second yeah
I'm<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.460> second<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.510> probably

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I'm a second you know that's probably

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.650 
I'm a second you know that's probably
safer<00:00:25.140> bet<00:00:25.910> traditionally<00:00:26.910> you're<00:00:27.449> always

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
safer bet traditionally you're always

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660 
safer bet traditionally you're always
looking<00:00:27.930> kind<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> into<00:00:28.380> may<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.580> know

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
looking kind of into may know you know

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.040 
looking kind of into may know you know
but<00:00:29.849> usually<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> first<00:00:30.390> week<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> May<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
but usually the first week in May you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
but usually the first week in May you
can<00:00:31.199> probably<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.279> some

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
can probably get out there with some

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
can probably get out there with some
success<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.270> says<00:00:33.450> once<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> ice<00:00:34.050> breaks

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
success and one says once the ice breaks

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
success and one says once the ice breaks
the<00:00:34.590> smelt<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:34.980> start<00:00:35.190> running<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> salmon

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the smelt will start running and salmon

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.869 
the smelt will start running and salmon
will<00:00:36.600> follow<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.640> at

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
will follow them up and then really at

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.069 
will follow them up and then really at
that<00:00:38.910> point<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.390> depends<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.960> water

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that point it just depends on water

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
that point it just depends on water
temperatures<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.190> how<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> rivers

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
temperatures and then how the rivers

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
temperatures and then how the rivers
come<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> come<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.290> right<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.040> you'd

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
come up and come down so right and you'd

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
come up and come down so right and you'd
like<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:44.820> strong<00:00:45.059> flow<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.510> water

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
like to see a good strong flow of water

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
like to see a good strong flow of water
oh<00:00:45.960> absolutely<00:00:46.320> yeah<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.460> obviously

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
oh absolutely yeah you know obviously

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
oh absolutely yeah you know obviously
you<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.390> anything<00:00:48.420> crazy<00:00:48.930> which

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you don't want see anything crazy which

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
you don't want see anything crazy which
we<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.250> certainly<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we have we have certainly had that in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
we have we have certainly had that in
the<00:00:51.120> past<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.690> no<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:52.590> definitely<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> good

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the past but no yeah definitely a good

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
the past but no yeah definitely a good
run<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.670> which<00:00:53.969> we've<00:00:54.270> had<00:00:54.449> plenty<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.079> snow

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
run off which we've had plenty of snow

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
run off which we've had plenty of snow
plenty<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> cells<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.820> should<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
plenty of cells so that should be that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
plenty of cells so that should be that
should<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.010> should<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.250> any

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
should be good and that should be any

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
should be good and that should be any
problems<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> mean<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.539> everything<00:01:00.780> goes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
problems there I mean if everything goes

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
problems there I mean if everything goes
well<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.590> should<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> solid<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.789> three

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
well we should have a solid two three

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479 
well we should have a solid two three
you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> upwards<00:01:04.530> even<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> month<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you know upwards even a month of a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
you know upwards even a month of a
decent<00:01:06.030> salmon<00:01:06.330> fishing<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.619> we're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
decent salmon fishing and then we're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.810 
decent salmon fishing and then we're
always<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> salmon<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> river

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
always going to salmon in the river

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450 
always going to salmon in the river
after<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.180> anyway<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
after that anyway so but but with the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
after that anyway so but but with the
salmon<00:01:11.729> run<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> spring<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> little

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
salmon run in the spring it's a little

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
salmon run in the spring it's a little
different<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.310> bait<00:01:14.520> fish<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.939> spawning

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
different the the bait fish are spawning

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
different the the bait fish are spawning
oh<00:01:15.600> absolutely<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> smelter

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
oh absolutely you get the smelter

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.649 
oh absolutely you get the smelter
spawning<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.450> key<00:01:18.630> thing

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
spawning and that's that's the key thing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
spawning and that's that's the key thing
that's<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.740> brings<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> salmon<00:01:20.460> up

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that's what really brings the salmon up

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
that's what really brings the salmon up
into<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> river<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.320> happens<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> right

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
into the river so what happens is right

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
into the river so what happens is right
after<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> Ice<00:01:23.610> goes<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.750> y<00:01:24.900> atento<00:01:25.229> woke

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
after the Ice goes out the y atento woke

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
after the Ice goes out the y atento woke
up<00:01:25.619> ever<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.100> slightly<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.119> smell<00:01:27.450> will<00:01:27.570> start

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
up ever so slightly the smell will start

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.060 
up ever so slightly the smell will start
to<00:01:27.990> come<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.470> they'll<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to come in and they'll really want to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.830 
to come in and they'll really want to
come<00:01:29.189> into<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> inlet<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> they<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.780> too

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
come into the inlet so they don't go too

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
come into the inlet so they don't go too
far<00:01:31.170> upstream<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.799> very<00:01:32.009> good<00:01:32.159> swimmers<00:01:32.579> but

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
far upstream are very good swimmers but

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.190 
far upstream are very good swimmers but
that's<00:01:32.939> where<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.420> their<00:01:33.630> gravel

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that's where they have all their gravel

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.140 
that's where they have all their gravel
and<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.409> where<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.710> spawn<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.790> once<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and that's where they spawn so once the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.760 
and that's where they spawn so once the
smelt<00:01:36.420> start<00:01:36.659> getting<00:01:36.930> into<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> inlets<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
smelt start getting into the inlets the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
smelt start getting into the inlets the
the<00:01:38.009> salmon<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.180> constantly

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the salmon which you know constantly

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450 
the salmon which you know constantly
feed<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.140> many<00:01:40.380> ways<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.770> follow<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
feed on many ways will follow them in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
feed on many ways will follow them in
there<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.299> they'll<00:01:42.450> stay<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
there and then they'll stay in there and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
there and then they'll stay in there and
they'll<00:01:43.200> feed<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.590> long<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> smelt<00:01:44.220> stay

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
they'll feed as long as the smelt stay

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.389 
they'll feed as long as the smelt stay
there<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.240> salmon<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.720> stay<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
there the salmon will stay there and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.830 
there the salmon will stay there and
consequently<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.700> end<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.970> getting<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.329> good

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
consequently if we end up getting a good

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
consequently if we end up getting a good
flow<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.649> smell<00:01:50.310> stay<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> while

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
flow and this smell stay up for a while

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.719 
flow and this smell stay up for a while
once<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> smell<00:01:52.290> start<00:01:52.640> dissipating<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
once the smell start dissipating and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
once the smell start dissipating and
going<00:01:54.000> back<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> dying<00:01:55.380> off<00:01:55.590> pretty<00:01:55.860> much

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going back and and dying off pretty much

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490 
going back and and dying off pretty much
again<00:01:56.280> eaten<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> salmon<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.140> stay<00:01:58.290> there

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
again eaten the salmon will stay there

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.080 
again eaten the salmon will stay there
as<00:01:58.649> long<00:01:58.860> as<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.700> insect

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
as long as we have a good insect

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.480 
as long as we have a good insect
population<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.189> long<00:02:02.340> as

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
population what do we do and as long as

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.679 
population what do we do and as long as
the<00:02:02.579> water<00:02:02.790> flow<00:02:02.969> stay<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the water flow stay good and the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
the water flow stay good and the
temperatures<00:02:04.049> stay<00:02:04.170> good<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.469> mean<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
temperatures stay good I mean then that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
temperatures stay good I mean then that

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
some of those bigger fish to those 20 22

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.580 
some of those bigger fish to those 20 22
24<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.299> there<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.049> like<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
24 is up there and this is like it's a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
24 is up there and this is like it's a
good<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.610> bigger<00:02:50.819> fish<00:02:51.060> they're<00:02:51.269> usually

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
good so the bigger fish they're usually

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180 
good so the bigger fish they're usually
at<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> beginning<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.290> run<00:02:52.440> they'll<00:02:52.980> come

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
at the beginning of the run they'll come

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.580
