00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.860
 e 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 and 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.799
 hi everyone so here is a 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.490
 video about call of duty ghost on xbox 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.629
 360 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.099
 so in fact it's not a video 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.800
 gameplay it's miso a video of 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:24.060
 presentation of the game so menus of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.320
 disarm the assets of the game modes and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.290
 it is so we will start with 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.130
 campaign so there is really a beautiful 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.210
 intro start really well done 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 so what that has as mission 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.850
 you 're going to see as a nation are there so 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.030
 the first is fast enough that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.230
 runs pretty fast so I did the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.480
 two for now in normal mode 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.289
 that's where already it's a presentation of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.550
 is another campaign 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:59.729
 the multiplayer mode so maps etc 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.670
 after i will show you the squad mode and 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.960
 extraction mode 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.370
 of course I will do gameplay on it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 there are no worries so you can 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.250
 put boots create a soldier so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.760
 I show you who you do all this 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760
 that there is like a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:24.320
 so the knife attacks them all 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.740
 weapons etc 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.440
 the big machine guns the snaps that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.840
 gunshots the real snipers are 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.460
 the real snipers way of talking so 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.460
 I can show snipers in detail 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.550
 howe is also there are men who have 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.150
 predefined accessories finally you 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 can not remove them here rifles 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.670
 with pump and riot shield 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.180
 so I find it really stylish when 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.869
 he takes a weapon hop he throws it 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.610
 he takes them another bad ass and also 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.009
 secondary weapons so with a 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.230
 small submachine gun pd w the magnum and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.450
 other weapons so come up with 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 accessories attachments so there he 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.330
 are there anything else as accessories they 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.950
 are not very numerous but it goes in 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.310
 have you put up to three 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.049
 accessories wait we'll put one on 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.950
 change the ridiculous laser sight 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.690
 here is really a lot at 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.670
 discover lit triangle is where 6 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.030
 can we choose up to 8 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 yes you have heard him at all 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.530
 so every one at all is a number 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.160
 how to say seeing this asset there that 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.209
 I selected worth two that one 5 and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.750
 that one four passes in the if you 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.160
 take one we will remove everything hop hop 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 if you can not take him who in 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.060
 worth 1 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.840
 but you can also for example in 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.329
 take 4 which is worth two here or 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.360
 otherwise one could only take two 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.220
 assets so it's really we can 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.700
 really customize the assets it's 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.610
 really a crazy thing 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.170
 also here are the stuff in assault so 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.920
 excuse me for my english really 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.099
 badass voilÃ  ms 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.819
 a dog that follows you yes sentry gun 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:43.900
 so that's equivalent to the moab messous 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:47.380
 who does not kill we do it so that's it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.790
 a month behemoth you can read 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.019
 English I'll let you look 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.380
 you put pose on the video and you 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.380
 look 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.650
 ah we can have support from people who 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.450
 protect you so it's really going to be 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.840
 weird because we can actually have 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:18.440
 an ally during the fight having 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 started and ed on it actually looks like a 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.300
 dead key but that resemble those of 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.450
 c4 good you hear me you do not have 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.010
 understood in fact it's a dead key but 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.980
 in fact someone comes down 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.640
 explodes after the tactical stuff and 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.060
 so here I present you the maps and 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.510
 prison break game modes 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.880
 hauptmann tremor fright I started 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.730
 start again whiteout excuse me for my 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.450
 also really focus to shit stand 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:57.500
 fronte seats even to hook up will save 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:03.110
 overlord stone avesnes chasm blur of this 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.370
 trail zoo here and game modes i'm going 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.669
 to say it in French like that it will be 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.020
 better one against a general mishmash 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.600
 team death match search and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.880
 destruction domination illuminations 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.150
 confirmed these chains risk you say 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.970
 say causa you're looking for stuff that's 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.180
 really not bad grein what is it already 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.180
 it 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.169
 there are really a lot of new 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:40.169
 players to me to infect that it's not 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:42.620
 yes ok bad at all be sought 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.870
 weapons ok I really have a lot of 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.949
 many modes of play alternate mode 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.949
 his guards 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:06:00.570
 ok ok so here I present you quickly 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.350
 options so that's pretty much the 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.840
 same as on the previous ones then 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.330
 the method of extraction, which is not bad 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.139
 all jeffrey or of course gameplay 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:18.840
 on it we can improve where there is 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:20.270
 level you have 4.4 to all you 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.820
 can change them as you go 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.380
 when you change the level so I 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.009
 believe that there is about 30 level but I 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.320
 I'm not 100% sure 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.669
 so that's really a lot of stuff 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.500
 who after you want you can 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.120
 improve dangerous when I had 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.580
 skill points and you 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.580
 put where you put them 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.840
 busy on the wall up to 4to can 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.700
 improve a new life 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.000
 really a lot of stuff we can play 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.030
 to two split screen and I do not know 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.550
 how much 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.170
 ok I created an unvarnished party hopes 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.330
 here is the end of this video 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.180
 I hope this little video 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.640
 presentation of cause you will have pleased me 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.600
 would of course have other gameplay on it 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.820
 no other gameplay it's not nothing 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.620
 but hey that was fabi I you
