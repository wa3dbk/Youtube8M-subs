00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.450
 hello welcome to all and welcome 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.820
 to the analysis of the last and the best 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.619
 trailer of gta 5 of the three that have been 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.510
 shown today is that of trevor and we're going to 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.689
 start the first thing we see is to trevor 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.939
 howling like a wolf towards asia that 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.010
 the moon or whatever it is believed 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.480
 I was a werewolf and with this alone I already 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.820
 liked this trailer more than the other two 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.680
 The truth is that I already knew that I was going 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 to love the trevor trevor trailer 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.309
 is my favorite character good at 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.710
 beginning of the trailer we have a 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.690
 sort of town like that in the desert that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.790
 will be where trefoil lives your house 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.250
 we also see that trevor has a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930
 scar on the belly in the area here 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.330
 a little up I do not know what it will be 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.800
 and maybe it's explained in the game and 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.040
 is talking to someone you do not know 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.190
 exactly to whom and scratch here I have 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.659
 stopped and good in addition to the piece 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.280
 hit that has been carried in the face to 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.680
 this guy the other thing he wanted 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.290
 highlight here is the jacket of this 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 uncle I think that puts of lost is the group of 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.799
 bikers who had in gta 4 because of 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.900
 the hood is not visible but you can tell 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.780
 start with d then there is a space for 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 letters and then it ends with this one 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.270
 it will be that the bikers who were called 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.530
 the lost come back from card 4 just like 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.509
 in trailer 2 they saw two that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.920
 It looked like they were from the angel's of 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.350
 death maybe they will face again 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.690
 here these two bands of bikers and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.909
 we will see to see what happens here we see the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.710
 Trevor's truck here dirty so that 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.780
 he wants to clean things up trevor is 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.920
 truth and behind we see a tractor what 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.509
 I just saw right now I swear to you 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.130
 when I saw the trailer I did not see it while 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.899
 I'm talking right now about the car 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.580
 trevor I just saw it come back again 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.140
 the tractors just like there was the san 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.960
 Andreas, the tractors come back in 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.630
 gta 5 finally let's go forward and 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.160
 this tribe hugging michael because 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.140
 is to the extent that Michael returns to the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.340
 city ​​are best friends among them and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.600
 of course he is happy that he returns to the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.550
 city to come, let's go back to 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.200
 steal things and travel you right 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.610
 I have no idea who he is we see 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.440
 trevor riding a plane and then to 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.819
 trevor flying over a river and what 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
 that there are around the river I do not know 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.380
 exactly what it is could be a 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.180
 golf course because I'm watching there 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.850
 things like it was sand but good 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.140
 It will be a park or something strange as following 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.090
 forward we see Trevor attacking 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.489
 a poor passer-by and if you look at 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.630
 the car in the back seems to have a 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.850
 skirt 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.470
 these are tuned because it stands out 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.300
 in front of a way like it does in 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.280
 some who had the saga of children 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 speed and this could give us clues other 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.080
 time as in trailer 2 that you can 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.270
 tunear in elgeta 5 again again the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.980
 cars and right after this we see a 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.420
 an old lady who is trying 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.880
 hit with a bag to trevor because 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.990
 tremor will be attacking her husband in the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.360
 next scene what we see is a 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.070
 trevor torturing a person and good 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 3 x hitting more people as long as 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.540
 Shamrock comes out in a trailer or is sticking 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.250
 someone is not crazy about that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.230
 is the best protagonist is that I do not know 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.630
 not you see how many you say me try 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.460
 my favorite protagonist is michael who 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.080
 not that trevor is much more cool but not 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.370
 you see now you will arrive later in 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.620
 this trailer and you will see how cool it is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.480
 more here he put a guantazo that this 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.160
 itchy in the face that you do not see this is 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.260
 almost worse than a punch because this 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 itching that you have left there is a stinging in 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.090
 the face for more than a day here we see 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.460
 amanda michael's wife telling 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.650
 michael that keeps tremor away that 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.390
 he is afraid of him and trevor to talking to 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.790
 michael's woman saying to and what 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.670
 nice tits that has good trevor here 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.800
 in underpants climbing by I do not know 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.320
 where will they have left you? 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.170
 drunk I know in the east channel of 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.850
 the saints and it will be going up as you can 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.290
 and good with this scene is already 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.180
 confirmed that the lost return 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.310
 because there in the background there is a 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.560
 large graffiti that puts of the temps 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.720
 and the saints before which put 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.750
 liberty city in gta 4 well here is the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.130
 the seat they have in the saints is 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.290
 the same biker gang that 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.150
 I belonged neither the protagonist of the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
 lost and time then we see trevor 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.880
 walking that has burned something with a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.590
 gas can 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.910
 again talking to michael with a lot 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.100
 different clothes again I come back to 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.810
 insist on this will again see quite 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.010
 more clothes than in gto 4 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.440
 it is not known if as much as in the san 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 andreas but more than in the 4 there will be and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.770
 Well, from here, it starts 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.570
 What's more cool of the trailer we have gone up in 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.730
 the wing of an airplane firing towards 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.739
 back a kind of persecution or me 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.720
 I know what will be happening here and good 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.060
 just jump at the last moment and you see 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.220
 a ray behind this has been the pick 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.990
 but come on, this has not seen any 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.630
 another gta not even to cj towards the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.130
 things that cool so much is that there is no god 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.910
 mine you are not seeing that trevor is the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.500
 best 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.110
 well here we finally see something of 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.580
 desert for a scene that they put us 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.250
 from the desert you see sand here 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.220
 some weeds out there and trees 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.840
 small but very little is seen then 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.030
 forward we see how trevor pulls 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.129
 pilot of a helicopter this I do not know how 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.319
 will have risen to the best will have skipped the 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.090
 helicopter and has been climbing up the 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.770
 door has entered and the uncle has thrown 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.419
 this let's go I mean he has jumped 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 from a bridge where the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.689
 helicopter and you could grab it or I do not know 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.819
 what this has been, maybe it's a 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.770
 mission or something has to be but has 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.509
 stolen a helicopter in flight 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.580
 then the next scene also of 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.129
 are you cool I do not understand this because 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.110
 he has done it is crashing a car 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.819
 front against a train this I do not know 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.009
 exactly what you want to do 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.360
 maybe derail the train and it 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.060
 can do again in 4 no 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.949
 derailed good in fact nothing could 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.750
 stop to the subway but in the san andreas and 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.000
 you could derail a train already what 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.830
 better in 5 you can do it again 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.629
 that and good later we see a 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.909
 person here all tattooed I do not know if it's a 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.800
 was geox was painting surely what 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.879
 more sure is that painting because there 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.159
 you have to be crazy to 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.930
 tattoo that for life though good 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.860
 we see in the ear a dilated so 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.860
 Maybe yes 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.949
 here I have been silent in this area of 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.210
 bring because in this last sentence you have 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.520
 saying 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.710
 trevor if I understood it well speaks so 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.419
 fast but good I think he said 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.499
 I want to get my take out should I do not know 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.310
 it acquires is that I get the 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:57.669
 cock 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.520
 so that it stops will be for 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.300
 prove something or not, because what is 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.169
 refer 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.499
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.259
 this analysis also of trevor and good 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:10.060
 Well, it's over, I 've already taken all the 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.770
 late working on these three analyzes 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.509
 and well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.509
 And until next time
