 most stationary how c is crazy 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.049
 which is good here and in a register 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.610
 everything in there and once it smells 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.720
 that's what wanted to keep 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.650
 finally return Tréflez in marshes 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.820
 system and central security of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 breathing before it's done 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.210
 restored by a kitchen guy from your 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.009
 computer there you are ignored and that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.259
 will launch automatically and you 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.030
 worry it goes and another 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.040
 computer there will be full full full 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.380
 of museum serret lasted about a half 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.489
 time to download 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 is called more one expects fromelles 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.600
 had he had strong matter that's 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.600
 really 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 because I had put about three 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.410
 hours are found to 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.390
 then can be even more difficult 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 because you do not have to m 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.890
 if you bought your computer 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.770
 nine good apart maybe pack them from 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.180
 outside and better in May 9 inside 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.470
 frankly he will really put 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.050
 your hard drive will be really good and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.990
 so is you sometimes only one thing 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.460
 which is not serious is that you are going 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:51.390
 in your search engine by 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:59.070
 example google see it for example movie 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:01.140
 is marked and that's so see there 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.800
 always at the controls and on that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.520
 you are going to type 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 they know this problem well because that 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.570
 take no memory in their 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.570
 computers 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 we see it there and it allows us to act as 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.670
 if the transat air and the class of humor 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.850
 too long list has plunged into 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.430
 the swamps the same you go on a 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:32.700
 survival on a windows 7 that's 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.470
 the computer but without threatening posts 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.630
 working 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.760
 there in there there you go see your 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.420
 disc you right click on it 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:48.120
 and there you see the training but he 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.700
 did not leave that here for hollywood 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.650
 but that if you do formatted I think 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.680
 that it does not work because one and already 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.490
 did the test had not worked but times 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.070
 it's only once in two but without 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:09.120
 transformer of fear that he has a 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:11.520
 format problem in it's trainer 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.830
 your computer and so I hope it is 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:20.810
 that you remember pulls us out on 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.810
 help you and there and so 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.520
 necessarily good it was not subscribe 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.270
 light painting and commented often said 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.319
 in the comments 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.210
 and so the next video will be a little 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.690
 failed gameplay for you live 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.940
 that's what I directly film with 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.819
 my laptop bad quality laptop 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.750
