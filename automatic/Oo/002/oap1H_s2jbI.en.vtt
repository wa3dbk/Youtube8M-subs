00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
threw it on the trickle charger for like

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.520 
threw it on the trickle charger for like
a<00:00:04.440> day<00:00:04.620> here<00:00:04.890> says<00:00:05.250> charged<00:00:05.930> so<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:08.059> see<00:00:09.530> plug

all<00:00:26.070> winning

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:00.610 

whether<00:00:50.800> governments

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:38.029 

Oh

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.399 

well<00:01:39.039> scary<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.939> definitely<00:01:40.420> think<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.869> being

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
well scary I definitely think that being

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.260 
well scary I definitely think that being
a<00:01:41.500> short<00:01:41.740> circuited<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.700> wasn't<00:01:43.090> working

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
a short circuited it wasn't working

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.029 
a short circuited it wasn't working
quite<00:01:43.600> right<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.109> that<00:01:44.409> pretty<00:01:44.799> much

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
quite right and that pretty much

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.779 
quite right and that pretty much
confirms<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:46.259> should<00:01:47.259> probably<00:01:47.829> disconnect

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
confirms it should probably disconnect

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.620 
confirms it should probably disconnect
that<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.530> USB<00:01:51.069> charger<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.759> I<00:01:51.789> had<00:01:52.060> for

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
that that's a USB charger that I had for

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
that that's a USB charger that I had for
my<00:01:52.840> bike<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:53.740> looks<00:01:53.920> like<00:01:54.069> something's<00:01:54.429> uh

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
my bike but it looks like something's uh

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.859 
my bike but it looks like something's uh
maybe<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.520> little<00:01:57.549> miswired<00:01:58.119> in<00:01:58.450> there<00:01:58.630> because

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
maybe a little miswired in there because

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.539 
maybe a little miswired in there because
there's<00:01:59.170> definitely<00:01:59.380> smoke<00:01:59.950> streaming<00:02:00.429> out

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
there's definitely smoke streaming out

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.600 
there's definitely smoke streaming out
of<00:02:00.579> that<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:01.179> it<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.740> kind<00:02:03.039> of<00:02:03.130> working<00:02:03.369> on<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
of that and it is kind of working on the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.249 
of that and it is kind of working on the
fritz<00:02:03.909> on<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.630> off<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.390> summer<00:02:07.780> there<00:02:07.990> like

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
fritz on and off and summer there like

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.449 
fritz on and off and summer there like
it<00:02:08.379> would<00:02:08.470> try<00:02:08.619> my<00:02:08.649> phone<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.340> would

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
it would try my phone and then I would

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.309 
it would try my phone and then I would
just<00:02:09.610> stop<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:09.849> then<00:02:10.209> would<00:02:10.360> start<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.110> maybe

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
just stop and then would start so maybe

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.449 
just stop and then would start so maybe
there<00:02:11.590> must<00:02:11.799> be<00:02:11.920> some<00:02:12.069> kind<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.280> loose

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
there must be some kind of loose

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.140 
there must be some kind of loose
connections<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.269> that's<00:02:14.220> short<00:02:15.220> no<00:02:15.459> but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
connections in there that's short no but

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.229 
connections in there that's short no but
I<00:02:16.450> guess<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> replace<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:19.120> was

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
I guess I have to replace that it was

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.030 
I guess I have to replace that it was
handy<00:02:19.599> though<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.819> scary<00:02:23.010> definitely<00:02:24.010> uh

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
handy though but scary definitely uh

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.759 
handy though but scary definitely uh
gonna<00:02:24.790> disconnect<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.390> now<00:02:25.720> all<00:02:26.470> right<00:02:26.560> guys

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
gonna disconnect that now all right guys

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.059 
gonna disconnect that now all right guys
so<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.040> pulled<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.549> USB<00:02:28.590> charging<00:02:29.590> unit

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
so I pulled out that USB charging unit

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.800 
so I pulled out that USB charging unit
that<00:02:30.190> started<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.640> smoke<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.090> there<00:02:31.269> maybe

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that started to smoke in there maybe

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800 
that started to smoke in there maybe
it's<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> real<00:02:32.590> thick<00:02:33.480> molding<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.660> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it's got the real thick molding on it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.839 
it's got the real thick molding on it
but<00:02:34.959> maybe<00:02:35.230> I'll<00:02:35.440> cut<00:02:35.650> into<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.160> see

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
but maybe I'll cut into that and see

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.789 
but maybe I'll cut into that and see
like<00:02:37.269> if<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> wire<00:02:37.720> shorted<00:02:38.260> out<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.560> there<00:02:38.709> or

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
like if the wire shorted out in there or

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.129 
like if the wire shorted out in there or
something<00:02:39.190> which<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.209> suspect<00:02:40.720> because<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.049> was

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
something which I suspect because it was

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.860 
something which I suspect because it was
that<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.440> spread<00:02:41.709> eclis<00:02:42.160> uh<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that can spread eclis uh in the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.650 
that can spread eclis uh in the
summertime<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.359> yeah<00:02:46.359> definitely

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
summertime there but yeah definitely

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.990 
summertime there but yeah definitely
don't<00:02:47.019> want<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:47.530> him<00:02:47.709> catch<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.639> on<00:02:48.730> fire

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't want that for him catch it on fire

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.870 
don't want that for him catch it on fire
in<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.299> bike<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.489> start<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.819> up

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
in the bike so see if we can start it up

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:49.850 
in the bike so see if we can start it up
again

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.830 

here<00:03:50.580> we<00:03:50.640> go<00:03:50.730> guys<00:03:50.880> after<00:03:51.210> a<00:03:51.270> lot<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.510> cutting<00:03:51.690> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
here we go guys after a lot of cutting I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.680 
here we go guys after a lot of cutting I
got<00:03:52.050> into<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> but<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:52.770> see<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:54.480> due

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
got into that but you can see just due

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.260 
got into that but you can see just due
to<00:03:54.840> faulty<00:03:55.080> components<00:03:55.830> probably<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
to faulty components probably on the the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.470 
to faulty components probably on the the
PCB<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.250> caused<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.550> short-circuit<00:04:00.120> on

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
PCB here caused the short-circuit on

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.030 
PCB here caused the short-circuit on
that<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.140> can<00:04:01.290> see<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> inside<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040

that you can see the inside of the
housing<00:04:02.250> where<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.700> was<00:04:03.200> starting<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.350> melt

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
housing where it was starting to melt

housing where it was starting to melt
there<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:06.150> probably<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:07.940> crappy

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
there and probably just crappy

caused<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.540> short<00:04:12.870> probably<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.590> was

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
caused the short probably it was

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.260 
caused the short probably it was
probably<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.160> cold<00:04:14.430> causing<00:04:15.150> the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
probably just the cold causing the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.150 
probably just the cold causing the
circuit<00:04:15.690> board<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.080> components<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.650> expand

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
circuit board and components to expand

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.580 
circuit board and components to expand
and<00:04:17.750> probably<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.780> cracked<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.230> solder<00:04:19.470> joint

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
and probably just cracked a solder joint

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.800 
and probably just cracked a solder joint
or<00:04:19.890> something<00:04:19.920> caused<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.760> short<00:04:21.390> circuit<00:04:21.450> in

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
or something caused a short circuit in

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.560 
or something caused a short circuit in
that<00:04:22.019> but<00:04:22.550> yeah<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.640> sucks<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.000> lot<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.240> pick<00:04:24.420> up

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
that but yeah it sucks a lot to pick up

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.380 
that but yeah it sucks a lot to pick up
something<00:04:24.840> else<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.380> can<00:04:25.680> use<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.210> plug<00:04:27.210> in

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
something else that I can use to plug in

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.510 
something else that I can use to plug in
the<00:04:27.510> USB<00:04:27.720> device<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.590> use<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.070> charge<00:04:29.310> my

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the USB device so I use it to charge my

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.190 
the USB device so I use it to charge my
phone<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:30.000> when<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.180> use<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.540> GPS<00:04:30.780> or

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
phone there when I use like GPS or

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.600 
phone there when I use like GPS or
sometime<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.620> fall<00:04:31.830> in<00:04:31.920> on<00:04:32.040> going<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> ride

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
sometime I fall in on going for a ride

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.820 
sometime I fall in on going for a ride
but<00:04:33.480> uh<00:04:33.540> yeah<00:04:34.020> I'll<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.410> replace<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
but uh yeah I'll have to replace that

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.460 
but uh yeah I'll have to replace that
good<00:04:35.280> thing<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.490> caught<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:36.990> didn't

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
good thing I caught it you know I didn't

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.550 
good thing I caught it you know I didn't
burn<00:04:37.770> my<00:04:37.830> bike<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.280> ground
