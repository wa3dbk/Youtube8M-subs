00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
probably do it I do about 10-12 reps on

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.200 
probably do it I do about 10-12 reps on
this<00:00:19.949> exercise<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.970> again<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.289> me

this exercise and again you know with me
I'm<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:25.099> that<00:00:26.099> concerned<00:00:26.369> about

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
I'm not really that concerned about

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.439 
I'm not really that concerned about
trying<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.500> real<00:00:28.740> heavy<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.240> see

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
trying to go real heavy here as you see

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.260 
trying to go real heavy here as you see
I'm<00:00:30.570> doing<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.019> 35<00:00:31.619> pounds<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.940> doing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
I'm doing just 35 pounds I'm not doing

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.650 
I'm doing just 35 pounds I'm not doing
16<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.320> doing<00:00:34.680> 70<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.510> not

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
16 I'm not doing 70 you know it's not

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
16 I'm not doing 70 you know it's not
about<00:00:36.930> how<00:00:37.320> much<00:00:37.530> weight<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.219> or

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
about how much weight I can do or

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
about how much weight I can do or
nothing<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.140> I'm

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
nothing like that so that's why I'm

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
nothing like that so that's why I'm
doing<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.590> 35<00:00:41.010> pound<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> part<00:00:41.760> that's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
doing the 35 pound on this part that's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.799 
doing the 35 pound on this part that's
why<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.360> doing<00:00:42.690> 10<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> 12<00:00:44.100> reps<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.210> once<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
why I'm doing 10 to 12 reps so once I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
why I'm doing 10 to 12 reps so once I
finish<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.280> three<00:00:48.350> three<00:00:49.350> sets

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
finish these these are three three sets

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
finish these these are three three sets
I<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.539> favorite<00:00:53.149> bicep<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.930> met

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
I go on to my favorite bicep we met

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.130 
I go on to my favorite bicep we met
which<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.920> feel<00:00:56.190> feel<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> best<00:00:57.360> peak

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
which I feel feel is the best peak

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
which I feel feel is the best peak
builder<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.370> world<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.000> nothing

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
builder in the world and there's nothing

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
builder in the world and there's nothing
else<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.960> pretty<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.469> compares<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
else that pretty much compares with it

my exercise on the cable crossover

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160 
my exercise on the cable crossover
instead<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.060> cross<00:01:06.240> no<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> cable

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
instead of cross no one with the cable

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.649 
instead of cross no one with the cable
I'm<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> standing<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:07.920> doing<00:01:08.790> curls

that<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.420> they're<00:01:19.140> real<00:01:19.380> slow

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that I'm as I do this they're real slow

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.830 
that I'm as I do this they're real slow
and<00:01:20.009> controlled<00:01:20.159> movements<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:22.369> wait

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
and controlled movements and then wait

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.649 
and controlled movements and then wait
you<00:01:24.890> always<00:01:27.080> took<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.729> stack<00:01:29.729> frame<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.299> too

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you always took the stack frame but too

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
you always took the stack frame but too
much<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> bottom<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> stack<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.520> fully

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
much of bottom of the stack I'm fully

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
much of bottom of the stack I'm fully
extending<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.570> arms<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
extending my arms that I go down and

extending my arms that I go down and
when<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> come<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.479> pretty<00:01:36.720> much<00:01:36.960> touching

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
when I come up I'm pretty much touching

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.890 
when I come up I'm pretty much touching
my<00:01:37.770> ear<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.340> touching<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.210> side<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.600> my<00:01:39.720> head

as<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.259> come<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.759> doing<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:43.100> slow

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
as I come to so I'm doing for slow

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
as I come to so I'm doing for slow
controlled<00:01:45.119> movements<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:46.320> using<00:01:46.740> I'm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
controlled movements you're using I'm

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
controlled movements you're using I'm
trying<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.520> peak<00:01:47.820> contraction<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
trying to get peak contraction here and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
trying to get peak contraction here and
I'm<00:01:49.439> not<00:01:49.619> doing<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.040> whole<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.460> weight

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I'm not doing a whole lot of weight

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
I'm not doing a whole lot of weight
either<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.299> only<00:01:51.479> doing<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:52.040> matter

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
either here I'm only doing about matter

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.429 
either here I'm only doing about matter
of<00:01:53.130> fact<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:53.579> doing<00:01:53.970> my<00:01:54.060> 25<00:01:54.600> pounds<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
of fact I'm only doing my 25 pounds and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340 
of fact I'm only doing my 25 pounds and
here<00:01:55.920> again<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> myth<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.200> don't

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
here again you know the myth you don't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.060 
here again you know the myth you don't
really<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> do

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really have to do

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
really have to do
all<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.430> heavy<00:01:59.730> weight<00:01:59.900> if<00:02:00.900> you're<00:02:01.200> doing

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
all that heavy weight if you're doing

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
all that heavy weight if you're doing
good<00:02:01.830> slow<00:02:02.300> controlled<00:02:04.250> movements<00:02:05.250> peaked

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
good slow controlled movements peaked

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.020 
good slow controlled movements peaked
with<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:06.930> peak<00:02:07.350> contraction<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.490> that's<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
with a peak contraction and that's the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.540 
with a peak contraction and that's the
most<00:02:09.179> important<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.350> doing<00:02:11.130> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
most important thing here is not doing a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.900 
most important thing here is not doing a
lot<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.910> heavy<00:02:12.060> weights<00:02:12.530> for<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.770> six<00:02:14.190> five

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
lot of heavy weights for like six five

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.480 
lot of heavy weights for like six five
reps<00:02:15.330> with<00:02:15.959> bad<00:02:16.170> form<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:17.070> doing<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:18.380> nice

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
reps with bad form is doing a nice

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.560 
reps with bad form is doing a nice
amount<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.640> weight<00:02:20.790> something<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.390> can

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
amount of weight something that you can

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.170 
amount of weight something that you can
control<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:23.370> least<00:02:23.430> doing<00:02:24.050> 10<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.080> 12<00:02:25.560> 12<00:02:26.370> reps

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
control at least doing 10 to 12 12 reps

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.080 
control at least doing 10 to 12 12 reps
with<00:02:28.080> good<00:02:28.380> slow<00:02:29.280> movement<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.680> with

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
with good slow movement and with
