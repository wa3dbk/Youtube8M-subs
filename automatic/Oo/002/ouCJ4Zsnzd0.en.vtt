00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 hello to you sir, Modest Flavors from the kitchen greetings, loves 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.640
 In this section, the beautiful district of Nevsehir ... 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.120
 we have a nice soup recipe "Bulgurlu Wedding Soup" 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.720
 but if you want to learn the necessary materials first 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.920
 1 cup pilaf bulgur 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.480
 red lentils in half cup 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 half a cup of chickpea 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.600
 100 grams of ground meat 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.160
 1 piece of dry onion 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.840
 1 tablespoon of tomato paste 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.080
 1 coffee cup oil 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.440
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 and 8 cups of water 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280
 For the above; 1 tbsp butter 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.160
 1 tsp dry mint 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.400
 and 1 teaspoon of chili peppers 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.960
 now we have learned the necessary ingredients for our soup 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.080
 let's go to the quarry for construction 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 we put the fire in the pressure cooker 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 1 coffee cup leaving liquid oil 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 actually we don't have to fry the meat. 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.960
 but we have seen it fit to do such an operation in terms of being delicious 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 roasting 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.240
 minced meat, as we say, no roasting process in the original recipe 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.480
 but we want to be delicious, we also roast the onions a little 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 after adding a little bit of tomatoes, we add tomato paste 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.360
 we are also turning a few turns 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 Now we're hanging in the chickpea ... 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.440
 bulgur and red lentils that we wash together ... 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 Let's add some salt 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 Let's have a bottom-up like this 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.560
 this way we are increasing the taste of roasting 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
 a very easy recipe 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.200
 Now we're adding 8 cups of water 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.560
 we are closing the cover 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.440
 we start to boil, we will close 10 minutes later 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.600
 boiling point, fever 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.280
 10 minutes in our pressure cooker is enough 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 10 minutes later 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.920
 for our soup; 1 tablespoon of butter thoroughly scrape the pan into the pan 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.640
 add peppers and dried mint 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.920
 keep the oil on fire until it melts 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.840
 our soup is cooked, now service time 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 open the lid and mix it 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 transfer 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.920
 made pretty easy, nutritious, beautiful recipe 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.200
 we've prepared on the peppermint oil pepper 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 Let's eat with pleasure 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.440
 We shared a local soup recipe from Urgup 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.240
 We learned how to make "Bulgurlu Wedding Soup" 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.600
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.400
 goodbye...
