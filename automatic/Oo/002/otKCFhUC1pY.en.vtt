00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
on all the way and we'll still get a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.780 
on all the way and we'll still get a
little<00:03:36.680> acoustic<00:03:36.890> sound<00:03:37.370> because<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:37.640> have

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
little acoustic sound because I have

00:03:37.790 --> 00:04:00.630
