00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.890
 Many people ask how to set up 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.410
 the guitar 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 when there is no tuning fork when there is no hearing no 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 experience not guitars cheap like mine on 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.949
 help coming your technology hi 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.529
 iphone with droid about android 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.810
 I do not know on iPhone about the pony world in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 stories have this app called 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 legs sticking out but there are still many analogs 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.150
 this world seemed comfortable most 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.520
 practical parties for free and run 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.540
 and so guitar hero means but here it seems 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 the neck is kind of like a jet of meaning pegs 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 auto mode is not auto in principle 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.050
 easy to understand and runs here 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 the arrow she shows if goes to this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 side then let the string if you that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.059
 side tu we pull markings on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 so there are basically sides 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560
 understandable for example how the guitar sounds 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.940
 now 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.120
 and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.120
 you 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.949
 nonsense in short everything let's understand 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.949
 set up grinko 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.760
 and 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.050
 maximum light green color here 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.740
 green here he says he is 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.840
 is configured 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 here the green lights come on that are ready 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.220
 He speaks . that is, we do not confuse that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 what country touched what no 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 here here are four strings ready 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 the same tune tuned guitar delov 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 for a couple of seconds the rest is also done 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 two sides 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 I hope it will be useful for you 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.000
