00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
middle one and that's just going to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.119 
middle one and that's just going to
continue<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> pick<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> put

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so at first might look a little bit

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.529 
so at first might look a little bit
messy<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> go<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.329> pull

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
messy but as you go on you just pull

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
messy but as you go on you just pull
tighter<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.079> you'll<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.030> good

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
tighter and you'll actually see the good

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
tighter and you'll actually see the good
break<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> do

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
break for me so you're just going to do

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.900 
break for me so you're just going to do
that<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> keep<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.039> picking<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.879> putting

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and I'll always making really tight just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.730 
and I'll always making really tight just
continue<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:29.900> you're<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> read

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.270 

and<00:01:35.659> always<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.140> needs<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> stay<00:01:37.979> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and always the right needs to stay at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.450 
and always the right needs to stay at
the<00:01:38.400> top<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.000> head<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.979> always<00:01:41.100> close

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the top of the head so it's always close

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.810 
the top of the head so it's always close
to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> top<00:01:43.070> you're<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.550> that

I'm<00:01:48.020> always<00:01:49.020> pulling<00:01:49.470> tighter<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.930> braid

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
I'm always pulling tighter the braid

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.710 
I'm always pulling tighter the braid
gets<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.830> bit<00:01:53.100> bigger<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
dry and the brave near the end it'll

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.230 
dry and the brave near the end it'll
continue<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.900> will<00:02:42.080> stop<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.970> continued<00:02:43.970> go

continue it will stop and continued go
down<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.390> go<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.530> downwards<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.500> spin

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
down so go so downwards you just spin

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.040 
down so go so downwards you just spin
and<00:02:55.880> now<00:02:56.030> we're<00:02:56.240> almost<00:02:56.450> done<00:02:58.750> now<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.810> don't

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
pick up any more from the bottom you're

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.150 
pick up any more from the bottom you're
just<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.080> pick<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.290> from<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.620> top<00:03:03.830> so

here and then we're just going to finish
that<00:03:07.810> with<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.960> regular<00:03:09.620> braid

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.699 

okay<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.840> then<00:03:19.930> you're<00:03:19.990> just<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> tie

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
okay and then you're just going to tie

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.949 
okay and then you're just going to tie
that<00:03:21.040> off<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:24.000> place<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.300> out<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> way<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
that off and place it out of the way to

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.699 
that off and place it out of the way to
the<00:03:26.200> front<00:03:27.330> okay<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:29.200> then<00:03:29.319> you're<00:03:29.500> going<00:03:29.650> to

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the front okay so then you're going to

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.860 
the front okay so then you're going to
go<00:03:29.830> back<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.280> start<00:03:31.150> side<00:03:31.569> where<00:03:31.780> you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
go back to the start side where you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.480 
go back to the start side where you
started<00:03:32.260> your<00:03:32.380> rate<00:03:32.590> you're<00:03:33.010> going<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.280> brush

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
started your rate you're going to brush

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.660 
started your rate you're going to brush
out<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:34.000> left<00:03:34.569> hit<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.290> hair<00:03:35.980> here<00:03:36.430> and

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
out this left hit this hair here and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.910 
out this left hit this hair here and
it's<00:03:36.940> going<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.569> about<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:38.110> little<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.770> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
it's going to be about a little to the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's going to be about a little to the
middle<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.730> hair<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.180> going<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.390> stop

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
middle of the hair it's going to stop

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600 
middle of the hair it's going to stop
there<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.680> then<00:03:41.800> you're<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.400> take

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
there so then you're just going to take

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.180 
there so then you're just going to take
a<00:03:42.880> little<00:03:43.150> section<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:44.500> another<00:03:44.620> braid

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
a little section and do another braid

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.610 
a little section and do another braid
right<00:03:45.670> next<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.360> first<00:03:46.660> one<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.590> just

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
right next to the first one so just

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.170 
right next to the first one so just
separated<00:03:48.400> three<00:03:49.200> parts<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.730> now<00:03:51.940> you're

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
separated three parts and now you're

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.570 
separated three parts and now you're
just<00:03:52.360> going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.660> another<00:03:52.870> french<00:03:53.260> braid<00:03:53.620> so

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
just going to do another french braid so

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.190 
just going to do another french braid so
you're<00:03:54.790> just<00:03:54.880> going<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.150> put<00:03:55.300> under<00:03:55.510> pick<00:03:56.050> up

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
you're just going to put under pick up

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.199 
you're just going to put under pick up
and<00:03:56.980> put<00:03:57.220> under<00:03:59.820> you're<00:04:00.820> just<00:04:00.940> going<00:04:01.150> to

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
and put under you're just going to

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.509 
and put under you're just going to
continue<00:04:01.720> picking<00:04:02.200> up<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.739> will<00:04:03.400> be

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
continue picking up and this will be

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.040 
continue picking up and this will be
really<00:04:03.760> tight<00:04:04.030> because<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.390> will<00:04:04.510> look<00:04:04.540> be<00:04:04.840> hot

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
really tight because it will look be hot

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.360 
really tight because it will look be hot
because<00:04:05.170> since<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.680> braid<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.100> going<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.310> be

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
because since this braid is going to be

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.250 
because since this braid is going to be
smaller<00:04:06.670> it'll<00:04:07.660> be<00:04:07.780> harder<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:09.370> it's<00:04:09.519> just

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
smaller it'll be harder so it's just

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.880 
smaller it'll be harder so it's just
going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.350> be<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.590> lot<00:04:11.860> tighter<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:13.209> make<00:04:13.390> sure

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
going to be a lot tighter to make sure

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.350 
going to be a lot tighter to make sure
i'm<00:04:14.890> just<00:04:15.220> going<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.400> do<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:20.910> i'm<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:21.970> going

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
i'm just going to do that i'm just going

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.020 
i'm just going to do that i'm just going
to<00:04:22.630> continue<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.710> until<00:04:23.919> all<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.760> hairs

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
to continue that until all the hairs

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.750 
to continue that until all the hairs
just<00:04:25.650> stop<00:04:27.270> until<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.360> runs<00:04:28.510> out<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.580> then

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
just stop until it runs out and then

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.270 
just stop until it runs out and then
you're<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.330> going<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.660> continue<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.350> all

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
you're just going to continue that all

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.210 
you're just going to continue that all
the<00:04:34.030> way<00:04:34.150> around<00:04:34.360> just<00:04:34.950> pick<00:04:35.950> up<00:04:36.039> put<00:04:36.970> under

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
the way around just pick up put under

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.529 
the way around just pick up put under
pick<00:04:39.220> up<00:04:41.250> here<00:04:42.250> it's<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.669> little<00:04:42.700> tangled<00:04:43.180> in

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
pick up here it's a little tangled in

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:55.070 
pick up here it's a little tangled in
I'm<00:04:44.410> just<00:04:44.560> going<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.740> brush<00:04:44.860> that

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.149 

here's<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.129> last<00:04:56.280> point<00:04:57.710> you're<00:04:58.710> just<00:04:58.740> going

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
here's the last point you're just going

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.629 
here's the last point you're just going
to<00:04:59.250> come<00:04:59.939> on<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:04.250> then<00:05:05.250> just<00:05:05.280> do<00:05:05.520> it

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
to come on that and then just do it

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.480 
to come on that and then just do it
really<00:05:06.090> tight<00:05:06.569> braid

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.420 

and<00:05:12.060> you're<00:05:13.050> not<00:05:13.199> going<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:15.740> tight<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:17.069> then

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and you're not going to tight and then

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.320 
and you're not going to tight and then
you're<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:17.580> going<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:17.910> take<00:05:18.030> out<00:05:18.180> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
you're just going to take out the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.559 
you're just going to take out the
elastic<00:05:18.780> here<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.259> take<00:05:20.160> out<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:20.490> braid<00:05:20.819> and

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
elastic here and take out this braid and

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.779 
elastic here and take out this braid and
i'm<00:05:22.169> just<00:05:22.349> going<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.560> combine<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.490> then

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
i'm just going to combine it and then
