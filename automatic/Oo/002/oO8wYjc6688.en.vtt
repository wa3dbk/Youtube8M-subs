00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 with the outline and lighting 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 we seek to define the factions of the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.319
 face highlight the best attributes 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.540
 correct defects and you can even 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 tune the nose and lift the cheekbones and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 until diminishing the appearance if 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.750
 you want to know how to highlight even more 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.560
 beauty of your face in a very 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 easy 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.130
 stay watching 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.260
 at that time I already apply my base and 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 I have maquilla my eyes I will start 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.130
 illuminate with a concealer that is about 2 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.439
 or 3 shades lighter than the color of the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.450
 skin in a triangle shape so that 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.220
 the finish looks much more natural and does not 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.390
 are more than just the area of 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.489
 ojera 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.800
 important that when they use a concealer 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.260
 clearer do not be white only in 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030
 shades lighter than your skin color what 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.010
 extended to the cheekbone we are for 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.690
 that this is the basin that with the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.239
 lighter color what we do is attract 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 look at this and make it 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 stand out 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.329
 I will also illuminate the center of my 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.969
 front because I want to highlight all the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 area of the center of the face because what 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.530
 is more prominent naturally already 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 everything depends on your features 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.140
 and if you have a very large front look 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 illuminate very little or almost nothing and if 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
 you have a very small forehead everything 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.610
 otherwise I will also highlight the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.080
 partition 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 any new what I want to highlight 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 this wins between my face 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.690
 the center of the chin again 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.710
 surprise your features and you have a 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.869
 very great merit 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 we will try to highlight both if you have one 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.250
 smaller the flowers in addition to the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 eye illuminating sides because this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.000
 zone in my change is much darker and 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.000
 that's why I'm going to do it 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 in my eyes the center of my forehead the 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.970
 septum in my nose next to my mouth 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.860
 very well with a lawyer so that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.370
 taps to not drag the product 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.930
 that I have below and it is very very important 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.180
 that really fades 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.250
 because that just finished that so 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.250
 natural is the look of the cava 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.130
 Now I will start to seal everything 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.569
 that illuminates using a folio I have a lot 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 lighter than my skin's natural tone 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 because I want these areas to be 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.020
 keep illuminated and clear I use the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.880
 powder they use on all the team and faces 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.950
 obviously this nation obscures a 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.989
 little if you want to avoid this step 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.269
 You can use a translucent post that 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.010
 that's like any skin tone but 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.590
 personally I like to use more this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 method to keep comfortable what is clear and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.150
 the dark well defined 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 you find the outline you can use 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.469
 the concealer dark or one more cream or 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.129
 a browser but it's very important that 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.800
 be it mate or you can also use in 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.120
 this case 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.459
 in shop 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.970
 first you will start where you joined 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.010
 increase as of bone and from 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.290
 there life can grow from the combo 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.690
 what is the matrix if it is difficult for you? 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.430
 find where is this hole 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.069
 you can also help doing what 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 call the mouth of the fish and 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.890
 resplendent cheeks has gone up 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.900
 start with the internet also applies a 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.390
 little next to my forehead that well for 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 define a bit more my features have 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.750
 a look or a little bit more tan 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.069
 that will help my face look 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.069
 a little thinner and thinner 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.820
 to contour to the sides 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.930
 so that this looks much thinner 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.290
 it's really an excellent group 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 makes you win the super different also 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.099
 I'm going to contaminate a little rhode the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.099
 tip to make it much more 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.820
 finally they will start to contour 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.980
 from a ojani chin 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.420
 then to further define the face and the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.800
 part can also help you to 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.800
 decrease a little more the double chin 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.680
 reviewing outline under my cheekbones 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.080
 on the sides of my forehead on the sides 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.270
 and under the chin hi again here 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.729
 there is eating very well especially the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.509
 outline so you do not see a mark 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:37.000
 dirty and do not see everything naturalize as 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:39.550
 shadows that naturally to the house that 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.039
 is not laminar and I decided to blur with the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.830
 ring finger because it is the weakest finger 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.870
 that we have and besides that these are 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.110
 pretty small I had my bruce was very 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.110
 big 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.340
 finally I will teach all the 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.140
 crosses with the control using a 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.300
 body that if the right microphone 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.040
 Skin that I will do a 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.690
 little taps again for not 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.200
 drag any of the product we have 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.200
 of eye 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.960
 i 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.360
 as the powder you use is high 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.360
 coverage 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.630
 and all the outline because that of having 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.520
 covered a little dust and you want 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.150
 know it a little more so that it happens to me 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.150
 unnoticed 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.530
 I will also use the same eleven with 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.390
 a smaller skewer and I'm going to 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.460
 Contouring just below my 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.200
 lips this is going to create the appearance of 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.610
 we have several thicker ones and the same 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.320
 I'm going to do in the little hole that 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.740
 located just above the arch 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.740
 Cupid 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.990
 to finish I'll use a bit of 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.550
 smell by applying it from the cheeks and 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.550
 blurring him towards the coso 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.890
 to finish the look I'm going to use a 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.240
 pencil that from the color of my lips and 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.240
 I'm going to apply a little of the eyes 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.900
 and the final result of a look I hope 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.240
 make no difference and if they liked it 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.800
 this video seemed useful to me not 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.479
 I like the days subscribe to me 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.490
 channel so they know when a video 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.240
 new every week we see in the 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.240
 next video
