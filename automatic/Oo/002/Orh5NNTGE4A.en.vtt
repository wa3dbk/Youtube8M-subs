00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.420
 plug with the site and today as I promised 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 we will have a lesson because the word 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 see i 'm on my site and everything 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.500
 let's see how it all looks and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 so for example let's say you want to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 Forum as I now have principle 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.340
 you want for example there you take 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.090
 tab and that's like well that is there 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 write 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 here read the charter and stop and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 press or charter directly on the word charter 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.020
 and you are tired of passes on part of the case 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.040

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.310
