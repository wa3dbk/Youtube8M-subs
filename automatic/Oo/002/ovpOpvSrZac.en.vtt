people to help me with this but here is
the<00:00:18.210> original<00:00:18.960> down<00:00:19.619> test<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.340> devices

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the original down test on all devices

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.720 
the original down test on all devices
and<00:00:21.359> aleko<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> exact<00:00:22.439> same<00:00:22.680> time<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and aleko at the exact same time so

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.450 
and aleko at the exact same time so
there<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> goes<00:00:24.480> surprisingly<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.710> 3gs<00:00:26.220> was

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
there it goes surprisingly the 3gs was

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
there it goes surprisingly the 3gs was
first<00:00:26.820> followed<00:00:27.330> by<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> 3g<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> four

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
first followed by the 3g then the four

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
first followed by the 3g then the four
and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> 2g<00:00:29.910> there's<00:00:30.210> something<00:00:30.630> about

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and then the 2g there's something about

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
and then the 2g there's something about
iOS<00:00:31.320> 6<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> lower<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.340> actually<00:00:32.790> makes<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
iOS 6 and lower that actually makes the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.870 
iOS 6 and lower that actually makes the
shutdown<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.380> faster<00:00:34.980> than<00:00:35.100> iowa<00:00:35.489> 7

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
shutdown time a lot faster than iowa 7

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.299 
shutdown time a lot faster than iowa 7
although<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.690> devices<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.260> iowa<00:00:37.620> 7<00:00:37.950> shut<00:00:38.160> down

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
although all devices on iowa 7 shut down

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
although all devices on iowa 7 shut down
at<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> exact<00:00:39.149> same<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.809> which<00:00:40.110> makes<00:00:40.379> me

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
at the exact same time which makes me

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
at the exact same time which makes me
think<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.579> change<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
think what do they change and in a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.479 
think what do they change and in a
second<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.379> should<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.010> turning

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
second here they should all be turning

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
second here they should all be turning
off<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> exact<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.230> all

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
off at the exact same time now all

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.900 
off at the exact same time now all
performing<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> boot<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> tests<00:00:47.700> i<00:00:47.760> just

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
performing the boot of tests i just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.310 
performing the boot of tests i just
wanna<00:00:48.059> let<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.270> guys<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.870> important

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
wanna let you guys know it's important

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.010 
wanna let you guys know it's important
to<00:00:49.379> notice<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> 5s<00:00:51.239> under<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> 2g

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
to notice that from the 5s under the 2g

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
to notice that from the 5s under the 2g
there<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> massive<00:00:52.710> difference<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there is a massive difference in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.150 
there is a massive difference in
processing<00:00:54.180> power<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> ram<00:00:54.899> obviously<00:00:55.710> also

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
processing power and ram obviously also

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
processing power and ram obviously also
the<00:00:56.579> software<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> different<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.870> could

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the software is different so that could

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
the software is different so that could
majorly<00:00:58.500> affect<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.730> wasn't<00:01:00.210> too

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
majorly affect this now I wasn't too

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
majorly affect this now I wasn't too
surprised<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> 5s<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.800> course<00:01:02.010> came

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
surprised because the 5s of course came

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
surprised because the 5s of course came
in<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.670> followed<00:01:03.149> by<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> five<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.110> five

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
in first followed by the five and five

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
in first followed by the five and five
see<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.100> came<00:01:05.339> next<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.360> pretty

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
see what came next was actually pretty

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
see what came next was actually pretty
surprising<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> let<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> guys<00:01:07.860> know

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
surprising and just to let you guys know

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
surprising and just to let you guys know
all<00:01:08.310> these<00:01:08.939> devices<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.570> freshly<00:01:09.900> restored

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
all these devices are freshly restored

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
all these devices are freshly restored
non-jailbroken<00:01:11.119> completely<00:01:12.119> stock<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the
5c<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.439> 5<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:14.040> followed<00:01:14.369> by<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> 4s<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
5c and 5 was followed by the 4s and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.230 
5c and 5 was followed by the 4s and
surprisingly<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.500> 2g<00:01:17.220> came<00:01:17.670> before<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
surprisingly the 2g came before the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.920 
surprisingly the 2g came before the
iphone<00:01:18.600> 4<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> 3gs<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> iphone<00:01:21.540> 4

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
iphone 4 then the 3gs then the iphone 4

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.609 
iphone 4 then the 3gs then the iphone 4
and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> iphone<00:01:23.520> 3g<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.420> long<00:01:24.750> last<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and then the iphone 3g at long last that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.289 
and then the iphone 3g at long last that
was<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.189> surprising<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.119> me<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
was actually really surprising for me to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
was actually really surprising for me to
see<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.689> these<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.680> running<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
see because these are all running the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.969 
see because these are all running the
latest<00:01:29.460> firmware<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.720> 2g<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.350> obviously

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
latest firmware and the 2g is obviously

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
latest firmware and the 2g is obviously
not<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.430> powerful<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> four<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.110> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
not as powerful as the four it's just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
not as powerful as the four it's just
the<00:01:34.470> booting<00:01:34.799> sequence<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> works

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the booting sequence in the way it works

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.109 
the booting sequence in the way it works
probably<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.960> changed<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> iOS<00:01:37.950> 7<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
couple of tests I'm gonna load reddit

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
couple of tests I'm gonna load reddit

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
processing power and the new Wi-Fi

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
processing power and the new Wi-Fi
capabilities<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.920> amazing<00:01:50.460> web

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
capabilities it's an amazing web

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
capabilities it's an amazing web
browsing<00:01:50.939> device<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> goes<00:01:52.049> downhill

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
browsing device and it goes downhill

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.249 
browsing device and it goes downhill
from<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> 5c<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
from there to the 5c and so on just to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.020 
from there to the 5c and so on just to
confirm<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.979> applications<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.000> been

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
confirm all applications have been

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
confirm all applications have been
closed<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> multitasking<00:01:58.619> bar<00:01:58.829> where

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
closed in the multitasking bar where

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
closed in the multitasking bar where
applicable<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.299> we're<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> go

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
applicable and we're just going to go

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
applicable and we're just going to go
ahead<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.469> load<00:02:01.860> reddit<00:02:02.189> com<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.210> go

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ahead and load reddit com and here we go

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.929 
ahead and load reddit com and here we go
so<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> reddit<00:02:04.409> com<00:02:04.799> launched<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.790> all

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so this is reddit com launched on all

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
so this is reddit com launched on all
devices<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> same<00:02:06.689> time<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.619> 5s<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.310> king

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
devices at the same time the 5s is king

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
devices at the same time the 5s is king
in<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.879> test<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.360> well<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.840> others<00:02:10.110> then

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
in this test as well as all others then

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.920 
in this test as well as all others then
comes<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> five<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> 5c<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> 4s

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
comes the five then the 5c then the 4s

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.110 
comes the five then the 5c then the 4s
and<00:02:13.079> then<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> four<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.859> so<00:02:14.219> on<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.819> what<00:02:15.000> did

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and then the four and so on so what did

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.209 
and then the four and so on so what did
I<00:02:15.180> learn<00:02:15.359> doing<00:02:15.719> these<00:02:15.870> tests<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.439> learned<00:02:17.040> that

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
I learn doing these tests I learned that

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.979 
I learn doing these tests I learned that
the<00:02:17.430> amount<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.909> processing<00:02:18.120> power<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the amount of processing power is

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.630 
the amount of processing power is
greater<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.500> course<00:02:19.739> as<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> generation<00:02:20.459> goes

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
greater of course as a generation goes

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.270 
greater of course as a generation goes
on<00:02:20.849> but<00:02:21.359> it's<00:02:21.540> marginally<00:02:22.319> less<00:02:22.739> noticeable

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
on but it's marginally less noticeable

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.819 
on but it's marginally less noticeable
the<00:02:23.700> higher<00:02:23.909> you<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:25.109> you<00:02:25.349> have<00:02:25.469> a<00:02:25.500> five

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
the higher you go so if you have a five

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.800 
the higher you go so if you have a five
I<00:02:26.159> wouldn't<00:02:26.819> really<00:02:27.030> recommend<00:02:27.150> upgrading

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.629 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading
you<00:02:28.079> know<00:02:28.200> 5s<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.950> based<00:02:29.099> on<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.310> fact<00:02:29.549> that

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
you know 5s just based on the fact that

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.099 
you know 5s just based on the fact that
you<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:30.000> extra<00:02:30.420> little<00:02:30.689> bit<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.930> power

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
you want extra little bit of power

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.869 
you want extra little bit of power
because<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.650> has<00:02:31.889> an<00:02:32.040> amazing<00:02:32.579> amount<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
because it has an amazing amount of

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.459 
because it has an amazing amount of
power<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.629> if<00:02:33.930> you're<00:02:33.989> always

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
power as it is if you're always

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.959 
power as it is if you're always
upgrading<00:02:34.889> to<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> latest<00:02:35.219> and<00:02:35.700> greatest

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
upgrading to the latest and greatest

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.059 
upgrading to the latest and greatest
just<00:02:36.389> based<00:02:36.659> on<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.959> little<00:02:37.319> spike<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.859> power

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
just based on that little spike in power

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.709 
just based on that little spike in power
you<00:02:38.639> know<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.879> video<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.510> showed<00:02:39.689> you
