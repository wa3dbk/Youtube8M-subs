 accused since the beginning of

 investigations the accused deny the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 authorship of the alleged crime

 marixa fabiane lopes rodrigues 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 the forecast is that it will last two weeks and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 to talk more about it 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 we are receiving here in our 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.460
 studios the legal consultant of tv 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.869
 fairness of zero on very good late dates 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 be all right all right 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 Good afternoon look what a lot of talk that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.290
 much is asked how can there be a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.689
 homicide trial without 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.770
 identification of the corpse of the body as 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.930
 that this can be done 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.110
 theoretically this is possible yes 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.850
 in fact it is for someone to be 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
 convicted of a crime, it is necessary that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.930
 materiality of the crime or 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 evidence that this crime existed in the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.950
 case of homicide the materiality of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 crime occurs through the corpse 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 the code of criminal procedure however 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 he said that it is all these crimes that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.380
 leave traces 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.159
 they should be an exam called body of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.869
 crime 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.310
 only that body body examination of 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.710
 offense it can be done in two ways: 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.049
 or in a straightforward way when one has to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 example the body is made of analysis 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.159
 reasons that led to the death of 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.070
 victim or can be taken body 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.829
 of indirect crime, which is when 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 find the corpse is and there that exam him 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.020
 is done by taking as a basis 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.729
 of witnesses and other traces that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.280
 possibly have been left as 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.819
 for example the dress of jesus 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 yang of other fabrics such as skin nail 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.120
 hair and then with these conclusions 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 one has to the result that death 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.950
 actually happened now this is not 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.959
 I do not even know the body of the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.819
 victim of this or is not the first in the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.020
 truth is not we have even cases 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.540
 emblematic 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.700
 one of the cases we can mention was 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.150
 in relation to the brother ships actually 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.000
 in 1937 they were sentenced to more than 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.390
 25 years in prison for the death of a 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.040
 businessman at the time and what happened is 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.830
 that 15 years later 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 the alleged victim reappears and there 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.200
 concludes that there was indeed an error in the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.269
 judgment 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.010
 in this case including the brothers not 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.590
 came to confess to the practice of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.290
 killing by torture and such and 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.900
 even in a situation like this is the victim 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.340
 reappeared and then checked whether the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.350
 of judicial error 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 In Brazil there was also a situation in which 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.100
 that a former police officer was sentenced to 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.739
 of 17 years for the death of a teenager 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.390
 and the conviction was based on 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.549
 investigations that were found 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.280
 inside the former police officer's vehicle as 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.110
 for example a hair of the hair of the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 victim and that it was possible to take an exam 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.640
 of DNA and by means of this examination of DNA 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.070
 proved that it was the hair of the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 also another case in são paulo 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.100
 for example a judge has been convicted of 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.140
 more than 13 years in prison for the death of 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 wife who was missing and even 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.209
 today we did not take into account the remains 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.769
 her mortals then we had situations 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.079
 both of judicial error and of 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.160
 convictions even without the presence of the 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.150
 body of the victim 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.769
 good, and in cases like these it 's not for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.350
 example of prosecuting homicide without 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.510
 goal bodily presence with 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.540
 identification of the body what the jurors 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.910
 should consider everything should be fine 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.130
 clear in the plenary of the jury's court 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.560
 in fact when a judge he submits 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.590
 submits such a case to the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.720
 by the jury's court it does based on the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.730
 fact that at that time when he says 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.670
 Look, this should go to the popular jury. 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.470
 he does for society 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.630
 but at a time when the jurors they 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.609
 they lean is with all the collection 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.650
 evidence that they have in case they need 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 is really convinced if there has been 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.070
 not death 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.740
 they are free to play 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.870
 Normally, insys's defense insists on 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.150
 situations like that a name for the defendant 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.520
 is in doubt should prevail 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.610
 the presumption of innocence and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.870
 accusation in similar situations ends up 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.250
 is tapping to the point that it is possible 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 other evidence that 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.840
 there was the death of the victim even though 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.150
 the body because of the fact that crimes 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.160
 as homicide is also common to see or 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.960
 pass corpse concealment 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.669
 the process de0 thank you for your 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.020
 participation here again in the newspaper 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.020
 of justice that credencia
