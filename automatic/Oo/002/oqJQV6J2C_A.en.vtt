00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hello I'm VX toy cat and welcome back to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:03.379 
hello I'm VX toy cat and welcome back to
another<00:00:02.909> video

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
another video

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.880 
another video
even<00:00:03.840> though<00:00:03.929> minecraft<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> console<00:00:04.740> and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
even though minecraft the console and

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.499 
even though minecraft the console and
minecraft<00:00:05.160> for<00:00:05.490> PC<00:00:05.790> are<00:00:05.970> programmed<00:00:06.359> in

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
minecraft for PC are programmed in

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.390 
minecraft for PC are programmed in
entirely<00:00:06.960> separate<00:00:07.470> languages<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.980> lot<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
entirely separate languages a lot of the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
entirely separate languages a lot of the
way<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.849> game<00:00:09.059> logic<00:00:09.269> works<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.750> actually

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
way that in game logic works is actually

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
way that in game logic works is actually
identical<00:00:10.679> across<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.490> them<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:11.820> if

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
identical across the two of them so if

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.070 
identical across the two of them so if
you<00:00:11.940> think<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.150> stuff<00:00:12.450> like<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.809> way<00:00:12.929> they

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
you think about stuff like the way they

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720 
you think about stuff like the way they
render<00:00:13.320> distance<00:00:13.410> works<00:00:13.830> stuff<00:00:14.580> actually

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
render distance works stuff actually

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
render distance works stuff actually
loads<00:00:15.120> out<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> loads<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.049> chunks<00:00:16.470> that's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
loads out and loads in in chunks that's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.349 
loads out and loads in in chunks that's
sixteen<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.160> sixteen<00:00:17.220> areas<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.180> means

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sixteen by sixteen areas and it means

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.939 
sixteen by sixteen areas and it means
that<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> result<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that as a result of that a lot of the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
that as a result of that a lot of the
way<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> console<00:00:20.820> works<00:00:21.000> actually<00:00:21.240> has<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
way the console works actually has a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
way the console works actually has a
direct<00:00:22.020> comparison<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> PC<00:00:23.250> options<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
direct comparison in the PC options so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
direct comparison in the PC options so
it'd<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> fun<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> comparison<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
it'd be fun but for a comparison and to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.560 
it'd be fun but for a comparison and to
let<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.340> know<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> works<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
let you know you know how it works to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.550 
let you know you know how it works to
actually<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.080> through<00:00:28.230> each<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> these

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually go through each of these

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
actually go through each of these
options<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> lay<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> console

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
options and lay know what the console

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
options and lay know what the console
equivalent<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.779> runs<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.170> high

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
equivalent is if it runs pretty high

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.080 
equivalent is if it runs pretty high
that's<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> doesn't<00:00:32.669> run<00:00:32.820> pretty

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that's good if it doesn't run pretty

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.340 
that's good if it doesn't run pretty
high<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> PC<00:00:33.630> side<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> things<00:00:34.110> that's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
high on the PC side of things that's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.870 
high on the PC side of things that's
probably<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.890> too<00:00:35.130> great<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.730> probably

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
probably not too great and it's probably

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
probably not too great and it's probably
not<00:00:36.059> too<00:00:36.239> well<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.480> sized<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.290> one

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
not too well up sized so that's one

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
not too well up sized so that's one
we're<00:00:37.530> doing<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.890> today's<00:00:38.190> video<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.670> also

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
we're doing in today's video it's also

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
we're doing in today's video it's also
gonna<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> handy<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.170> how

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
gonna be a handy way of you to know how

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
gonna be a handy way of you to know how
you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.950> run<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.219> PC<00:00:41.520> version<00:00:41.790> again<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you can run your PC version again so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
you can run your PC version again so
there<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> runs<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> console<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there it runs like the console and I

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and yeah let's get straight into the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.139 
and yeah let's get straight into the
video<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.160> shall<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.579> let's<00:00:50.730> start<00:00:51.030> by

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
video then shall we so let's start by

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.189 
video then shall we so let's start by
explaining<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.660> making<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
explaining why I'm making this I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
explaining why I'm making this I'm
making<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.070> try<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> look<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
making this because I try to look up the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
making this because I try to look up the
render<00:00:54.090> distance<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> Xbox<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
render distance for the Xbox one and the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
render distance for the Xbox one and the
ps4<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.039> point<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> could<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.059> find<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
ps4 at one point and I could not find it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
ps4 at one point and I could not find it
anywhere<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.469> nowhere<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
anywhere there was just nowhere on the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.869 
anywhere there was just nowhere on the
internet<00:00:59.160> where<00:00:59.280> someone<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.640> told<00:00:59.789> me

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
internet where someone had told me

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
internet where someone had told me
exactly<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.020> really

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
exactly what it is and that was really

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.510 
exactly what it is and that was really
strange<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.559> me<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:01.890> minecraft<00:01:02.129> saw

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
strange to me because minecraft saw

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
strange to me because minecraft saw
solve<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.940> where<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.420> stuff<00:01:03.660> should

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
solve game where all this stuff should

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
solve game where all this stuff should
be<00:01:03.960> documented<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.949> reason<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
be documented but some reason the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.590 
be documented but some reason the
console<00:01:05.519> isn't<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.299> documented

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
console isn't quite as well documented

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
console isn't quite as well documented
as<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> PC<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.530> did<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> bunch<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> tests<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
as a PC so I did a bunch of tests to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.950 
as a PC so I did a bunch of tests to
determine<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.939> these<00:01:09.090> options<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> let's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
determine all these options and let's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
determine all these options and let's
starve<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> rent<00:01:10.470> distance<00:01:10.770> cuz<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
starve the rent distance cuz that's the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
starve the rent distance cuz that's the
one<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.700> most<00:01:11.970> concerned<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.140> was

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
one I was most concerned about and I was

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600 
one I was most concerned about and I was
really<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.770> impressed<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
really really impressed because on the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
really really impressed because on the
PC<00:01:14.970> trend<00:01:15.210> distance<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> wondering

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
PC trend distance if you wondering

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.390 
PC trend distance if you wondering
determines<00:01:16.409> how<00:01:16.530> many<00:01:16.590> chunks<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.100> front<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
determines how many chunks in front of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.740 
determines how many chunks in front of
you<00:01:17.490> behind<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> left<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.600> right

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you behind you to the left and the right

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.390 
you behind you to the left and the right
you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.380> any<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.650> time<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.130> runs<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can see any one time it runs so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
you can see any one time it runs so
anywhere<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:20.700> 2<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.330> 16<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.170> every<00:01:22.470> single

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
anywhere from 2 to 16 also every single

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
anywhere from 2 to 16 also every single
expanded<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> 32<00:01:23.250> recently<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> means

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
expanded to 32 recently so that means

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
expanded to 32 recently so that means
you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.869> anywhere<00:01:25.259> from<00:01:25.460> 32<00:01:26.460> blocks<00:01:26.580> any

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you can see anywhere from 32 blocks any

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
you can see anywhere from 32 blocks any
direction<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> edge<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
direction and then you get that edge you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.660 
direction and then you get that edge you
can<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> distance<00:01:29.400> over

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
can kind of see in the distance over

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.929 
can kind of see in the distance over
there

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
there

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
there
and<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.740> being

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and all the way up to you know being

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
and all the way up to you know being
able<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.970> over<00:01:33.210> 500<00:01:33.750> at

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
able to see but I think it's over 500 at

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
able to see but I think it's over 500 at
the<00:01:33.930> maximum<00:01:34.259> distance<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the maximum distance now which is a lot

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.950 
the maximum distance now which is a lot
of<00:01:35.850> blocks<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> direction<00:01:36.750> but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
of blocks in into a direction but

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.450 
of blocks in into a direction but
they're<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.590> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> ranges<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
they're there the two kind of ranges to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.620 
they're there the two kind of ranges to
chunks<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.600> really

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
chunks is if you have a really really

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.999 
chunks is if you have a really really
slow<00:01:39.930> piece<00:01:40.140> senior<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.590> trying<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
max performance and first two chunks if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
max performance and first two chunks if
you<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:42.960> insane<00:01:43.259> PC<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.130> want

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you have an insane PC and you just want

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.469 
you have an insane PC and you just want
to<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.520> everything<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.090> mean<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> has

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
to see everything I mean it has

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
to see everything I mean it has
performance<00:01:46.200> issues<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> things

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
performance issues on a lot of things

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
performance issues on a lot of things
but<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.430> still<00:01:47.549> something<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but it's still something you can do and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.820 
you can barely see this fog there if I
turn<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> left<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.380> can<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.680> there

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
turn to the left so you can see there

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.350 
turn to the left so you can see there
you<00:02:27.010> can<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.640> last<00:02:27.820> look<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.270> end

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
you can see that last look at the end

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.910 
you can see that last look at the end
there<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.840> about<00:02:29.230> see<00:02:29.380> at<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.800> edge

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
there I can just about see at the edge

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.130 
there I can just about see at the edge
there<00:02:30.300> let's<00:02:31.300> fly<00:02:31.480> over<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:32.020> show

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
there let's fly over to it and just show

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
there let's fly over to it and just show
you<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.260> how<00:02:32.650> far<00:02:32.980> away<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:33.730> yet

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
you just how far away this is so yet

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.400 
you just how far away this is so yet
like<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.330> mentioned<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.780> at<00:02:34.900> each<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.320> these

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
like I mentioned it at each of these

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.080 
like I mentioned it at each of these
represents<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.010> chunk<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.430> we're<00:02:36.820> gonna<00:02:36.910> go

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
represents one chunk and we're gonna go

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
represents one chunk and we're gonna go
past<00:02:37.300> 19<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.990> these<00:02:38.080> which<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.410> just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
past 19 of these which is just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
past 19 of these which is just
absolutely<00:02:38.800> crazy<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:40.300> can<00:02:40.480> see<00:02:40.690> this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
absolutely crazy that you can see this

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.350 
absolutely crazy that you can see this
far<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.040> one<00:02:42.310> downside<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:42.970> after

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
far so the one downside this is after

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.030 
far so the one downside this is after
about<00:02:43.510> 15<00:02:43.960> chunks<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.350> do<00:02:44.560> start<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.890> get<00:02:44.980> a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
about 15 chunks you do start to get a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.230 
about 15 chunks you do start to get a
bit<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.280> fog<00:02:45.460> which<00:02:45.640> means<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.940> can't<00:02:46.180> see

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
bit of fog which means you can't see

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.640 
bit of fog which means you can't see
stumps<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:46.900> stuff<00:02:47.110> unless<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.440> look<00:02:47.560> from

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
stumps some stuff unless you look from

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
stumps some stuff unless you look from
the<00:02:47.770> slide<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.760> fact<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.240> can

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the slide on but the fact that you can

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.910 
the slide on but the fact that you can
still<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.050> soft<00:02:50.290> stuff<00:02:50.440> from<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> distance

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
still see the soft stuff from a distance

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.670 
still see the soft stuff from a distance
is<00:02:51.070> still<00:02:51.490> absolutely<00:02:52.030> crazier<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:53.110> me<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
is still absolutely crazier to me and it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.320 
is still absolutely crazier to me and it
means<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:53.920> as<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.460> result<00:02:54.670> if<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.030> play<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
means that as a result if you play the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.060 
means that as a result if you play the
classic<00:02:55.720> wall-sized<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.350> 360<00:02:56.800> will<00:02:56.890> appears

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
classic wall-sized the 360 will appears

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.470 
classic wall-sized the 360 will appears
free<00:02:57.220> world<00:02:57.400> size<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.940> can<00:02:58.060> actually<00:02:58.210> see

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
free world size you can actually see

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.930 
free world size you can actually see
most<00:02:58.960> of<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> way<00:02:59.470> across<00:02:59.740> the<00:03:00.370> world<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.760> each

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
most of the way across the world in each

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
most of the way across the world in each
direction<00:03:01.180> from<00:03:01.870> standing<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.350> center

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
direction from standing in the center

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.930 
direction from standing in the center
which<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.250> really<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.460> cool<00:03:03.730> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
which is really really really cool so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.210 
which is really really really cool so
yeah<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.900> Ren<00:03:05.050> distance<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.470> 18<00:03:05.800> chunks<00:03:06.100> this

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
yeah the Ren distance is 18 chunks this

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.160 
yeah the Ren distance is 18 chunks this
is<00:03:06.370> very<00:03:06.730> very<00:03:06.970> high<00:03:07.210> compares<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.660> PC<00:03:07.990> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
is very very high compares the PC and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.290 
is very very high compares the PC and
even<00:03:09.130> with<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.520> way<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> fog<00:03:09.850> works<00:03:10.060> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
even with the way the fog works so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.700 
even with the way the fog works so
pretty<00:03:10.480> cool<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.380> something<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
pretty cool so I'm just something to

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.060 
pretty cool so I'm just something to
bear<00:03:11.830> in<00:03:11.950> mind<00:03:11.980> there<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.700> fog<00:03:13.000> but<00:03:13.660> still<00:03:14.200> 1818

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
bear in mind there is fog but still 1818

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.380 
bear in mind there is fog but still 1818
chunks<00:03:15.400> while<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> look<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.030> corner<00:03:16.240> just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
chunks while you look in the corner just

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.820 
chunks while you look in the corner just
going<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> show<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.020> one<00:03:17.170> more<00:03:17.200> time<00:03:17.290> if

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
going to show you that one more time if

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.230 
going to show you that one more time if
you<00:03:17.890> look<00:03:18.040> over<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.460> can<00:03:18.760> see<00:03:18.790> there's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
you look over there you can see there's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.060 
you look over there you can see there's
no<00:03:19.450> house<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.900> when<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.020> turn<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.530> right<00:03:20.800> if

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
no house but when I turn to the right if

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.680 
no house but when I turn to the right if
you<00:03:21.430> stare<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.760> same<00:03:21.940> point<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.270> there's<00:03:22.630> a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you stare that same point and there's a

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.300 
you stare that same point and there's a
house<00:03:22.840> on<00:03:22.990> for<00:03:23.140> some<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.380> yeah<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:23.830> something

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
house on for some so yeah just something

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.250 
house on for some so yeah just something
interesting<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:25.480> 18<00:03:26.110> Ren

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
interesting but it's that 18 Ren

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.960 
interesting but it's that 18 Ren
distance<00:03:26.530> chunk<00:03:26.740> pretty<00:03:26.980> impressive<00:03:27.220> moving

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
distance chunk pretty impressive moving

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.970 
distance chunk pretty impressive moving
on<00:03:28.060> from<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.240> we<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.900> resolution<00:03:29.770> so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
on from that we have the resolution so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.350 
on from that we have the resolution so
the<00:03:30.070> resolution<00:03:30.460> on<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.580> PC<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.030> actually

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
the resolution on the PC is actually

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.260 
the resolution on the PC is actually
customizable<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> think<00:03:33.090> 95%<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.180> people

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
customizable but I think 95% of people

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.880 
customizable but I think 95% of people
run<00:03:34.570> at<00:03:34.660> 1080p<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:35.380> that's<00:03:35.530> what<00:03:35.680> most

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
run at 1080p because that's what most

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.650 
run at 1080p because that's what most
monitors<00:03:36.070> run<00:03:36.340> out<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.600> know

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
monitors run out and that you know

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.270 
monitors run out and that you know
that's<00:03:37.990> kind<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.560> average<00:03:38.680> size<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
that's kind of just the average size and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.860 
that's kind of just the average size and
only<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.910> Xbox<00:03:40.180> fixing<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.540> pay<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.720> free

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
only the Xbox fixing that pay is free

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.720 
only the Xbox fixing that pay is free
and<00:03:41.050> Porsche<00:03:41.290> Li<00:03:41.350> they<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.830> run<00:03:41.950> at<00:03:42.070> 720p

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
a thousand fps I mean Myron's something

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.210 
a thousand fps I mean Myron's something
like<00:04:03.820> 200<00:04:04.750> or<00:04:04.810> max<00:04:04.990> settings<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.410> like<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.800> you

like 200 or max settings but like it you

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.090 
like 200 or max settings but like it you
might<00:04:06.520> be<00:04:06.580> like<00:04:06.790> odd<00:04:06.970> 6000<00:04:07.930> fps<00:04:08.290> why<00:04:08.500> why<00:04:08.890> is<00:04:08.950> it

only<00:04:09.190> 60<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.760> console<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.390> reason<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
only 60 on the console so the reason the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.870 
only 60 on the console so the reason the
FPS<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.590> capped<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:11.950> 60<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.310> consoles<00:04:12.760> is

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
FPS is capped is 60 on the consoles is

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.850 
FPS is capped is 60 on the consoles is
because<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.750> fact<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.560> know<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
because of the fact that you know the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.500 
because of the fact that you know the
consoles<00:04:15.220> only<00:04:15.400> put<00:04:15.550> out<00:04:15.640> 60<00:04:15.970> because<00:04:16.330> only

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
consoles only put out 60 because only

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.860 
consoles only put out 60 because only
like<00:04:17.220> 99.9%<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.640> people<00:04:18.730> only<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.330> 60<00:04:19.690> Hertz

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
like 99.9% of people only have 60 Hertz

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.570 
like 99.9% of people only have 60 Hertz
monitors<00:04:20.350> so<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.859> know<00:04:20.950> that's<00:04:21.070> kind<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.340> fine

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580

interesting<00:04:23.410> about<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.770> because<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.400> has

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
interesting about it is because it has

the<00:05:08.150> floor<00:05:08.390> it'll<00:05:08.690> actually<00:05:08.750> spin<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.320> become

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the floor it'll actually spin and become

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.470 
the floor it'll actually spin and become
a<00:05:09.530> 3d<00:05:09.860> item<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.280> two<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.820> can<00:05:11.030> see<00:05:11.060> through

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
a 3d item and two you can see through

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.510 
a 3d item and two you can see through
leaves<00:05:11.750> if<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.050> turn<00:05:12.290> on<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.440> fast<00:05:12.890> on<00:05:13.070> PC<00:05:13.400> you

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
leaves if you turn on a fast on PC you

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.430 
leaves if you turn on a fast on PC you
can't<00:05:13.760> see<00:05:13.880> free<00:05:14.030> leaves<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.480> yeah<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.410> is

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
can't see free leaves so yeah that is

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.980 
can't see free leaves so yeah that is
the<00:05:15.890> major<00:05:16.550> specs<00:05:16.970> from<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> PC<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.660> kind<00:05:17.960> of

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
the major specs from the PC I kind of

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.750 
the major specs from the PC I kind of
covered<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.770> rest<00:05:18.980> of<00:05:19.130> them<00:05:19.250> are<00:05:19.400> mostly

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
covered the rest of them are mostly

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.340 
covered the rest of them are mostly
talked<00:05:19.940> about<00:05:20.180> stuff<00:05:20.540> like<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.780> particle

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
talked about stuff like a particle

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.980 
talked about stuff like a particle
effects<00:05:21.530> stuff<00:05:21.770> like<00:05:22.570> for<00:05:23.570> instance<00:05:23.810> if<00:05:23.930> you

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
effects stuff like for instance if you

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.300 
effects stuff like for instance if you
guys<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.260> settings<00:05:24.560> are<00:05:24.710> here<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:24.980> can<00:05:25.130> see

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
guys the settings are here you can see

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.100 
guys the settings are here you can see
view<00:05:25.910> bobbing<00:05:26.180> that's<00:05:26.360> total<00:05:26.720> bull<00:05:26.870> if<00:05:27.050> you

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
view bobbing that's total bull if you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.690 
view bobbing that's total bull if you
look<00:05:27.260> at<00:05:27.380> all<00:05:27.470> this<00:05:27.590> stuff<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.919> actually<00:05:28.340> can

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
look at all this stuff it actually can

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.030 
look at all this stuff it actually can
be<00:05:28.730> toggled<00:05:28.970> just<00:05:29.570> over<00:05:29.780> here<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.140> um<00:05:30.380> what

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
be toggled just over here so um what

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.440 
be toggled just over here so um what
what<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> kind<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.729> you<00:05:32.120> kind<00:05:32.330> of

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
what is the kind of you kind of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.510 
what is the kind of you kind of
conclusion<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.320> raise<00:05:33.500> from<00:05:33.590> this<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:33.950> besides

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
conclusion to raise from this so besides

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.540 
conclusion to raise from this so besides
the<00:05:34.669> fov<00:05:35.180> which<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.510> stuck<00:05:35.870> at<00:05:35.990> 70<00:05:36.470> the<00:05:36.650> console

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
the fov which is stuck at 70 the console

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.150 
the fov which is stuck at 70 the console
runs<00:05:37.820> almost<00:05:38.450> near<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.020> max<00:05:39.320> of<00:05:39.530> what<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.710> PC

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
runs almost near the max of what a PC

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.700 
runs almost near the max of what a PC
can<00:05:40.370> do<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:40.760> this<00:05:41.090> is<00:05:41.270> well<00:05:41.570> being<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:42.050> very<00:05:42.410> low

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
can do and this is well being a very low

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.620 
can do and this is well being a very low
cost<00:05:42.860> concern<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.430> me<00:05:43.580> this<00:05:44.000> does<00:05:44.240> seem<00:05:44.450> like

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
cost concern to me this does seem like

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.420 
cost concern to me this does seem like
the<00:05:44.780> console<00:05:45.110> version<00:05:45.410> is<00:05:45.530> impressively

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
the console version is impressively

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.100 
the console version is impressively
optimized<00:05:46.970> like<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.300> might<00:05:47.450> sometimes<00:05:47.690> think

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
optimized like you might sometimes think

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.740 
optimized like you might sometimes think
like<00:05:48.290> ah<00:05:48.500> although<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.669> 4j<00:05:50.030> guys<00:05:50.210> have<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.600> do

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
like ah although the 4j guys have to do

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.330 
like ah although the 4j guys have to do
is<00:05:50.900> make<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.350> console<00:05:51.710> things<00:05:51.919> on<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.160> cutter

make the PC things on the console but in

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
the game to run at these impressive

take a serious amount optimization and I
was<00:06:01.790> genuinely<00:06:02.479> impressed<00:06:02.810> by<00:06:02.990> just<00:06:03.260> how<00:06:03.380> well

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530

let's<00:06:03.650> get<00:06:03.740> run<00:06:03.890> if<00:06:04.040> you<00:06:04.130> bought<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.490> PC<00:06:05.060> for<00:06:05.210> the

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
let's get run if you bought a PC for the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.780 
let's get run if you bought a PC for the
same<00:06:05.540> price<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:05.840> bought<00:06:06.290> um<00:06:06.640> you<00:06:07.640> know<00:06:07.760> a

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
same price you bought um you know a

same price you bought um you know a
console<00:06:08.450> app<00:06:08.540> and<00:06:08.720> unless<00:06:09.470> you<00:06:09.590> like<00:06:09.710> you've

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
console app and unless you like you've

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.200 
console app and unless you like you've
really<00:06:10.130> specifically<00:06:10.610> made<00:06:10.790> it<00:06:10.880> try<00:06:11.030> to<00:06:11.090> play

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
really specifically made it try to play

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
Minecraft it's not going to get the same

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680 
Minecraft it's not going to get the same
performance<00:06:12.710> and<00:06:13.280> I'd<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:14.120> me<00:06:14.240> that<00:06:14.450> something

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
performance and I'd to me that something

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.300 
performance and I'd to me that something
are<00:06:14.930> kind<00:06:15.140> of<00:06:15.200> shocking<00:06:15.530> so<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.040> kind<00:06:16.220> of

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
are kind of shocking so the kind of

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.070 
are kind of shocking so the kind of
conclusion<00:06:16.700> here<00:06:16.880> is<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.390> consoles<00:06:17.870> run

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
conclusion here is the consoles run

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.500 
conclusion here is the consoles run
surprisingly<00:06:18.590> well<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.130> last<00:06:19.460> gen<00:06:19.729> given

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
surprisingly well the last gen given

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.180 
surprisingly well the last gen given
that<00:06:20.660> they're<00:06:20.780> 10<00:06:21.020> years<00:06:21.050> old<00:06:21.350> run<00:06:21.890> the<00:06:22.010> game

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
that they're 10 years old run the game

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.280 
that they're 10 years old run the game
well<00:06:22.760> better<00:06:23.000> than<00:06:23.120> anything<00:06:23.600> from<00:06:23.930> that<00:06:24.050> era

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
well better than anything from that era

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.440 
well better than anything from that era
ever<00:06:24.560> could<00:06:24.860> and<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:25.520> next<00:06:25.760> gen<00:06:25.880> consoles<00:06:26.270> are

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
ever could and the next gen consoles are

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.390 
ever could and the next gen consoles are
very<00:06:26.750> very<00:06:27.020> like<00:06:27.290> given<00:06:27.890> that<00:06:27.979> their<00:06:28.100> value

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
very very like given that their value

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.920 
very very like given that their value
efficient<00:06:28.760> kind<00:06:28.910> of<00:06:28.970> consoles<00:06:29.360> they<00:06:29.660> run<00:06:29.840> the

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
efficient kind of consoles they run the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.469 
efficient kind of consoles they run the
game<00:06:30.140> like<00:06:30.560> a<00:06:30.740> very<00:06:31.130> high-end<00:06:31.550> PC<00:06:31.970> I<00:06:32.000> mean<00:06:32.300> the

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
game like a very high-end PC I mean the

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.330 
game like a very high-end PC I mean the
only<00:06:32.720> thing<00:06:32.840> missing<00:06:33.350> is<00:06:33.470> a<00:06:33.500> little<00:06:33.680> bit<00:06:34.040> more

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
only thing missing is a little bit more

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.909 
only thing missing is a little bit more
render<00:06:35.060> distance<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:35.539> maybe<00:06:36.200> a<00:06:36.349> field<00:06:36.740> of<00:06:36.830> the

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
render distance and maybe a field of the

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.170 
render distance and maybe a field of the
option<00:06:37.220> but<00:06:37.400> there's<00:06:37.550> reasons<00:06:37.940> why<00:06:38.000> they

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
option but there's reasons why they

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.880 
option but there's reasons why they
won't<00:06:38.330> do<00:06:38.419> that<00:06:38.570> but<00:06:38.930> they're<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.500> only<00:06:39.680> two

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
won't do that but they're the only two

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.080 
won't do that but they're the only two
graphics<00:06:40.250> options<00:06:40.520> you're<00:06:40.610> missing<00:06:40.880> and

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
graphics options you're missing and

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.730 
graphics options you're missing and
and<00:06:41.270> then<00:06:41.389> that's<00:06:41.630> not<00:06:41.720> much<00:06:42.230> performance

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
and then that's not much performance

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.159 
and then that's not much performance
missing<00:06:43.130> so<00:06:43.340> yeah<00:06:44.000> the<00:06:44.120> fact<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:44.480> you<00:06:44.930> can

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
missing so yeah the fact that you can

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.260 
missing so yeah the fact that you can
basically<00:06:45.380> have<00:06:45.830> a<00:06:45.980> maxed<00:06:46.520> out<00:06:46.610> settings<00:06:46.880> for

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
basically have a maxed out settings for

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.360 
basically have a maxed out settings for
a<00:06:47.389> lot<00:06:47.720> of<00:06:47.750> new<00:06:47.960> gen<00:06:48.139> console<00:06:48.530> or<00:06:48.740> you<00:06:49.010> can<00:06:49.190> have

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
a lot of new gen console or you can have

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.340 
a lot of new gen console or you can have
a<00:06:49.520> loss<00:06:49.760> on<00:06:49.940> console<00:06:50.270> which<00:06:50.360> cost<00:06:50.630> you<00:06:50.870> very

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
a loss on console which cost you very

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.350 
a loss on console which cost you very
close<00:06:51.710> to<00:06:51.740> nothing<00:06:52.040> and<00:06:52.340> you<00:06:52.729> can<00:06:52.760> get<00:06:53.090> a<00:06:53.120> game

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
close to nothing and you can get a game

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.300 
close to nothing and you can get a game
which<00:06:53.540> runs<00:06:53.810> very<00:06:54.139> comfortably<00:06:54.560> is<00:06:54.770> actually

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
which runs very comfortably is actually

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.439 
which runs very comfortably is actually
pretty<00:06:55.490> impressive<00:06:55.729> so<00:06:55.940> that's<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.210> kind<00:06:56.360> of

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
pretty impressive so that's the kind of

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.000 
pretty impressive so that's the kind of
point<00:06:56.660> I<00:06:56.780> want<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:56.960> get<00:06:57.080> across<00:06:57.290> here<00:06:57.560> I<00:06:57.710> hope
