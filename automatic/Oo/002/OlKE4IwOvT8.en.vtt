00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello and welcome to sap 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 I'm still a gaming video for you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.349
 sony xperia z3 for you and that's why 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.519
 let's go today we want to go 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 look how it is in the games 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.260
 Temple at two depp trigger 2 and modern 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 combat five so suggests that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.230
 Of course I have it new, of course 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 we won no high 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.769
 running apps and as soon as I'm with one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 I'm gonna finish it, too 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.949
 close again before I make a new one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 starts the games are natural 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 all not pre-installed 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.080
 you can but in the place gate 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.270
 either download for free or 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 you also have to have modern combat five 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.430
 to buy 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:43.500
 But now I wish you much fun 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:45.809
 Let's go Let's start 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 So, as always, do not templ at two 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 necessarily the most elaborate I play 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.559
 take it again and again quite happy 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 as I said there are still 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
 smartphones also with this game 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.340
 I expect problems with the z3 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.440
 but you do not see us going in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.480
 Settings under visual quality and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 of course, that's up to that very high 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 So we really have the full one here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 Hardware can then start to outreach 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.290
 Let's look at it the same already the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 Everything is going really well here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 nice liquid what also stands out 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 Of course, game looks great on the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.520
 52 inches full hd display yes that could 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.220
 But you do not expect otherwise 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.570
 yes I think to temper 2 there is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.189
 then not too much 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 say you see here running all very 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.119
 beautiful liquid no leaks or 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 There are always times like that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 happy with these fast movements 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 here but there has the sony xperia time 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.259
 three really no problem like 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.320
 actually all other smartphones with 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.970
 the qualcomm snapdragon 801 also now 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 Then we wait again very shortly to 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.520
 we have something to do with him since then 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.439
 actually mentioned that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.409
 viewing angle stability on the Sony xperia 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.180
 z3 is good but not perfect but here 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 In any case, the whole thing looks pretty good 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 that's it from the two tempera I think 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.310
 we have to get here much more 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.670
 do not start anymore it really works 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
 very smooth and really fun 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 and on we go now with the trigger 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.640
 Although a much more complex that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 game that also likes to make problems 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.479
 but again was told again the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 of course, onyx third should also be 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.850
 have no problems with this game 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.040
 you see the whole life 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.230
 how fast we authenticate ourselves and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.940
 there was a short time here with him 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.650
 loading screen but I think so too 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.510
 always very exciting to see how fast 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.100
 the games are then loaded as possible 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.950
 that is always an important one 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.380
 points yes we see it this same 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.270
 intro sequence here everything looks completely 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.280
 Nice on the display of the sony 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.590
 xperia z3 as I said it is really 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.320
 a decent display not the best 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.060
 but a very good display before we 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.040
 Let's start now 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
 For the first time we look around for a moment and then 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 Let's go under again 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.290
 options include performance and setting 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.820
 the whole thing up that was not 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.560
 automatically set to high but 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.250
 on medium if I'm right in 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.500
 have memory 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.180
 So you have to change first 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.210
 before you start to spin 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.730
 But we will do that as well now we go 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.950
 Here's just the graphics I can 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 telling you is as good as any 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.210
 another smartphone with the qualcomm 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.950
 So Snapdragon 801 really does 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.480
 a very high level and you 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 you will see the whole thing right away 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.130
 Running relatively smoothly we pick here 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.230
 now the water and go 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.110
 then back to our buddy back 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.760
 unfortunately unfortunately was transformed 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.100
 or just one of them 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.540
 Zombie is slaughtered now 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 we kill the zombie and that is 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.840
 always a scene where it likes 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.480
 But he gives he has seen that 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.090
 was actually relatively fluid when yes 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.550
 Now again this short one 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.110
 inter-sequence here, of course, without 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.820
 problems a few words to the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.860
 loudspeakers, by the way, they are at 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.610
 Sony Xperia Z3 here on the front 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.650
 appropriate 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.450
 I criticize him whenever 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.660
 speakers on the back are or 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.140
 just below the micro usb connection to 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.850
 example 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.560
 That's why I have to be such an expert here 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.780
 three praise that on the front 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.690
 are just because you have a lot 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.980
 has better sound and in that we 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.110
 also have stereo speakers 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.040
 makes this really a lot of gambling 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.110
 a lot of fun 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.820
 I know I had the collector age 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.330
 cut out here and after all 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.640
 dilute 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.750
 But be sure you are worried here 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.180
 really a lot of fun 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.680
 that was the trigger 2 and last but not least 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.500
 Let's have a look here too 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.239
 of course, modern combat 5 at a very 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.220
 we want a complicated game 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.359
 Of course, look like the sony 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.949
 xperia z3 performs like this 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.710
 Again, we are waiting for the 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.629
 Charging time is five in modern combat 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.389
 According to experience a little longer than the 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:32.479
 yes other play but we also 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.819
 much more extensive story just 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.979
 Also, or the game itself is just 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.419
 pretty elaborate on the speakers 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.979
 I have always spoken it is 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.210
 yes , always very interesting 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.590
 About the heat development 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 heat development to say 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.939
 Here, too, you really need yourself 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.270
 not to worry about his xperia 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:52.310
 For example, he was relatively tall 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.439
 Meanwhile we have the z 3 yes 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.020
 and even if you do that once 15 to 30 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.509
 minutes or even longer it will be 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.979
 maybe a bit warmer but really 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.810
 not worrisome that it 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.139
 somehow disturbing in any way 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.539
 would 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.210
 now we play 15 times and you will see 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.250
 it also runs very smoothly and it sees 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.990
 also really good i can only 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.539
 Let's say how you expect it 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.240
 but may be modern 5 is always such a 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.979
 Surprise box just at the beginning gave 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.889
 there are always some problems with it 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.779
 The game was less so essential 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.060
 the smartphones lay just more 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.050
 also because the game is easy 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.210
 was pretty buggy 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.060
 I would always like that too 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.830
 iphone 6 or 6 plus on where this sky 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.169
 in venice you also come now 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.770
 totally flickered and a single back 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.029
 that was nice but yes that should be us 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.550
 do not expect it here 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.330
 now we help the good one here, too 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.060
 still up 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.620
 I had some problems here about that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.870
 to wipe the display but that we now 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.300
 also done and then we are now 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.069
 even in the beautiful little and he 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.020
 The sky looks really good 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.939
 Again, you can see in my opinion 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.159
 again very good and how great the 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.870
 Graphics here is really that can be 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.750
 for such a smartphone really let see 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.159
 but as I said yes that can also 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.580
 all other smartphones with the 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.930
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 he should not 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.849
 be a big surprise 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.250
 You can see that everything is working here as well 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.169
 Of course, you can drink very well 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.210
 always in the back of the head we keep 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.729
 also have no unpleasant unpleasant 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.199
 framerate slumps and so on that 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.319
 makes everything really very much fun 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.330
 on the sony xperia z3 what 's up now 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.800
 Last but not least, I think we are 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.650
 have seen it quite well as actually 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.139
 almost every other smartphone with 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.660
 Of course, Snapdragon 801 also has one 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.310
 the xperia z3 in gaming and 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.960
 play no problems can be 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.210
 really let the whole thing go 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.770
 really fun he people that's it 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.630
 video I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.250
 sorry that it took so long 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.440
 but it is now easy to 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.000
 many new smartphones but as I said 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.910
 I know some have been waiting 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.320
 and yes , it finally came in at last 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.210
 this one of his many thanks for watching 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.210
 and see you next time
