00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
whoo now don't try that at home that is

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.220 
whoo now don't try that at home that is
relatively<00:00:07.740> dangerous<00:00:11.540> well<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> reason<00:00:13.019> why

chained<00:00:27.830> garage<00:00:28.830> door<00:00:29.099> opener<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:30.050> will

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
chained garage door opener I will

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
chained garage door opener I will
probably<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> glider<00:00:32.219> down<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> let

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
probably get that glider down and let

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.209 
probably get that glider down and let
you<00:00:33.270> take<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> top<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you take a look at the top not at the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.360 
you take a look at the top not at the
moment<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.000> lazy<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:38.040> Steve<00:00:38.280> we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
moment because I'm lazy and Steve we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770 
moment because I'm lazy and Steve we
have<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> string<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> believe<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
have a string here I believe that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
have a string here I believe that
actually<00:00:40.040> changes<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> length<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
actually changes the length this I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.500 
actually changes the length this I
believe<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> chain<00:00:42.840> release<00:00:44.059> I'm<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.360> gonna

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
believe is a chain release I'm not gonna

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760 
believe is a chain release I'm not gonna
public<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> release

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
public because I don't want to release

anything<00:00:47.180> well<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.600> hardwired<00:00:49.250> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
anything well it's not hardwired it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.600 
anything well it's not hardwired it's
just<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.170> extension<00:00:52.710> cord<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> note

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just on an extension cord going to note

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.420 
just on an extension cord going to note
with<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.780> entire<00:00:54.930> garage<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.949> her

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
with it there the entire garage is her

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.660 
with it there the entire garage is her
is<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:57.059> hardwired<00:00:57.480> circuit<00:00:58.370> best<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> my

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is one hardwired circuit best of my

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
is one hardwired circuit best of my
knowledge<00:00:59.899> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> bottom<00:01:01.559> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
knowledge you can see on the bottom that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
knowledge you can see on the bottom that
is<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.290> sensitivity<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
is actually the sensitivity to the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.490 
is actually the sensitivity to the
safety<00:01:04.680> sensitivity<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.350> if

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
safety sensitivity so like if

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.520 
safety sensitivity so like if
something's<00:01:08.189> underneath<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> door<00:01:09.260> how<00:01:10.260> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
something's underneath the door how much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
something's underneath the door how much
it<00:01:10.770> has<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.340> pressured<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.330> much

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it has to like be pressured how much

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
it has to like be pressured how much
pressure<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> object<00:01:13.830> before

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
pressure has to be on that object before

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.469 
pressure has to be on that object before
it<00:01:14.580> goes<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.780> can't<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:20.479> well

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it goes up and then I can't see well

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
it goes up and then I can't see well
there's<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.810> antenna<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> radio

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there's an antenna for the radio

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.880 
there's an antenna for the radio
operation<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.850> can't<00:01:24.600> read<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.320> maybe<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
operation I can't read those maybe the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.969 
operation I can't read those maybe the
camera<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.520> read<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.880> better<00:01:27.090> than<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.390> can't

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
camera can read them better than I can't

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.749 
camera can read them better than I can't
be<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.040> focus

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
be in focus

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.859 
be in focus
oh<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> open<00:01:32.030> math<00:01:33.030> says<00:01:33.270> closed

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
oh that's the open math says closed

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.560 
oh that's the open math says closed
I<00:01:33.960> believe<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.090> indifferent

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I believe that is the indifferent

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
I believe that is the indifferent

garage door or adjusting the speed on
the<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.700> see<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.729> terms<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.630> are

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the back you can see the terms that are

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
the back you can see the terms that are
routed<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> switch<00:01:49.040> right<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
routed to a switch right here it is the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.530 
routed to a switch right here it is the
original<00:01:51.600> garage<00:01:52.560> door<00:01:52.829> control<00:01:53.310> switch<00:01:53.610> I've

original garage door control switch I've
never<00:01:54.780> been<00:01:54.990> replaced<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.920> original<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.369> have

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
never been replaced the original we have

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.480 
never been replaced the original we have
had<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> doors<00:01:57.000> worked<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.950> uh<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
had the doors worked on because uh I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.440 
had the doors worked on because uh I
can't<00:02:00.240> recall<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:03.210> decided

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
can't recall which one it was we decided

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
can't recall which one it was we decided
it<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> door<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it was with one of the door one of the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.540 
it was with one of the door one of the
sides<00:02:05.070> ended<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.360> breaking<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.960> us

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.030 

because<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.860> metal<00:02:11.860> bent<00:02:13.020> random<00:02:14.020> well<00:02:14.800> yeah

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
because the metal bent random well yeah

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.980 
because the metal bent random well yeah
there<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> go

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
there you go

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.840 
there you go
thrust<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.170> bottom<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:18.310> where<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> water

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
thrust the bottom that's where the water

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.290 
thrust the bottom that's where the water
would<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.990> whatever<00:02:20.230> reason<00:02:20.800> we

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
would be and for whatever reason we

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.880 
would be and for whatever reason we
actually<00:02:22.300> found<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.600> cantaloupe<00:02:23.230> smashed

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
actually found this cantaloupe smashed

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.560 
actually found this cantaloupe smashed
on<00:02:24.160> our<00:02:24.280> tree<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:25.090> all<00:02:25.720> places<00:02:26.100> yesterday

that's<00:02:28.570> actually<00:02:29.200> kind<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.500> disgusting<00:02:30.720> no<00:02:31.720> no

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that's actually kind of disgusting no no

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.780 
that's actually kind of disgusting no no
no<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.740> we<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:33.040> figure<00:02:33.160> out<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.520> switch

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
no now we can figure out with the switch

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.620 
no now we can figure out with the switch
nuns

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.970 

well<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.810> switch<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> secondary

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
well the switch just is the secondary

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.900 
well the switch just is the secondary
control<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.670> light<00:02:39.910> at<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.630> back<00:02:40.750> here

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
control for that light at the back here

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.740 
control for that light at the back here
turn<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.030> back<00:02:43.240> on

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
turn that back on

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:58.640 
turn that back on
I<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:44.530> see<00:02:47.220> sure<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.340> miss<00:02:48.610> Eton<00:02:48.850> operation

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.560 

see<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.010> pressure

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.750 

Jane<00:03:05.570> isn't<00:03:05.750> tight<00:03:08.380> could<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.470> tighter<00:03:09.770> but

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:25.020 

you'll<00:03:13.760> see<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.030> move<00:03:14.360> as<00:03:14.480> soon<00:03:14.600> as<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.810> do<00:03:14.870> this

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.470 

want<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> put<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.390> down

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.699 

that<00:03:34.480> isn't<00:03:34.629> really<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.019> safest<00:03:35.379> thing<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.560> be

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
that isn't really the safest thing to be

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.839 
that isn't really the safest thing to be
doing<00:03:36.209> starting<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.360> stopping<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.670> can

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
doing starting and stopping it you can

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.819 
doing starting and stopping it you can
see<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.239> doesn't<00:03:40.480> look<00:03:40.689> too<00:03:40.750> safe<00:03:41.200> it's

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
see that doesn't look too safe it's

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:52.670 
see that doesn't look too safe it's
bending

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.420 

probably<00:03:53.680> could<00:03:53.799> do<00:03:53.980> with<00:03:54.129> a<00:03:54.159> chain

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
probably could do with a chain

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.530 
probably could do with a chain
tightening<00:03:55.950> there's<00:03:56.950> not<00:03:57.069> oh<00:03:57.389> there<00:03:58.389> we<00:03:58.510> go

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
tightening there's not oh there we go

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.879 
tightening there's not oh there we go
there's<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.230> model<00:03:59.379> I<00:04:01.439> mean<00:04:02.439> the<00:04:02.499> camera<00:04:02.739> can

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
there's the model I mean the camera can

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:03.899 
there's the model I mean the camera can
read<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.099> better<00:04:03.159> than<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.459> can

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
read it better than I can

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.509 
read it better than I can
it's<00:04:04.510> freezing<00:04:04.870> cold<00:04:04.900> out<00:04:05.200> here<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.400> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
it's freezing cold out here and the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.039 
it's freezing cold out here and the
cameras<00:04:06.849> not<00:04:06.999> another<00:04:07.239> real<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:08.590> an<00:04:08.859> 860

date<00:04:14.049> code<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:16.470> don't<00:04:17.470> see<00:04:18.459> they<00:04:18.639> core<00:04:18.910> unless

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
date code I don't see they core unless

date code I don't see they core unless
it's<00:04:19.949> 13<00:04:20.949> 21<00:04:21.519> 9<00:04:22.180> 2<00:04:22.630> 2<00:04:24.090> that's<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.570> believe<00:04:25.870> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
it's 13 21 9 2 2 that's I believe the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.810 
it's 13 21 9 2 2 that's I believe the
serial<00:04:26.560> number<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.090> don't<00:04:28.570> see<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> date<00:04:29.410> I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
serial number but I don't see a date I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.400 
serial number but I don't see a date I
don't<00:04:30.820> see<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> date<00:04:31.449> of<00:04:31.479> manufacture<00:04:31.930> there

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
don't see a date of manufacture there

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.680 
don't see a date of manufacture there
are<00:04:32.470> dip<00:04:32.680> switches<00:04:33.009> I<00:04:33.400> mean<00:04:34.240> they're<00:04:34.449> in<00:04:34.599> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
are dip switches I mean they're in the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.469 
are dip switches I mean they're in the
bag<00:04:35.490> that's<00:04:36.490> how<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.729> change<00:04:37.000> different

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
bag that's how you change different

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.900 
bag that's how you change different
settings<00:04:37.539> that<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.349> do<00:04:38.500> with<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.979> don't

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
settings that have to do with it I don't

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.170 
settings that have to do with it I don't
see<00:04:40.479> Amy<00:04:40.870> oh<00:04:43.139> look<00:04:44.139> at<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.729> here's<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.789> service

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
see Amy oh look at that here's a service

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:54.620 
see Amy oh look at that here's a service

probably<00:04:55.630> longer<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.409> business<00:04:56.830> by<00:04:57.009> now<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:01.180> I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
probably longer to business by now but I

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.200 
probably longer to business by now but I
don't<00:05:01.599> see<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.199> year<00:05:02.830> number<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.460> could<00:05:04.000> probably

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
don't see a year number I could probably

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.430 
don't see a year number I could probably
look<00:05:04.360> at<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.570> model<00:05:04.840> number<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.110> figure<00:05:05.409> it

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
look at the model number and figure it

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.779 
look at the model number and figure it
out<00:05:06.599> you<00:05:07.599> know<00:05:07.780> there<00:05:08.199> you<00:05:08.460> hope<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:09.699> you

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
out you know there you hope you see you

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.840 
out you know there you hope you see you
next<00:05:10.000> time<00:05:10.120> till<00:05:10.780> then
