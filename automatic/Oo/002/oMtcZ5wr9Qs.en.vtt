00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I think is nut sedge it looks like a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
I think is nut sedge it looks like a
grass<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.530> truly<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> sedge<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
grass but it's truly a sedge it's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030 
grass but it's truly a sedge it's
