00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.810
 What if we could live on Mars without wearing a space suit? Welcome to the world of reclamation! 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.719
 Hi dear, I'm tris! Thanks for watching (DNews). Re-reclamation merge 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.520
 For Terra (Earth) and Word Formation. Any ... sure you know the meaning of formation. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.070
 It describes the transformation of a strange planet to resemble Earth. The idea 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.629
 Would be to make a planet capable of supporting human life without a space suit. 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.210
 To implement the process in fact we may need decades and even centuries, assuming that it will be 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 Possible! 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.640
 Mars is very suitable for reclamation. Its size is convenient, not too far from the sun, 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.069
 Its atmosphere is light and fluffy. If you stood on Mars as you do now, 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.460
 On the equator, in the middle of the day, in the Martian summer - the temperature will be 80 degrees (27 Celsius) 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.899
 This is almost appropriate. In the winter, the temperature may be approximately 200- (128- C) 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.559
 At night. Mars has little air pressure, so your blood will 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.250
 Boil, your organs will rupture, there is no oxygen you will not be able to breathe. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 No Bueno. Its atmosphere is almost empty and contains carbon dioxide with little nitrogen. In comparison with 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 The Earth's surface is predominantly nitrogen, with a low carbon dioxide content with 20% oxygen. But put all this aside. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.000
 Let's assume that reclamation is possible. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.719
 Copper landing by sails ?? What exactly do we want to do to rehabilitate the Red Planet? 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.840
 We want to reduce UV radiation, increase heat and pressure, put water and treat the atmosphere 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.939
 To become like the planet. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.850
 There are three main theories on how to do this. The first theory: the use of mirrors orbiting the planet 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.140
 (Michigan) to reflect the light and heat of the sun to the surface. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.380
 Put these huge mirrors (incredibly) on the polar ice cap to melt them, releasing co2 gas trapped in the ice. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.899
 A thicker atmosphere will keep the heat warmer than the sun. Then we should just search for oxygen 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.310
 Nitrogen is probably separated by water atoms (H2O)? The second theory: the use of greenhouse gases by production plants 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
 To build an atmosphere (Kid Tress also thought about this) we are also doing this inadvertently 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.180
 In the planet, if we know that technology exists! More greenhouse gases are equal to a hottest planet, 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.370
 The polar ice cover melts and then the same as the previous process. The third theory: striking ice comets 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 In Mars !!! 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.370
 Another one is my favorite for two reasons, the first theory you need 200,000 pounds of mirrors 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is made in space. Both. The second theory requires us to build plants on Mars 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.340
 Which means that it is costly hysterically and will pollute the environment of Mars with human bacteria. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.150
 It's all about us all the time. When bacteria become infected, the process may turn and the process fails 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.349
 my dear! 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.220
 If you see the last video called "Why is there air," you may remember that Earth 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.580
 You are hit by ice comets, spread water and minerals on our planet (baby). 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.290
 The shocks thickened the atmosphere and raised the temperature. If we could do that on Mars, then 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 We can reclaim the Mars without producing potentially invasive bacteria on the surface. 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.510
 I adore it. According to the site (HowStuffWorks), one of the fantastically large asteroids has 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.530
 The heat on Mars raises 3 degrees Celsius. This may dissolve a trillion gallons of water, 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.720
 Making the atmosphere thicker and adding an extra amount of oxygen as well. 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.530
 Of course, any changes in the atmosphere we might make on Mars will slowly come up in space 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.290
 Thanks to solar wind erosion and low gravity. If done correctly. 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.750
 Metal asteroids may mingle with comets in our camp ... A 2008 study was conducted by the University of Toro Thorides 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.819
 How Mars possesses the magnetic heart in the first place, may just be that 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.549
 Restart it! 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.629
 So let's say we can travel to the asteroid belt, hold some massive cosmic rocks, 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.709
 The installation of some nuclear engines on them, which will lead them to a collision course with Mars. Then 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.360
 What!!!!! 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.640
 Then we enter genetically modified bacteria in soil, algae, plants and oxygen 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.920
 Carbon dioxide is a life cycle reducer in an attempt to make the biosphere viable, and in the end ... 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.099
 After centuries and thousands of years we may get blue Mars. Assuming we did not fail in the process 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.079
 Somehow, because there is no second chance. 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.319
 In the end, if we succeed, humans on Mars will stand and breathe in the air outside, 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.870
 They have less attraction there, they have to understand that once the human body exits its performance will weaken in the weak gravity, 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.989
 We hope they understand how they should avoid seasonal storms 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.810
 Which comes at some time during the Martian year. But, do not worry it's the future 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.720
 What we are talking about may be able to do anything? 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.050
