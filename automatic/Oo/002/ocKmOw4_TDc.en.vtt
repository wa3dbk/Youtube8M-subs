coordinator<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.069> would<00:03:23.220> think<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.639> year

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
coordinator so you would think this year

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.729 
coordinator so you would think this year
there<00:03:24.269> would<00:03:24.359> be<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.510> decline<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.319> defense

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
