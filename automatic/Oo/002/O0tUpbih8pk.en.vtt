when<00:02:31.010> you're<00:02:31.190> aware<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.490> them<00:02:32.500> well<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.650> so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
when you're aware of them well it so

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.270 
when you're aware of them well it so
happens<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.960> didn't<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.680> wasn't<00:02:37.100> aware

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

happens that I didn't I wasn't aware
until<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> little<00:02:37.910> bit<00:02:38.060> later<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.800> trip
