of these corners pulling myself against

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.200 
of these corners pulling myself against
this<00:01:45.630> two<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.110> six<00:01:46.409> trying<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> nail<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
this two by six trying to nail that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.410 
this two by six trying to nail that
outside<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:51.500> heard<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.649> huge<00:01:52.680> pop<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
outside and I heard a huge pop and so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
outside and I heard a huge pop and so
I'm<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:54.840> sure<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> cracked<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.680> rib<00:01:55.909> because

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
I'm pretty sure I cracked a rib because

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
I'm pretty sure I cracked a rib because
it's<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.600> hurts<00:01:57.840> every<00:01:58.350> breath<00:01:58.649> now

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.320
