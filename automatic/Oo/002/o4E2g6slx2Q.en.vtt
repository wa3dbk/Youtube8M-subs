00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 purpose of this video is to motivate you 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 for you to go for a walk is super 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.430
 important to do a little exercise 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.769
 cardiovascular and for me walking is the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.750
 best exercise in the world you know 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.330
 I really like to run but I 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.839
 I prefer to walk before I run a thousand 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.580
 a thousand times I prefer to walk because it is 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.610
 our natural state we were designed 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.780
 to be in physical activity 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 constantly and many times then 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 we are in the car we will have left the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.080
 car in the garage and we do not have 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.390
 physical activity then and it's very 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.729
 important to take about 20 to 30 minutes 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.549
 every day to have a little bit of 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.630
 physical activity walking can be something 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.820
 very very pleasure 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.479
 and today I'm going to give you some tips so that 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.539
 motivate you to start walking rally 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.100
 number 1 is that as soon as you get up or 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.140
 whatever we are doing if you 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.299
 like to walk in the night that you drink water 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.579
 First of all, drink water 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.560
 hydrate to me personally I like 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.500
 take at least a liter of water in 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.729
 how I wake up having your clothes 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.100
 exercise if we are going to do it in the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.799
 tomorrow next to your bed so that now 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.659
 yes you already say ok I have no excuses I'm going to 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.750
 go for a walk so you already have your 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.640
 Exercise clothes, you change, buy yourself 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.280
 something that you like that has a color that 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.319
 you like it makes you feel good that you 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.390
 make yourself comfortable if you like 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.399
 Shorts shorts shorts you like a blouse 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.640
 more loose you put a bag more 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 loose something that makes you feel good and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.329
 that is comfortable and number three is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.400
 tennis socks and I love them all 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.459
 colored socks that are like this 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.980
 rich that I'm comfortable and also I 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.630
 love tennis for exercise 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.810
 they can be very funny 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.660
 the bright colors are already some tennis 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.520
 comfortable that I like how they feel 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.190
 to walk to run or to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.130
 any other exercise and you already have your 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.550
 tennis now if you're ready to go out 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.490
 to walk now my tip number 4 is coming 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.980
 and tip number 4 is music or 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.990
 listen to something then it is sometimes more 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.790
 motivating when you're listening to something 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.250
 you can last longer to me in what 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.130
 I like to listen to music like that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.070
 that I get good or even also 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.950
 an audiobook is very good if it's going out 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.770
 to walk you are learning something at the same 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.720
 this time I am going to leave you in fact the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.430
 description of this video some books 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.010
 that I recommend that I like them 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.980
 listen when I go out for a walk tip 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.690
 number 6 is to stretch a little before 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.690
 Go for a walk then take care of your 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.000
 arms your legs with that heats you 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.580
 a little bit before going out for a walk 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.530
 last the tip number 7 is to go out on 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.600
 couple like you have seen in my 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.150
 videoblogs and sometimes something to walk with my 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.680
 mom 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.810
 but in this case I'm going to go out alone 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.370
 then this motivates you a little more to 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.740
 dating someone have someone with 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.260
 who share that time so so 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.390
 nice and special good friends I hope 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.270
 that you really liked this 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.550
 video that motivates them to go for a walk 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.070
 during this challenge we're going to be 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.520
 doing in 14 days I encourage them a lot to 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.580
 that they walk every day of the challenge of 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.940
 20 to 30 minutes every day 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.280
 ok so take your photos share the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.650

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.010
 channel of videoblogs work to blogs 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.640
 so that they are also inspired to walk 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.670

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.700
