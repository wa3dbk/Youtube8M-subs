00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 v the difficulties will be very 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.670
 variable for this feeding of a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.500
 child to another because there are 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.240
 children who are very confident they 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 accept what is asked of them 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 who follow what is needed and for 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.730
 which parents do not have 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 difficulties these same parents besides 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 for another siblings child for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 to be able to have difficulties 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.180
 so children are different one 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.830
 some others some kids are going to have 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.280
 lack of taste for certain foods 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.060
 general these are green vegetables 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.330
 the fish spontaneously he would stay 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.220
 well their diet or rice with paws 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.830
 hidden booty 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.360
 but see but we can have some 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.980
 difficulties also for pieces by 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.300
 example those who would like that 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.070
 the food is completely reel 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.750
 while and they have to eat the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.790
 pieces and then a phenomenon 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.400
 particular who is the age of 2 years 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.780
 the amphora tends to oppose saying 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.150
 not to show that he is master of him and 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.680
 so at that time refused food 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.360
 new gifts that you have to know to be 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 patient it is necessary to represent several 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.210
 times the food to the child under 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.700
 different forms it is necessary to conceive 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.470
 oneself like that could have reassured and 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.880
 so things in most cases 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.100
 it works well when there is a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.590
 worry I think we have to weigh 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.210
 the child measure it and see if its 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.830
 growth is normal of course if the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.330
 growth is normal is that the child 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.180
 certainly has the calorie intake 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.680
 who are often enough the child is 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.750
 brought because he eats nothing but in 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 does one realize that he is a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.720
 normal weight and normal height but 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.640
 they do not eat what is given to him 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.950
 eat at the table but we give him to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.190
 eat after or cookies and cakes 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.780
 treats or things he likes 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.540
 while you still have to try 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.880
 to have a balanced diet so he 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.440
 must parents relax this 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.090
 is not always easy at the moment 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 but it must not be either 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.060
 too authoritarian it is not necessary either 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.630
 that it is too permissive 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.850
 so there is a middle line to hold there 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.710
 must be reassured especially moms the evening 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.960
 meal should always be a source of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 fun a child flaw and so does 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 that they eat their lockers 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 gradually and so it's a pleasure 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.549
 and it has to be fun it stays 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.230
 a pleasure must not be it is a 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.720
 fight part moment when it becomes a 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.720
 fight it's not possible anymore but 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.640
 so we have to be careful too 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.770
 children who with their mother refuse to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.930
 to eat and so at that moment it takes 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.070
 that 1/3 intervenes it can be 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.680
 times the father that will have to be given to 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.350
 eat where the sea ​​by being more more 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.110
 calm finally accepting this failure 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.060
 that she takes as a generic like 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.620
 an accusation like a man like him 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.210
 being specifically addressed as 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.950
 especially if the child eats well at home 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.680
 nurse for example indisputably 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.660
 it is in this period that he goes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.300
 do his food repertoire this is to 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.650
 to say that he will learn to love 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.600
 foods to discover them 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.120
 so it's very important that the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.070
 parents diversify widely 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 feeding the child a phase 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.300
 know a lot of green vegetables 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 a lot of milk various meats etc 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.480
 it also depends on what the parents 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.430
 buy that is to say what is there at 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.140
 fridge for example often the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.000
 children consume sodas it's not 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 very well she and fruit juice times 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.340
 the parents say ah but it's juice 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.990
 fruit is as good as free no 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.250
 it's not as good as the fruit 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.870
 better that they eat the fruits than 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.400
 drink fruit juice or wood 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.750
 waiting and excessive is not 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.459
 to ban at all from drinking juice from 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.660
 fruits are not sentenced either 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.220
 complete believe the good words and we do not 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.650
 do not talk about it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.620
 become an attitude a habit a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.959
 new food or what the treats 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.370
 we see that when moms do not have 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.049
 or do not put the vegetables often the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.739
 finally not all children but some 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.030
 kids do not have them either so 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.860
 there is a mother to do 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 attention has proposed to the child 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.150
 food that steps a step 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.319
 herself but if the father liked her 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.670
 long time they want it kids 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.620
 see that lose the consumes too or 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.540
 than other children of the siblings of 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.860
 consumption 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.599
 I think he does not want spinach 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.890
 do not insist 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.870
 likewise we must not tell him ends 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.950
 in the plate and no longer hungry he is 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.319
 normal that they stop eating 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.379
 so you do not have to have an attitude 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.359
 too much authoritarian hired he must but he 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.010
 must also wants to show a 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.840
 little bit of firmness in any case by 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.609
 example take the case of spinach he 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.870
 do not have any danger today good we him 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.220
 representing a rise once in form 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.039
 spinach with cream or in the form of 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.889
 different sailboats and its 2 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.510
 you have to know how to represent food 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.160
 many times he has a lot of studies 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.880
 that have been done and that show that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.760
 to represent the food to the child is going 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.110
 familiarize him with the food and who is going 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.030
 eat it more easily 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.130
 also remember that we can take the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.610
 children to the market for him to see the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.719
 even vegetables and fruits at the market 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.490
 we can also show him gardens 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.560
 as in addition to carrots how does it get 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.180
 pass and it's again a woman 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.680
 is the laughing stock and reassuring him about 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.680
 to foods that you do not know
