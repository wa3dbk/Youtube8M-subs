00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
somebody else did showing the exact same

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
somebody else did showing the exact same
spot<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.100> awesome<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
spot I think it's really awesome and I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
spot I think it's really awesome and I
would<00:01:35.820> encourage<00:01:36.090> again<00:01:36.509> everyone<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
would encourage again everyone to do it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
would encourage again everyone to do it
so<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> first<00:01:38.790> grenades<00:01:39.180> thought<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> I'd

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so this first grenades thought that I'd

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.120 
so this first grenades thought that I'd
like<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> show<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.079> guys<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:40.860> killing

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
like to show you guys is for killing

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
like to show you guys is for killing
someone<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> flag<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
someone all of the a flag if you are in

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.740 
someone all of the a flag if you are in
the<00:01:43.229> tin<00:01:43.500> building<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> B<00:01:44.670> flag<00:01:44.970> holding

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the tin building over the B flag holding

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
the tin building over the B flag holding
down<00:01:45.869> both<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.409> B<00:01:46.979> simultaneously<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
down both a and B simultaneously is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
down both a and B simultaneously is
probably<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.140> best<00:01:49.409> flag<00:01:49.619> combination<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
probably the best flag combination to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
probably the best flag combination to
have<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.820> firing<00:01:51.119> range<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.960> often<00:01:52.350> you'll

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
have on firing range so often you'll

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
have on firing range so often you'll
find<00:01:52.500> yourself<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.070> situations<00:01:53.670> where<00:01:53.850> you're

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
find yourself in situations where you're

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
find yourself in situations where you're
trying<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.299> defend<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> B<00:01:54.869> flag<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
trying to defend the B flag from the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.020 
trying to defend the B flag from the
center<00:01:56.130> building<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> need

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
center building and you're going to need

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
center building and you're going to need
to<00:01:57.180> kill<00:01:57.390> somebody<00:01:57.780> who<00:01:57.930> tries<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.439> capture

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to kill somebody who tries to capture

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
to kill somebody who tries to capture
the<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.159> flat<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.780> throwing<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> grenade

the a flat so when throwing this grenade

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
the a flat so when throwing this grenade
over<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> Crowsnest<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> couple<00:02:02.909> things

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030

like seven
-<00:02:12.840> 80<00:02:13.200> %<00:02:13.709> upwards<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.969> then<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.209> third<00:02:15.420> thing

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
- 80 % upwards and then the third thing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.179 
- 80 % upwards and then the third thing
you're<00:02:15.689> gonna<00:02:15.870> want<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.109> do<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.499> align

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
you're gonna want to do is align

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.069 
you're gonna want to do is align
yourself<00:02:17.609> with<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.939> a<00:02:18.090> flag<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
yourself with the a flag so that the

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.289 
yourself with the a flag so that the
grenade<00:02:19.379> lands<00:02:19.889> almost<00:02:20.099> directly<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
grenade lands almost directly on the

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.569 
grenade lands almost directly on the
center<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.749> it<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.049> in<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:22.889> example<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.430> threw

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
center of it and in this example I threw

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.890 
center of it and in this example I threw
a<00:02:23.639> little<00:02:23.849> bit<00:02:24.060> too<00:02:24.180> much<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.629> right<00:02:24.780> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a little bit too much to the right but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360 
a little bit too much to the right but
it<00:02:25.019> was<00:02:25.109> still<00:02:25.409> killed<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.829> person<00:02:26.219> and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it was still killed the person and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.339 
it was still killed the person and
that's<00:02:27.060> typically<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:27.659> you'll<00:02:27.840> find<00:02:28.049> in

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
that's typically what you'll find in

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.619 
that's typically what you'll find in
this<00:02:28.439> grenade<00:02:28.709> spot<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.909> this<00:02:30.120> next<00:02:30.299> grenades

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
this grenade spot so this next grenades

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.670 
this grenade spot so this next grenades
well<00:02:30.810> I'm<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.079> show<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.200> guys<00:02:31.409> is

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
well I'm going to show you guys is

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
well I'm going to show you guys is
really<00:02:32.069> useful<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.579> pretty<00:02:32.760> much<00:02:32.849> any<00:02:33.209> game

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
really useful for pretty much any game

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.179 
really useful for pretty much any game
mode<00:02:33.689> on<00:02:33.870> firing<00:02:34.200> range<00:02:34.530> you'll<00:02:34.769> often<00:02:35.010> find

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
mode on firing range you'll often find

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.890 
mode on firing range you'll often find
yourself<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.790> situations<00:02:36.389> where<00:02:36.599> somebody

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
yourself in situations where somebody

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.330 
yourself in situations where somebody
will<00:02:37.049> be<00:02:37.079> sitting<00:02:37.409> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> top<00:02:37.889> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.129> wood

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
will be sitting in the top of the wood

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.789 
will be sitting in the top of the wood
building<00:02:38.760> behind<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.629> sandbags<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.469> that<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
building behind the sandbags and that is
