I'm<00:05:52.279> going<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.610> blend<00:05:52.879> this<00:05:53.029> with<00:05:53.270> a

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
I'm going to blend this with a

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:16.140 
I'm going to blend this with a
retractable<00:05:53.749> lip<00:05:54.259> brush

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150 

so<00:06:16.960> as<00:06:17.169> you<00:06:17.290> probably<00:06:17.320> noticed<00:06:17.949> when<00:06:18.130> I

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
so as you probably noticed when I

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.159 
so as you probably noticed when I
applied<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:18.790> I<00:06:18.970> applied<00:06:19.510> with<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.720> dopher

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
applied that I applied with the dopher

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.129 
applied that I applied with the dopher
and<00:06:20.350> I<00:06:20.740> went<00:06:21.010> almost<00:06:21.729> up<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.600> lip<00:06:22.750> line<00:06:22.930> but

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
and I went almost up to the lip line but

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.600 
and I went almost up to the lip line but
then<00:06:23.290> blended<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.860> up<00:06:23.919> to<00:06:24.040> the<00:06:24.160> lip<00:06:24.250> line<00:06:24.430> with

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
then blended it up to the lip line with

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.400 
then blended it up to the lip line with
a<00:06:24.639> lip<00:06:24.850> brush<00:06:24.880> and<00:06:25.240> that's<00:06:25.389> just<00:06:25.720> so<00:06:25.960> it<00:06:26.229> looks

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
a lip brush and that's just so it looks

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.710 
a lip brush and that's just so it looks
much<00:06:26.830> much<00:06:27.100> softer<00:06:27.729> there's<00:06:28.270> a<00:06:28.330> different

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
much much softer there's a different

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.480 
much much softer there's a different
shade<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.020> red<00:06:29.169> for<00:06:29.380> everyone<00:06:29.889> so<00:06:30.100> if<00:06:30.220> you<00:06:30.310> feel

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
shade of red for everyone so if you feel

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.830 
shade of red for everyone so if you feel
this<00:06:30.639> is<00:06:30.699> a<00:06:30.820> bit<00:06:31.000> bright<00:06:31.240> for<00:06:31.540> you

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
this is a bit bright for you

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.240 
this is a bit bright for you
then<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.260> could<00:06:32.500> try<00:06:32.650> something<00:06:33.160> a<00:06:33.220> bit

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
then you could try something a bit

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.159 
then you could try something a bit
darker<00:06:33.580> I'll<00:06:34.000> put<00:06:34.180> this<00:06:34.270> one<00:06:34.449> on<00:06:34.479> as<00:06:34.810> well<00:06:34.990> so

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
darker I'll put this one on as well so

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.230 
darker I'll put this one on as well so
you<00:06:35.229> can<00:06:35.500> see<00:06:35.680> and<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:35.889> is<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.610> much<00:06:36.790> darker

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
you can see and that is the much darker

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.150 
you can see and that is the much darker
red<00:06:37.389> now<00:06:37.780> actually<00:06:38.320> either<00:06:38.530> of<00:06:38.740> these<00:06:38.860> can<00:06:39.040> be

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
red now actually either of these can be

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.860 
red now actually either of these can be
worn<00:06:39.370> on<00:06:39.460> any<00:06:39.760> skin<00:06:40.030> tone<00:06:40.090> but<00:06:40.389> it's<00:06:40.510> what<00:06:40.690> you
