00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the old ship is very strange because the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.889

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
there are margin was here but who set up

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.370 
there are margin was here but who set up
is<00:02:08.330> safar<00:02:09.330> setup

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
is safar setup

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.100 
is safar setup
so<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.820> fish<00:02:12.030> brother<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.480> always<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> cutter
