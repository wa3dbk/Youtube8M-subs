00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
tell you it's not going to sound like a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.380 
tell you it's not going to sound like a
boxer<00:02:32.830> engine<00:02:33.190> anymore<00:02:33.490> after<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.120> install

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
this this equal length design is going

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.870 
this this equal length design is going
to<00:02:37.060> orchestrate<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.810> smooth<00:02:38.490> balanced<00:02:39.490> sound

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
to orchestrate a smooth balanced sound

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.570 
to orchestrate a smooth balanced sound
from<00:02:40.330> cylinder<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.140> cylinder<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.830> uniformity

from cylinder to cylinder in uniformity

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.980 
from cylinder to cylinder in uniformity
and<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> sound<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
and it's going to be a sound that you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:03:07.940 
and it's going to be a sound that you
could<00:02:44.140> feel

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.170 

one<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> main<00:03:09.310> problems<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.970> that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
one of the main problems is that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.910 
one of the main problems is that
sometimes<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.900> exhaust<00:03:11.170> metal<00:03:11.500> tools<00:03:11.710> are

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
sometimes the exhaust metal tools are

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.490 
sometimes the exhaust metal tools are
way<00:03:12.220> too<00:03:12.280> close<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> oil<00:03:13.270> pan<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.840> when

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
way too close to the oil pan and when

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.320 
way too close to the oil pan and when
the<00:03:14.620> pipe<00:03:14.890> layout<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.430> way<00:03:15.610> too<00:03:15.670> close<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
the pipe layout is way too close to the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.380 
the pipe layout is way too close to the
oil<00:03:16.510> pan<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:17.410> when<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.740> get<00:03:17.860> some<00:03:18.100> damage

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
oil pan that's when you get some damage

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.420 
oil pan that's when you get some damage
from<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.540> heat<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.230> oil<00:03:20.470> pan<00:03:20.680> produces

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
from the heat that the oil pan produces

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.520 
from the heat that the oil pan produces
and<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.120> why<00:03:22.270> we've<00:03:22.600> included<00:03:22.900> the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
and so that's why we've included the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.030 
and so that's why we've included the
band-aid<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:25.000> band-aid<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.600> used<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.860> wrap

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
band-aid this band-aid is used to wrap

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.610 
band-aid this band-aid is used to wrap
around<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.640> whole<00:03:27.880> exhaust<00:03:28.270> manifold<00:03:28.810> to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
around the whole exhaust manifold to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.500 
around the whole exhaust manifold to
avoid<00:03:29.920> any<00:03:30.100> problems<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:31.000> are<00:03:31.120> related<00:03:31.210> to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
avoid any problems that are related to

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.070 
avoid any problems that are related to
the<00:03:31.720> heat<00:03:31.960> produced<00:03:32.890> by<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> oil<00:03:33.550> pan<00:03:33.870> as<00:03:34.870> you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
the heat produced by the oil pan as you

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.930 
the heat produced by the oil pan as you
can<00:03:35.230> see<00:03:35.380> here<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.740> pipe<00:03:36.010> layout<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.640> made

can see here this pipe layout is made

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.530 
can see here this pipe layout is made
especially<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.890> avoid<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.370> oil<00:03:39.400> pan<00:03:39.880> but

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
especially to avoid the oil pan but

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.810 
especially to avoid the oil pan but
still<00:03:40.780> maintaining<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.500> nice<00:03:41.740> smooth<00:03:42.310> curve
