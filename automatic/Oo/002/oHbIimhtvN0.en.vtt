00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to charge it is to lay the drive itself

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.049 
to charge it is to lay the drive itself
on<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> dock<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.770> instantly<00:00:41.430> charge

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.170 
on to the dock and you instantly charge
it<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.930> simple<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:44.000> know<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.090> to

it it's very simple you know what to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
it it's very simple you know what to
fiddle<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.629> accessing<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.950> ports<00:00:47.309> or

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fiddle with accessing the ports or

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
fiddle with accessing the ports or
anything<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:49.039> also<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
anything like that also you have a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.330 
anything like that also you have a
external<00:00:51.270> speaker<00:00:51.660> system<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.890> hook<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
external speaker system you can hook it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.119 
external speaker system you can hook it
up<00:00:53.430> through<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.620> soon<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
up through the back so as soon as you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
up through the back so as soon as you
dock<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> port<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.500> all<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.739> audio<00:00:59.070> will

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
dock the port you can all the audio will

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
dock the port you can all the audio will
be<00:00:59.489> routed<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.210> external<00:01:00.750> speakers

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
be routed to your external speakers

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
be routed to your external speakers
which<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:01.920> nice<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.520> convenient<00:01:04.010> with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
which is pretty nice and convenient with

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
which is pretty nice and convenient with
the<00:01:05.220> dock<00:01:06.060> itself<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.780> lightweight<00:01:07.020> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the dock itself is pretty lightweight so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
the dock itself is pretty lightweight so
when<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> lift<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.340> stays<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
when you lift it up it stays on the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.289 
when you lift it up it stays on the
drive<00:01:10.229> itself<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.700> remove<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
drive itself so to remove it you just

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.149 
drive itself so to remove it you just
lay<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.689> hand<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> back<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.890> lift

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
also you got a very small footprint

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
also you got a very small footprint
compared<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> something<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.140> stand<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
compared to something like a stand that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
compared to something like a stand that
takes<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.210> significantly<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.909> footprint

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
takes up significantly more footprint

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.069 
takes up significantly more footprint
because<00:01:57.899> you're<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.509> that's<00:02:00.509> another

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
because you're there so that's another

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.120 
because you're there so that's another
benefit<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> having<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.369> dock<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.920> one<00:02:04.920> issue

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
benefit to having a dock so one issue

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.520 
benefit to having a dock so one issue
with<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> audio<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.149> though<00:02:06.479> people<00:02:07.290> were
