00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone, today we have only 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:13.620
 An interesting project was drawn so not 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:19.830
 badly blasted panel from the mayor himself if 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.680
 such a whole panel of us, too, from mats to us 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 it is necessary to paint this panel 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.439
 the color of this panel here I am at the boys 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 asked me on the radio there they suggested 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.430
 Chuka where I will do it for the first time 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.309
 Hello guys, thanks now we are with her 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 all that you can remove moldings there any 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.700
 woman and we will paint there in addition to gas 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.640
 approximately an explanation of what 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 buy will buy watch what's there 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.890
 We will work in this direction 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.460
 on cool on goat just materialchik 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 although there is a soft but there you paint 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 we paint with you so that nothing 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.780
 scratched did not get dirty in general 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.400
 such small precautions 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 the point here and disassembled the panel seems to be 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.729
 nothing is almost 9 box in general 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.619
 forbidden going in general such 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.840
 presumptive advice likely 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.020
 the panel is always rubbed there with all sorts 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.299
 waxes for shine all sorts of name and in short 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 I took the diluted soapy water and wiped it 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.340
 on how would such a little roll 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.609
 apparently 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.229
 maybe almost dry was not know about 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.829
 how soaked it all 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.740
 and brushing is fine but plenty of water is not 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.810
 you just need it was important and everything is all here 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 so good still especially these here all 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.130
 these seams where here's how the junction 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.250
 Well, this panel is just where they are 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.420
 valuable everything went 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.950
 now she is now i'm her good still abdul 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.049
 especially all of these here is quite water 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.009
 nothing left 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.519
 then another pass is required to 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.870
 degrease well, I have such a thing 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:20.769
 there is a nozzle disappears 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 write channel will pass well and everything and 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:29.319
 there will be errors deliberately on the overall composition 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.470
 the other is as smooth as 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:41.440
 bail so here is how clean additionally 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.709
 budget with that kind of sprays and then 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.700
 before painting once again run around 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.140
 respectively 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 In short, I found these cans 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.310
 special for the salon they are here 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.099
 to paint myself I pierced them because with 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.680
 spray can decorate them well nafig here I 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.150
 poured black just a little panel 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 with him the color of baht is now I 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.030
 Here I bought a blue duku color and black 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.440
 the ball will mix a little so here pierced 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.579
 You should be careful not 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.109
 and I will impose with a gun 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:23.489
 We'll see this is the panel 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.349
 let's see what it is then well, that's a 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.609
 good with kalyaka turned out 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.609
 this is for the first time 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.660
 but 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.660
 ok so blocked 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.900
 it is special and colored by these 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.569
 spray can before 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.000
 but of course I didnâ€™t paint torpedoes 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.790
 door panels still something beautiful homeland 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.990
 back off 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.940
 inspection here it is 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.940
 here it is the old panel 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.940
 now we are still 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.710
 for hold 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.510
 more precisely for used dofiga 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.540
 beautiful at all 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 that's how the socket turned out painted and 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.829
 overlaps this color three times well 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.890
 trailers, I wasted so much for the bug 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.210
 him i'm shorter than three black cans 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.730
 opened and 1 blue had a pancake open 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.730
 1 black 1 blue then on the beans 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 because what's left on the bottle poured 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.220
 dofiga shorter mean there will be no sport 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.540
 No, everyone, good luck, everyone, bye 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.170

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:53.630
 here's a fresh kid of course painted stingy 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.630
 there is no turning back you will do 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:06.610
 for i have to keep everything ok but 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.060
 a jar is written that will hold on 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.060
 let's hope
