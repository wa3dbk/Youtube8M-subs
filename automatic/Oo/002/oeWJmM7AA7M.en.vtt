just<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:45.840> general<00:00:46.020> information

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
just kind of some general information

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.400 
just kind of some general information
this<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> pretty<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.360> bread<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> butter

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this is pretty much the bread and butter

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
this is pretty much the bread and butter
of<00:00:50.329> iPhone<00:00:51.329> cases<00:00:52.050> well<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.039> make<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.460> think

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
of iPhone cases well they make I think

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
of iPhone cases well they make I think
they<00:00:53.940> make<00:00:54.090> lifeproof<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.570> other<00:00:54.660> models<00:00:55.020> too

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
they make lifeproof for other models too

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
they make lifeproof for other models too
but<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.280> much<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> bread<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but this is pretty much the bread and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
but this is pretty much the bread and
butter<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.020> strongest<00:00:58.469> case<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
butter for the strongest case so you can

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
butter for the strongest case so you can
pretty<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.250> possibly<00:00:59.789> buy<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> most

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
pretty much possibly buy the most

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
pretty much possibly buy the most
durable<00:01:00.660> case<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.530> course<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.949> safest

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
durable case and of course the safest

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.390 
durable case and of course the safest
case<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.510> submerge<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.890> 6.6

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it is use the unit so the first part and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.840 
it is use the unit so the first part and
you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.770> let<00:02:10.920> me<00:02:10.950> start<00:02:11.250> off<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.520> say<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
you know let me start off and say it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.790 
you know let me start off and say it
this<00:02:12.210> thing<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.810> expensive<00:02:13.350> for<00:02:13.740> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this thing is really expensive for a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.600 
this thing is really expensive for a
piece<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.100> plastic<00:02:14.550> 80<00:02:15.510> bucks

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
piece of plastic 80 bucks

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.760 
piece of plastic 80 bucks
but<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.910> guess<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.540> safest<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
but I guess it is the safest that you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.280 
but I guess it is the safest that you
could<00:02:20.070> get<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> we<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> cleaning<00:02:22.140> cloth
