chimpanzees but unfortunately chimps

chimpanzees but unfortunately chimps
happen<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.819> be<00:01:43.939> caught<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.149> these<00:01:44.359> traps<00:01:44.420> and

they move with these traps

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.279 
they move with these traps
it's<00:01:46.969> amazing<00:01:47.479> how<00:01:47.600> strong<00:01:47.869> they're<00:01:48.109> they

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
it's amazing how strong they're they

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.389 
it's amazing how strong they're they
move<00:01:48.529> for<00:01:48.799> kilometres<00:01:49.630> dragging<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.810> trap

so<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> leg<00:01:52.609> was<00:01:52.789> totally<00:01:53.149> crushed<00:01:53.359> and<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
so a leg was totally crushed and the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.349 
so a leg was totally crushed and the
first<00:01:54.679> thought<00:01:54.920> was<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:55.759> euthanize<00:01:56.119> her

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
first thought was to euthanize her

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.120 
first thought was to euthanize her
because<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.869> looked<00:01:57.049> bad<00:01:57.229> really<00:01:57.560> bad

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
because it looked bad really bad

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.190 
because it looked bad really bad
we<00:01:58.819> thought<00:01:59.029> it<00:01:59.209> shouldn't<00:01:59.599> make<00:01:59.719> it<00:01:59.779> but<00:02:00.079> then

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
we thought it shouldn't make it but then

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.830 
we thought it shouldn't make it but then
we<00:02:00.349> took<00:02:00.579> bold<00:02:01.579> decision<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.270> say<00:02:02.420> no<00:02:02.630> we

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
we took bold decision and say no we
