00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
I think and it just happened to be an

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.360 
I think and it just happened to be an
easy<00:03:52.260> game<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.739> bit<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.190> surprise

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370

was<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.060> easy

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
was so easy

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.530 
was so easy
but<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.549> still<00:04:02.819> do<00:04:02.970> have<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.209> play<00:04:03.389> another
