00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.470 
cool look so here's what I'm going to do
I'm<00:00:49.720> gonna<00:00:49.809> break<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.080> down<00:00:50.290> into<00:00:50.500> two<00:00:50.589> parts

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I'm gonna break it down into two parts

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400 
I'm gonna break it down into two parts
but<00:00:52.480> I'm<00:00:52.570> just<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:52.839> to<00:00:52.930> with<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.230> one

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
but I'm just going to with the one

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.770 
but I'm just going to with the one
caveat<00:00:53.650> it's<00:00:54.160> it's<00:00:54.489> one<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.970> those<00:00:55.180> licks<00:00:55.600> that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
caveat it's it's one of those licks that

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.469 
caveat it's it's one of those licks that
I<00:00:56.110> can<00:00:56.379> play<00:00:56.680> up<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:56.979> speed<00:00:57.400> no<00:00:57.699> problem<00:00:58.269> but

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
I can play up to speed no problem but

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.210 
I can play up to speed no problem but
then<00:00:58.629> when<00:00:58.839> I<00:00:58.870> slow<00:00:59.409> it<00:00:59.440> down<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.979> try<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
then when I slow it down and try to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.030 
then when I slow it down and try to
explain<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:01.629> kind<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.379> get<00:01:02.470> lost<00:01:02.650> in<00:01:02.890> it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
explain it I kind of get lost in it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.590 
explain it I kind of get lost in it
becomes<00:01:03.280> more<00:01:03.460> frustrating<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.059> teach<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.479> I'm

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
becomes more frustrating to teach so I'm

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.880 
becomes more frustrating to teach so I'm
just<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.930> try<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.080> play<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.379> really<00:01:05.500> slow

here's<00:01:33.700> part<00:01:33.939> one

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.970 

that's<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.210> part<00:01:39.510> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.660> lick<00:01:39.980> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.820 

so<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.600> go<00:02:12.690> ahead<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.020> play<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.560> part

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so just go ahead and just play that part

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
so just go ahead and just play that part
of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> video<00:02:14.220> over<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:14.910> over<00:02:15.000> again<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.330> just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of the video over and over again I just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.330 
of the video over and over again I just
it's<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.020> know<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:16.440> going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.710> lost<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.220> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's I know I'm going to get lost in and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
it's I know I'm going to get lost in and
if<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> try<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.760> teach<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.360> there's<00:02:18.630> if

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
if I try to teach it but there's if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.020 
if I try to teach it but there's if
there's<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.530> thing<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.430> kind<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
there's one thing that I kind of like to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.240 
there's one thing that I kind of like to
point<00:02:21.300> out<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.630> least<00:02:21.720> technique<00:02:22.170> wise<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.740> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
point out at least technique wise is to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
point out at least technique wise is to
make<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.580> easy<00:02:23.880> you're<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> use

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
make this easy you're gonna have to use

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.910 
make this easy you're gonna have to use
your<00:02:25.310> ring<00:02:26.310> finger<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.760> bar<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:28.470> part<00:02:28.770> right

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
your ring finger to bar that part right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.940 
your ring finger to bar that part right
there<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:31.310> right<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:34.320> much<00:02:34.470> easier<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
there so right there it's much easier to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.540 
there so right there it's much easier to
bar<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:36.320> right<00:02:37.320> there<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.950> actually<00:02:38.370> try

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bar that right there then actually try

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.460 
bar that right there then actually try
to<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.970> individually<00:02:39.600> front<00:02:39.900> by<00:02:40.020> friend<00:02:40.350> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
to do it individually front by friend so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.350 
to do it individually front by friend so
that's<00:02:40.650> something<00:02:41.010> that's<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.240> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that's something that's that you have to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880 
that's something that's that you have to
kind<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.720> used<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.560> lot<00:02:43.710> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
kind of get used to but there's a lot of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.430 
kind of get used to but there's a lot of
there's<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.910> lot<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.180> ringing<00:02:45.450> notes<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.170> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
there's a lot of ringing notes in this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.040 
there's a lot of ringing notes in this
phrase<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:47.040> again<00:02:47.790> finally<00:02:48.330> one<00:02:48.720> more<00:02:48.840> time

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
phrase so again finally one more time

00:02:49.050 --> 00:03:00.160 
phrase so again finally one more time
first<00:02:49.350> part<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.890> this

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:19.030 

and<00:03:01.170> here's<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> second<00:03:02.040> part<00:03:08.959> slowly

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.780 

now<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.540> only<00:03:21.990> thing<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.500> was<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.830> tough

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
now the only thing that was really tough

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.000 
now the only thing that was really tough
for<00:03:24.120> me<00:03:24.270> actually<00:03:24.870> when<00:03:25.200> actually<00:03:25.710> learning

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
for me actually when actually learning

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.430 
for me actually when actually learning
this<00:03:26.250> lick<00:03:26.840> was<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> fact<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.230> I'm

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
this lick was the fact that I'm

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.200 
this lick was the fact that I'm
everybody's<00:03:29.310> used<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.670> seeing<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.940> fretboard

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
everybody's used to seeing the fretboard

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.640 
everybody's used to seeing the fretboard
the<00:03:30.540> wrong<00:03:30.660> way<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.870> kind<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.380> view<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the wrong way I kind of view the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.400 
the wrong way I kind of view the
fretboard<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.220> shapes<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.960> kind<00:03:34.260> of

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
fretboard in shapes and so I'm kind of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.830 
fretboard in shapes and so I'm kind of
used<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.800> seeing<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.360> know<00:03:36.390> box

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
used to seeing it in this you know box

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.750 
used to seeing it in this you know box
shape<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.810> where<00:03:40.800> we<00:03:40.920> started<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.430> here

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
shape and then where we started up here

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.970 
shape and then where we started up here
and<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:43.140> kind<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> shift<00:03:43.710> into

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and so to actually kind of shift into

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.170 
and so to actually kind of shift into
these<00:03:44.130> notes<00:03:44.460> when<00:03:44.760> you're<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.030> from

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.920 

right<00:03:53.180> here<00:03:53.510> into<00:03:53.810> this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.740 

took<00:03:59.739> me<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> little<00:04:00.250> getting<00:04:00.909> used<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.330> because

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
took me a little getting used to because

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.630 
took me a little getting used to because
I<00:04:01.840> wasn't<00:04:02.049> used<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.530> actually<00:04:02.709> I'm<00:04:03.280> used<00:04:03.549> to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
I wasn't used to actually I'm used to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.990 
I wasn't used to actually I'm used to
seeing<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.569> fretboard<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.879> instead<00:04:06.879> of

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
seeing the fretboard like instead of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.350 
seeing the fretboard like instead of
doing<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.860> was<00:04:09.069> really<00:04:09.400> foreign<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.909> me<00:04:10.090> so

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
doing that was really foreign to me so

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.809 
doing that was really foreign to me so
if<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.440> hangs<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.950> up<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.190> little<00:04:12.310> bit<00:04:12.610> if

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
if that hangs you up a little bit if

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.860 
if that hangs you up a little bit if
you're<00:04:13.030> used<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.299> kind<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.599> seeing<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
you're used to kind of seeing the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.390 
you're used to kind of seeing the
fretboard<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.440> way<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.860> seeing<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.280> with

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
fretboard the way I was seeing it with

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.400 
fretboard the way I was seeing it with
the<00:04:15.489> pentatonic<00:04:16.000> shape<00:04:16.030> there<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:17.019> know

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
the pentatonic shape there you know

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.400 
the pentatonic shape there you know
don't<00:04:17.979> fret<00:04:18.220> no<00:04:18.459> pun<00:04:18.609> intended<00:04:19.169> you'll<00:04:20.169> figure

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
don't fret no pun intended you'll figure

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.129 
don't fret no pun intended you'll figure
it<00:04:20.530> out<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.880> it'll<00:04:22.030> it'll<00:04:22.330> feel<00:04:22.630> natural

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
it out and it'll it'll feel natural

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.770 
it out and it'll it'll feel natural
after<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> while<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:24.100> it's<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.310> really<00:04:24.820> really

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
after a while but it's a really really

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.050 
after a while but it's a really really
cool<00:04:25.990> run<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.100> let's<00:04:27.310> go<00:04:27.520> ahead<00:04:27.729> and<00:04:27.850> do<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
cool run so let's go ahead and do the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:45.410 
cool run so let's go ahead and do the
whole<00:04:28.090> thing<00:04:28.240> slowly<00:04:28.889> one<00:04:29.889> time

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:59.740 

and<00:04:46.420> one<00:04:47.140> time<00:04:47.940> up<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.150> speed

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.959 

and<00:05:00.750> that's<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.110> there's<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.800> much<00:05:01.949> more<00:05:02.280> here

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
and that's it there's so much more here

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.449 
and that's it there's so much more here
in<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.120> MS
