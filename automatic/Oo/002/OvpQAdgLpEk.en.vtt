00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
how to effectively train some of the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.760 
how to effectively train some of the
small<00:00:21.990> stabilizing<00:00:22.990> muscles<00:00:23.320> around<00:00:23.439> your

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
small stabilizing muscles around your

small stabilizing muscles around your
shoulder<00:00:24.099> blades<00:00:24.599> when<00:00:25.599> I<00:00:25.630> was<00:00:25.810> at<00:00:25.930> the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.980 
Tate and the guys from elite again I got
to<00:00:30.279> test<00:00:30.490> a<00:00:30.699> lot<00:00:30.880> of<00:00:31.029> these<00:00:31.119> guys<00:00:31.359> and<00:00:31.779> one<00:00:31.900> of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
to test a lot of these guys and one of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.990 
to test a lot of these guys and one of
the<00:00:32.080> common<00:00:32.439> issues<00:00:32.739> I<00:00:32.890> found<00:00:33.160> was<00:00:33.519> they<00:00:33.940> were

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
the common issues I found was they were

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.729 
the common issues I found was they were
very<00:00:34.090> unstable<00:00:34.780> through<00:00:35.170> their<00:00:35.320> upper<00:00:35.559> back

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
very unstable through their upper back

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.829 
very unstable through their upper back
and<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.640> may<00:00:36.879> sound<00:00:37.150> kind<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.390> like<00:00:37.449> a<00:00:37.570> misnomer

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
and it may sound kind of like a misnomer

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.990 
and it may sound kind of like a misnomer
but<00:00:38.530> when<00:00:39.160> you're<00:00:39.280> talking<00:00:39.400> about<00:00:39.670> guys<00:00:39.790> that

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
but when you're talking about guys that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.640 
but when you're talking about guys that
are<00:00:40.089> handling<00:00:40.360> five<00:00:40.629> six<00:00:41.019> seven<00:00:41.320> hundred

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
are handling five six seven hundred

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.500 
are handling five six seven hundred
pounds<00:00:42.030> unfortunately<00:00:43.030> sometimes<00:00:43.210> they're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
pounds unfortunately sometimes they're

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.270 
pounds unfortunately sometimes they're
prime<00:00:43.780> movers<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.379> too<00:00:44.589> strong

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
prime movers get too strong

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.490 
prime movers get too strong
for<00:00:45.579> those<00:00:45.700> smaller<00:00:46.200> stabilizing<00:00:47.200> muscle

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
for those smaller stabilizing muscle

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.110 
for those smaller stabilizing muscle
groups<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.980> when<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.489> got<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.670> guy<00:00:48.879> that's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
groups and when you got a guy that's

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.520 
groups and when you got a guy that's
bench<00:00:49.329> pressing<00:00:49.750> five<00:00:49.960> six<00:00:50.230> seven<00:00:50.469> hundred

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
bench pressing five six seven hundred

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.350 
bench pressing five six seven hundred
pounds<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.309> need<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.579> make<00:00:51.789> sure<00:00:51.820> there's<00:00:52.180> as

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
pounds you need to make sure there's as

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.510 
pounds you need to make sure there's as
strong<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.410> it's<00:00:53.800> stable<00:00:54.070> through<00:00:54.399> their

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
strong and it's stable through their

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.250 
strong and it's stable through their
upper<00:00:54.670> back<00:00:54.940> as<00:00:55.120> possible<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:55.960> while<00:00:56.140> these

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
upper back as possible so while these

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.860 
upper back as possible so while these
exercises<00:00:56.949> may<00:00:57.160> look<00:00:57.460> kind<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.940> easy<00:00:58.180> what<00:00:58.840> I

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
exercises may look kind of easy what I

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.540 
exercises may look kind of easy what I
really<00:00:59.410> want<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.680> guys<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.859> focus<00:01:00.129> on<00:01:00.399> is

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
really want you guys to focus on is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.500 

okay<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.130> we're<00:01:10.369> going<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.549> demonstrate<00:01:10.760> the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
okay so we're going to demonstrate the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.770 
okay so we're going to demonstrate the
why<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.500> T<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.280> these<00:01:14.090> exercises<00:01:14.690> were

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
why the T and the I these exercises were

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.840 
why the T and the I these exercises were
actually<00:01:15.110> popularized<00:01:15.799> by<00:01:15.920> Mark<00:01:16.340> were<00:01:16.460> stayin

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
first position oh why is it set up at a

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.170 
first position oh why is it set up at a
10<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.380> 2<00:01:27.500> position<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.000> see

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
10 and 2 position so you can see

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.670 
10 and 2 position so you can see
Stevie's<00:01:29.540> got<00:01:29.720> his<00:01:29.840> thumbs<00:01:30.110> up<00:01:30.320> that's<00:01:30.500> gonna

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
Stevie's got his thumbs up that's gonna

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.560 
Stevie's got his thumbs up that's gonna
help<00:01:30.890> engage<00:01:31.100> as<00:01:31.399> external<00:01:31.850> rotators<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
help engage as external rotators and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.180 
help engage as external rotators and
this<00:01:32.960> tendon<00:01:33.320> true<00:01:33.470> position<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.979> going<00:01:34.130> to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
this tendon true position is going to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.490 
this tendon true position is going to
work<00:01:34.399> on<00:01:34.610> not<00:01:34.790> only<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.119> upper<00:01:35.479> traps<00:01:35.780> but<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
work on not only the upper traps but the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.170 
work on not only the upper traps but the
lower<00:01:36.649> traps<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:37.580> he's<00:01:37.700> gonna<00:01:37.790> go<00:01:37.970> through<00:01:38.119> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
lower traps so he's gonna go through a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.389 
lower traps so he's gonna go through a
real<00:01:38.390> short<00:01:38.780> range<00:01:39.110> down<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.159> little<00:01:40.190> bit

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
real short range down just a little bit

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.359 
real short range down just a little bit
elbows<00:01:41.090> locked<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.750> up<00:01:42.289> now<00:01:42.740> again<00:01:43.009> keep<00:01:43.250> in

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
elbows locked and up now again keep in

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.400 
elbows locked and up now again keep in
mind<00:01:43.399> Stevie's<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.000> big<00:01:44.360> stiff<00:01:44.750> power<00:01:44.990> lifter

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
mind Stevie's a big stiff power lifter

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.469 
mind Stevie's a big stiff power lifter
so<00:01:45.740> your<00:01:46.429> performance<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.030> probably<00:01:47.300> going<00:01:47.420> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
so your performance is probably going to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.419 
so your performance is probably going to
look<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.780> little<00:01:47.899> bit<00:01:48.140> different<00:01:48.470> than<00:01:48.619> his<00:01:48.770> but

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
look a little bit different than his but

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.950 
look a little bit different than his but
all<00:01:49.550> you're<00:01:49.700> going<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.850> do<00:01:50.000> perform<00:01:50.450> 8<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.780> 10

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
all you're going to do perform 8 to 10

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.200
