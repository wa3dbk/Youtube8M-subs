00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.369
 welcome this is cooking step to 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.490
 step and today I'm going to show you how to prepare 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.220
 an octopus salad a salad very 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.950
 rich very easy very cool now for the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.750
 summer is starting the warmth those 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.969
 are the ingredients that I will use 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.149
 and the first thing to do is 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.920
 cooking the octopus in boiling water yes 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.770
 but you do not have to put it directly 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.030
 but you have to put it two seconds 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.340
 take it out another two seconds and take it out and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.250
 so repeat this procedure some 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.620
 four times and then later if you can 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.110
 put the octopus in the water that is cooked 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.530
 the cooking time will be 30 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 minutes is to say half an hour to a 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 hour according to the size and weight you have 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 and this to put it on and take it out because 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.909
 we do that because if we do not 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.400
 directly in the boiling water it goes 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.350
 to break the octopus skin and good is going to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.549
 stay 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.549
 so you have to do it this way 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.980
 Once you've spent time 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.100
 cooking like a tiny octopus with 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.170
 40 minutes reached 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.030
 you have to take it out of the water let it stretch 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.939
 a little and with a glass we will put the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.939
 octopus head inside the glass 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.590
 and we'll let it be written in a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.590
 plate 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.549
 and while it cools I 'll go cutting 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.250
 all the ingredients of the salad 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.250
 about 4 cloves of garlic 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.900
 tomato 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 and a good body if it's big can be 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 up to 2 kilos 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.429
 You can reach them to do other 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.250

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.840
 me with this octopus and octopus salad and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.939
 in fault to the Galician that I will leave them the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.900
 link up here if you want to see the 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.900
 Galician octopus recipe 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
 to cut the green pepper I eat 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.989
 I'm always using green pepper 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.989
 Italian 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 that are smaller and tastier 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.720
 parsley 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.830
 so for this recipe it is convenient to use 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.830
 fresh parsley 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.540
 the same with garlic under 100 teeth of 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.540
 Garlic 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.350
 and once you have cut all the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:04.110
 ingredients you have to cut the octopus yes 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.000
 first separate all the tentacles with 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.180
 a scissors or with a knife cutting 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.049
 well up the middle of octopus 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.049
 one by one 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.040
 and so then cut into slices 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.040
 one centimeter thick 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.269
 to add to the salad 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.390
 and now we already have all the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.350
 ready ingredients in a large bowl 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.920

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.640
 and then the different ingredients 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640
