of things in your bag with this bag it
tends<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.040> -<00:03:10.220> when<00:03:10.520> you<00:03:10.610> carry<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.970> with<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
tends to - when you carry it with the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.680 
tends to - when you carry it with the
straps

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
straps

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.460 
straps
it<00:03:12.140> tends<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.650> Sag<00:03:13.310> down<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.880> this<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.320> was

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it tends to Sag down like this and I was

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.940 
it tends to Sag down like this and I was
afraid<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.480> did<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.320> much<00:03:18.590> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
afraid that if it did that so much it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.060 
afraid that if it did that so much it
would<00:03:19.130> leave<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.960> mark<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.860> leather

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
would leave like a mark in the leather

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.120 
would leave like a mark in the leather
so<00:03:22.580> when<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.270> got<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.780> side<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.350> decided<00:03:24.800> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
so when I got this side I decided to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.520 
so when I got this side I decided to
leave<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.580> stuffing<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.989> base<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
leave the stuffing on the base of the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.260 
leave the stuffing on the base of the
bag<00:03:27.709> on<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.100> bottom<00:03:28.459> which<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.670> right<00:03:29.239> there

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
bag on the bottom which is right there

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.380 
bag on the bottom which is right there
the<00:03:29.930> stuffing<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.920> give<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.190> some<00:03:31.400> support<00:03:31.580> so

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the stuffing to give it some support so

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.100 
the stuffing to give it some support so
and<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.160> makes<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.459> big<00:03:34.670> difference

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
and I just that makes a big difference

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.190 
and I just that makes a big difference
so<00:03:36.110> now<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.530> when<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:36.920> carry<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.730> just

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
so now that when I carry it it just

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.830 
so now that when I carry it it just
stays<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.440> place<00:03:39.910> instead<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:40.970> sagging<00:03:41.630> down

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
stays in place instead of sagging down

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.860 
stays in place instead of sagging down
like<00:03:42.050> that

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
like that

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.080
