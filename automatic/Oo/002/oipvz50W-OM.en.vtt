00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.240
 Hello everyone , welcome to this new one 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.980
 tutorial video smog 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.650
 I'm going to show you a lot today 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.930
 very important especially for i 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.289
 fourth touch ipod owners 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.480
 generation iphone 4 iphone 3gs ie 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.599
 the untethered jailbreak for these 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.790
 devices that I listed then how 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.040
 see there is no computer 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.680
 in the image there is only my ipod 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.500
 touch this because to perform this 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.450
 jailbreak you will not need the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.340
 computer a little better than the computer you will have it 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.560
 need to jailbreak seeds 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.430
 preview to follow this life this 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.020
 guide 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.870
 if you haven't done the jailbreak seeds 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.730
 tethered click on the link that will put 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.560
 in description so you will jailbreak 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.050
 semi hunter and you can follow this 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.510
 drive well so as I just said 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.420
 need the semi tethered jailbreak 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.190
 at this point we unlock ours 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.770
 device 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.350
 let's go to cydia look for posix pon with p 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.880
 10 and you will find exactly how you see the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.009
 posix pon package 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.829
 I had installed it from the net 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.380
 private of the highgate hacker no but 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:22.749
 now it has become available in the rep 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.240
 standard of dissidia so you won't have to 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.670
 do nothing but install this 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.990
 package is once done you will have to 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.659
 restart your device 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.850
 manually then siria will give you returns 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.310
 yes you will have to restart it 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 manually having precisely the jazz and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.569
 nothing the red would think you should do 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.779
 a tethered boot 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.310
 but no it has become ante 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:47.310
 road will just turn off and on again 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 perfect the ipod touch has shut down now 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:00.670
 we turn on not cut the video so you 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.229
 you can actually see that hunt 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.840
 ether of my device you are 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.259
 lighting by itself without the use of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.030
 computer and then if I had to do a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.530
 boot tethered there would be pineapple instead 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 of the apple 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 we await a few more seconds 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.900
 let's hold on a moment 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.360
 here the device is turned on again 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.099
 as you can see there is this little bug that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.670
 as soon as it is turned on the lockscreen appears 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.390
 and disappears immediately but has nothing 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.890
 you can device works anyway 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.709
 how perfectly all 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.510
 cydia tweaks work and center 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.660
 still ensi transparency notifications 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.430
 settings and I have not used the computer yes 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.230
 it is theory via normal with jailbreak 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.989
 sawing ter does not open there 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.730
 jailbreak applications but now me 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.989
 to show you that I'm going to ante tele 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.890
 to open a case for example 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.360
 activator here with us you have activator 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.099
 is open and works perfectly 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.200
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.739
 soon I will also make a video on how 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.829
 untethered ios jailbreak 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.470
 7 is a fairly simple thing if 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:30.190
 you have made a one vision jailbreak of 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.739
 ios 76.06 point 1.2 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.660
 the procedure is the same on s7 then 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.450
 you will connect the device to the computer 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.060
 you can start the program then you will have to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.290
 press on the icon and then a 7 that 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.910
 will appear in the home and everything will be done 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.280
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.639
 as you can see, the bottle itself is 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.410
 normally started no problem 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:58.870
 it works very well and that's all for today 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.269
