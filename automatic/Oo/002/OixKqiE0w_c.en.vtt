 little by little, let's go with project 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.840
 spartan the new browser that will come 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 with windows 10 although it was very little 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.060
 of him some did not leave them very 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.490
 convinced but microsoft has mentioned 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.130
 that we will still take a few months 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.290
 see this full browser between 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 He has shown some things that are 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.300
 find cortana that will be totally 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.150
 integrated into the browser we can take 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.700
 notes in this and share them with friends 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.550
 the address bar will be an element 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.640
 very important and we will also have 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.800
 a reading mode thanks to this mode the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 browser will become a kind 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.570
 of sheet of paper on which only 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.970
 we will have to devote ourselves to reading and in case 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.310
 not enough reading mode 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.740
 will allow us to save pages for 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 create them later logically in the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.510
 device that we want microsoft is 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.660
 betting on a single operating system 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.230
 for all platforms like 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.020
 the so-called windows phone tablets pc or 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.930
 xbox aesthetically the main screen 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.750
 of the mobile look like the change 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.460
 it arrives when we go to the menu on the right 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 now instead of showing us a 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.540
 endless list of applications 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.060
 we can see at the beginning of everything 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 most used apps what will be much more 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.800
 comfortable when using the phone and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.530
 it saves us time here comes what we 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.380
 it interests the players of xbox because 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.140
 the xbox one app has been announced for 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.450
 windows 10 thanks to her we can 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.180
 access a lot of information from the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.880
 console and from your friends there seems to be 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.640
 an xbox live system that unites the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.470
 users of pc and xbox although it has not been 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.320
 spoken nothing of playing between platforms 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 there has also been talk of direct 12 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.940
 thanks to which the developers 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.210
 they have much more control over the gpu and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.700
 the CPU getting 50% more than 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.770
 performance in the applications also 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.500
 you can record the last seconds of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.260
 steam game as now with xbox one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.599
 But that is not all 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.970
 is that windows 10 will come with a 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.129
 functionality of which microsoft already 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.040
 had ever spoken the game in 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.590
 streaming thanks to this we can play 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.409
 from our surface on xbox one without 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.079
 be in front of the console that yes this 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.849
