 hello everyone this video is in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.340
 collaboration with elisa and we interpret 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.500
 of one piece characters 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 I chose to interpret one of the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.120
 main antagonists of the saga of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.949
 punk hazard ie caesar clown the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.100
 master elisa instead decided to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.580
 interpret monet the beautiful harpy 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.250
 with green hair and amber eyes has 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 created this beautiful trick with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 these artistic and dramatic eyes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 my makeup is based instead 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.680
 mainly on this false mouth 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.110
 drawn on my closed mouth 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.730
 I made this choice because this 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.730
 character is often open-mouthed 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.280
 now if you are interested follow the tutorial 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.280
 thank you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.360
 first of all colored almost the whole 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.380
 face with this white paste that I have 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:16.659
 taken data cota is a face color 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:20.229
 obviously then it changes the contours a little 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.100
 of the face to give it a little more shape 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.649
 resembling that of the character e 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.170
 conceal the extra part by coloring it by 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.060
 niro musotto this black gel eyeliner 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 because then it dries up and so after i 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.369
 hair does not get dirty when there 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.819
 however the shape of the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.819
 mouth 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.000
 with this little brush that is a 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.000
 brush from grain nail art 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.789
 I gave him a little thickness for the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.789
 lip 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.960
 then filled it with a long lasting one 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.700
 purple khad eyeshadow stick then I have 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.700
 always made the outline with the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.840
 Nail art brush is an eyeliner in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.670
 gel I did a little shading 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 under the lip 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:50.390
 then i do this with touring to give al 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.390
 nose a thin square shape 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.870
 I'm using a continuous black kiko mat 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.159
 always with this sort of contouring 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 in the eyes 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:24.670
 I make the eye contour with a liner 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.329
 a bit coarse just like the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.329
 character 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.459
 all these false folds blurring one 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:53.840
 even just face to give this 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.840
 wrinkled expression 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.860
 I make some nuances 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.440
 now the fun part 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:47.270
 the teeth the mouth with the tongue 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:51.080
 now I make the two rows of teeth then 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.500
 i make this house is beautiful language that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.500
 escapes 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.180
 those of fano speak only red lipstick 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.180
 and this lip brush 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.270
 soon I will go to create some 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.890
 shading to make the tongue look like 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.890
 in three-dimensional 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.890
 first fixed it since it was lipstick 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.690
 with a color that I was not just one 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.930
 species of fuchs and in order to change them 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.820
 even slightly the color I did there 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.940
 a white shade and now I am 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.450
 doing black to make sense of 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.450
 depth 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.320
 here too, of course, I fill with black 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.450
 because part of the oral cavity is fifth 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.900
 the white one because then from there we'll get the 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.900
 teeth 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.520
 and now precisely there we had to do the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.069
 silhouettes of the defeated which is the most thing 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.990
 important 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:00.120
 a bit of shading bridge for 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.120
 pretend a little three-dimensional 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:11.860
 we fade is practically the way it is done now 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.479
 I send a kiss to everyone and thanks to mine 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.479
 collaborator and lisa ciao
