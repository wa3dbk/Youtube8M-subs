daylight sensors know you think that
must<00:00:25.060> be<00:00:25.210> weird<00:00:25.360> because<00:00:25.630> obviously<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.470> look

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680

daylight sensors are taking in the sun
wherever<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.910> heck<00:00:31.030> it<00:00:31.150> is<00:00:31.180> somewhere<00:00:31.600> over

was the melon thing i was working on

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.390 
was the melon thing i was working on
before<00:00:40.330> it's<00:00:41.140> my<00:00:41.290> redstone<00:00:41.500> testing<00:00:42.070> area<00:00:42.340> i'm

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
before it's my redstone testing area i'm

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.460 
before it's my redstone testing area i'm
currently<00:00:42.580> using<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:43.150> OCD<00:00:43.960> texture<00:00:44.320> pack

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
currently using the OCD texture pack

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.690 
currently using the OCD texture pack
this<00:00:44.650> because<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.890> looks<00:00:45.040> nice<00:00:45.310> and<00:00:45.490> fluffy

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
this because it looks nice and fluffy

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.810 
this because it looks nice and fluffy
but<00:00:46.360> anyway<00:00:46.600> with<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.140> nice<00:00:47.290> simple<00:00:47.560> change<00:00:48.070> you

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
but anyway with a nice simple change you

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.370 
but anyway with a nice simple change you
can<00:00:49.000> make<00:00:49.030> things<00:00:49.480> work<00:00:49.840> just<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.140> little<00:00:50.170> bit

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
can make things work just a little bit

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.700 
can make things work just a little bit
bare<00:00:50.500> face<00:00:50.650> ursula<00:00:51.160> c<00:00:51.640> times<00:00:52.480> set<00:00:52.989> night<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
bare face ursula c times set night and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.750 
bare face ursula c times set night and
we'll<00:00:56.829> just<00:00:56.980> wait<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.160> few<00:00:57.190> seconds<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.610> tell

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
we'll just wait a few seconds of tell

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.690 
we'll just wait a few seconds of tell
the<00:00:57.850> night<00:00:58.060> actually<00:00:58.420> comes<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.980> we<00:01:00.040> go<00:01:00.220> as

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
the night actually comes there we go as

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.360 
the night actually comes there we go as
you<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.090> moody<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.390> now<00:01:01.510> rising<00:01:01.810> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you see the moody is now rising and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.950 
you see the moody is now rising and
since<00:01:03.370> we've<00:01:03.520> got<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.000> basically<00:01:04.600> reverse

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
since we've got it to basically reverse

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.320 
since we've got it to basically reverse
this<00:01:05.170> signal<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.740> now<00:01:05.890> thinks<00:01:06.190> days<00:01:06.430> 1990s<00:01:07.150> day

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
this signal it now thinks days 1990s day

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.140 
this signal it now thinks days 1990s day
which<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.740> backwards<00:01:08.740> as<00:01:08.860> all<00:01:08.979> heck<00:01:09.220> but<00:01:09.580> now

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
which is backwards as all heck but now

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.870 
which is backwards as all heck but now
at<00:01:10.450> nighttime<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.290> have<00:01:11.409> stuff<00:01:11.650> lit<00:01:11.800> up<00:01:11.920> now

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
at nighttime we have stuff lit up now

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.460 
at nighttime we have stuff lit up now
the<00:01:12.940> huge<00:01:13.300> benefit<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.110> obviously<00:01:14.260> if

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
the huge benefit of this is obviously if

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
the huge benefit of this is obviously if
you're<00:01:14.560> doing<00:01:14.770> like<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.920> survival<00:01:15.310> let's

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
you're doing like a survival let's

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you're doing like a survival let's
player<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.820> have<00:01:15.850> these<00:01:16.060> materials

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
player you have these materials

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.660 
player you have these materials
available<00:01:16.659> which<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.110> mean<00:01:17.310> redstone<00:01:18.310> lamps

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
available which you mean redstone lamps

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.399 
available which you mean redstone lamps
and<00:01:18.970> everything<00:01:19.479> else<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.750> pretty<00:01:20.020> easy<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
and everything else is pretty easy to

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.469 
and everything else is pretty easy to
come<00:01:20.590> by<00:01:20.620> realistically<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.330> have<00:01:22.450> all

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
come by realistically you can have all

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.420 
come by realistically you can have all
your<00:01:22.750> stuff<00:01:22.810> little<00:01:23.229> pretty<00:01:23.860> cool<00:01:24.100> at<00:01:24.280> night

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
your stuff little pretty cool at night

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.590 
your stuff little pretty cool at night
so<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:24.880> don't<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.150> constantly<00:01:25.330> put

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
so you don't have to constantly put

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480 
so you don't have to constantly put

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.800 
torches down off we're about having
torches<00:01:27.820> lying<00:01:28.000> around<00:01:28.180> at<00:01:28.330> night<00:01:28.360> i<00:01:28.690> love

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
those and OCD but anyway all we have

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.420 
those and OCD but anyway all we have
here<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.470> daylight<00:01:32.740> sensor<00:01:33.070> just<00:01:33.280> like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
here is the daylight sensor just like

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.730 
here is the daylight sensor just like
this<00:01:33.790> cut<00:01:34.299> set<00:01:34.510> up<00:01:34.600> over<00:01:34.780> there<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.619> then<00:01:35.710> it

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
this cut set up over there and then it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.680 
this cut set up over there and then it
feeds<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.130> through<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:36.940> super<00:01:37.330> simple

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
feeds it through to the super simple

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.859 
feeds it through to the super simple
redstone<00:01:38.320> basically<00:01:39.190> soap<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:40.479> i'll<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:40.630> get

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
redstone basically soap so i'll just get

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.320 
redstone basically soap so i'll just get
rid<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.020> all<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.260> dirt<00:01:41.650> i<00:01:41.950> use<00:01:42.640> diamonds<00:01:43.180> just

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
rid of all this dirt i use diamonds just

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.789 
rid of all this dirt i use diamonds just
to<00:01:43.450> show<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.750> separation<00:01:44.260> blocks<00:01:44.470> instead<00:01:44.619> of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
to show the separation blocks instead of

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.010 
to show the separation blocks instead of
stone<00:01:45.100> over<00:01:45.340> there<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> can<00:01:46.930> use

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
stone over there but you can use

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.149 
stone over there but you can use
basically<00:01:47.350> whatever<00:01:47.560> as<00:01:47.770> long<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.040> not

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
basically whatever as long as it's not

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.399 
basically whatever as long as it's not
like<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> redstone<00:01:48.729> block<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.840> there<00:01:53.020> we<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:53.110> and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
like a redstone block so there we go and

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.510 
like a redstone block so there we go and
then<00:01:53.500> these<00:01:53.590> feeds<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.100> way<00:01:54.189> down<00:01:54.340> there

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
then these feeds all the way down there

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.030 
then these feeds all the way down there
as<00:01:54.610> well<00:01:54.760> so<00:01:55.110> i<00:01:56.110> was<00:01:56.439> for<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.650> nice<00:01:56.860> little

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
as well so i was for this nice little

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.920 
as well so i was for this nice little
house<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.549> built<00:01:57.820> its<00:01:58.360> protected<00:01:58.780> during

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
house that built its protected during

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.060 
house that built its protected during
the<00:01:59.049> night<00:01:59.200> because<00:01:59.439> obviously<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.890> lights

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the night because obviously the lights

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.920 
the night because obviously the lights
come<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.610> you're<00:02:01.479> not<00:02:01.540> going<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.750> bob

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
come on so you're not going to bob

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.850 
come on so you're not going to bob
spawning<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.380> stuff<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:02.680> because

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
spawning and stuff like that because

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.310 
spawning and stuff like that because
it's<00:02:03.189> it's<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:04.689> better<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.229> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
it's it's it's just better you can do it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.749 
it's it's it's just better you can do it
still<00:02:05.470> like<00:02:05.680> your<00:02:05.770> path<00:02:06.009> ways<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.580> do<00:02:06.670> it

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
still like your path ways you can do it

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.119 
still like your path ways you can do it
to<00:02:06.820> basically<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:08.049> pretty<00:02:08.319> fly<00:02:08.469> an<00:02:08.619> area<00:02:08.919> and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
to basically it's pretty fly an area and

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.889 
to basically it's pretty fly an area and
its<00:02:09.249> really<00:02:09.519> simple<00:02:09.759> like<00:02:10.389> i'll<00:02:10.539> show<00:02:10.689> you<00:02:10.749> how

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
its really simple like i'll show you how

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.209 
its really simple like i'll show you how
to<00:02:10.959> reverse<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> signal<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.829> case<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.069> is

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
to reverse a signal just in case this is

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.500 
to reverse a signal just in case this is
an<00:02:12.340> obvious

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
an obvious

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.440 
an obvious
so<00:02:13.780> we'll<00:02:14.019> grab<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.439> will<00:02:14.680> grab<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so we'll grab that will grab that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.899 
so we'll grab that will grab that
obviously<00:02:16.450> normal<00:02:17.019> redstone<00:02:17.909> nothing

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
obviously normal redstone nothing

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.270 
obviously normal redstone nothing
happens<00:02:19.269> because<00:02:19.540> obviously<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:20.019> nighttime

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
happens because obviously it's nighttime

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.350 
happens because obviously it's nighttime
so<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.579> do<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.879> put<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> stone

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
so all you have to do is put a stone

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.119 
so all you have to do is put a stone
down<00:02:22.629> remove<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.290> piece<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.590> redstone<00:02:23.709> there

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
down remove that piece of redstone there

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.280 
down remove that piece of redstone there
and<00:02:24.579> it<00:02:25.390> reverses<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.840> signal<00:02:26.140> because

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and it reverses the signal because

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.380 
and it reverses the signal because
obviously<00:02:26.379> that's<00:02:26.799> telling<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.400> go<00:02:27.579> on<00:02:27.610> but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
obviously that's telling it to go on but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.910 
obviously that's telling it to go on but
soon<00:02:28.540> as<00:02:28.659> this<00:02:28.780> goes<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.200> it'll<00:02:29.560> tell<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.890> go

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
soon as this goes on it'll tell it to go

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.280 
soon as this goes on it'll tell it to go
off<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.000> repeats<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.450> signal<00:02:31.780> its<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.230> of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
off so it repeats the signal its kind of

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.390 
off so it repeats the signal its kind of
backwards<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.739> got<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.159> literally

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
backwards but I got to do is literally

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.399 
backwards but I got to do is literally
do<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> like<00:02:34.299> I've<00:02:34.480> done<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.720> here<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.079> doesn't

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
do it like I've done it here it doesn't

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.330 
do it like I've done it here it doesn't
matter<00:02:35.470> if<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> don't<00:02:35.799> understand<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.250> as

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
matter if you don't understand it as

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.440 
matter if you don't understand it as
long<00:02:36.430> as<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.579> do<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.879> I've<00:02:37.000> done<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.209> here

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
long as you do it like I've done it here

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.990 
long as you do it like I've done it here
it<00:02:37.810> will<00:02:38.049> work<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:39.519> can<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:39.940> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it will work you can do this you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.580 
it will work you can do this you
obviously<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.540> doors<00:02:40.840> are<00:02:41.049> only<00:02:41.200> open<00:02:41.379> at

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
obviously have doors are only open at

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.050 
obviously have doors are only open at
night<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.099> an<00:02:42.190> adventure<00:02:42.640> map<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.939> do

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
night if you do an adventure map you do

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.520 
night if you do an adventure map you do
it<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> whole<00:02:43.420> host<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.959> other<00:02:44.109> stuff<00:02:44.319> but<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
it for a whole host of other stuff but I

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.809 
it for a whole host of other stuff but I
just<00:02:44.709> like<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:44.950> idea<00:02:45.159> of<00:02:45.220> having<00:02:45.310> stuff<00:02:45.640> lit

there'll be more redstone tutorials

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.899 
there'll be more redstone tutorials
coming<00:03:14.440> probably<00:03:15.099> within<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.430> week<00:03:15.579> soon<00:03:15.790> as
