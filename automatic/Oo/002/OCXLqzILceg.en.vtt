so they really like that and then over

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.360 
so they really like that and then over
here<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.049> just<00:04:20.169> had<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.560> bend<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.070> grids

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
here I just had to bend the grids

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.510 
here I just had to bend the grids
actually

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
actually

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.309 
actually
my<00:04:22.940> friend<00:04:23.509> did<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.720> because<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.960> do<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.169> have

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
my friend did that because I do not have

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.779 
my friend did that because I do not have
the<00:04:24.500> strength<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.860> do<00:04:24.979> that<00:04:25.009> and<00:04:25.550> then<00:04:25.669> over

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
the strength to do that and then over

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.430 
the strength to do that and then over
there<00:04:25.940> had<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.210> cut<00:04:26.419> one<00:04:26.599> so<00:04:26.930> that's<00:04:27.080> kind<00:04:27.379> of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there had to cut one so that's kind of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.999 
there had to cut one so that's kind of
why<00:04:28.370> it's<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.729> because<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.870> wasn't<00:04:30.710> it

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
why it's like that because it wasn't it

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.279 
why it's like that because it wasn't it
didn't<00:04:31.280> work<00:04:31.400> out<00:04:31.550> with<00:04:31.759> straight<00:04:32.180> grids<00:04:32.449> so

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
didn't work out with straight grids so

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.570 
didn't work out with straight grids so
yeah<00:04:33.560> that<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:33.830> actually<00:04:34.159> pretty<00:04:34.280> much<00:04:34.430> their

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
yeah that is actually pretty much their

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.339 
yeah that is actually pretty much their
cage<00:04:34.729> it's<00:04:35.000> certainly<00:04:35.270> out<00:04:35.539> that<00:04:35.870> interesting

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
cage it's certainly out that interesting

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.520 
cage it's certainly out that interesting
but<00:04:37.120> whatever<00:04:38.120> they<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.539> it<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:39.319> it<00:04:39.349> much

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
but whatever they like it like it much

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.529 
but whatever they like it like it much
better<00:04:39.560> than<00:04:39.770> their<00:04:39.949> other<00:04:39.979> cage<00:04:40.370> so<00:04:41.330> yeah

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
better than their other cage so yeah

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.450 
better than their other cage so yeah
that<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.960> raining<00:04:42.379> off<00:04:42.500> his<00:04:42.620> cage<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.099> you<00:04:43.190> and
