00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
second position I play with my index

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.099 
second position I play with my index
finger<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.640> fifth<00:00:48.879> position<00:00:49.329> I<00:00:49.510> play<00:00:49.809> with<00:00:50.050> my

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
finger the fifth position I play with my

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.680 

this<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.170> all<00:03:21.160> repeated<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.940> couple<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.390> times

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
this is all repeated a couple of times

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.640 
this is all repeated a couple of times
and<00:03:26.250> after<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.850> go<00:03:27.880> into<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:29.350> another

and after that you go into to another

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.740 
and after that you go into to another
course<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> first<00:03:31.240> should<00:03:31.450> sound<00:03:31.630> like

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
course so the first should sound like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.390 
course so the first should sound like
this<00:03:32.050> three<00:03:32.970> four<00:03:33.970> and
