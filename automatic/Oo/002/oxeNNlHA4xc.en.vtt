our<00:00:00.420> perception<00:00:00.930> of<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.140> world<00:00:01.290> around<00:00:01.530> us<00:00:01.860> is

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
our perception of the world around us is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.280 
our perception of the world around us is
strongly<00:00:02.460> linked<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:03.000> our<00:00:03.090> vision<00:00:03.540> but<00:00:03.870> how<00:00:04.230> do

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
strongly linked to our vision but how do

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.260 
strongly linked to our vision but how do
you<00:00:04.440> know<00:00:04.560> what<00:00:04.680> you're<00:00:04.799> seeing<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.339> real<00:00:05.640> can

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
you know what you're seeing is real can

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.270 
you know what you're seeing is real can
you<00:00:06.359> really<00:00:06.540> trust<00:00:06.839> your<00:00:07.230> eyes<00:00:07.410> take<00:00:08.099> for

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
you really trust your eyes take for

examples<00:00:31.460> examine<00:00:32.460> them<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.640> Photoshop<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
examples examine them in Photoshop and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.670 
examples examine them in Photoshop and
you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> colors<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
you can see that the colors are the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.580 
you can see that the colors are the
exact<00:00:35.219> same<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:36.030> similar<00:00:36.660> effect<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.320> seen

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
exact same a similar effect can be seen

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
exact same a similar effect can be seen
with<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.040> checkerboard<00:00:38.579> illusion<00:00:39.300> tile<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with this checkerboard illusion tile a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
with this checkerboard illusion tile a
clearly<00:00:40.620> seems<00:00:40.860> darker<00:00:41.280> than<00:00:41.399> tile<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.969> but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
clearly seems darker than tile be but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
clearly seems darker than tile be but
you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:43.020> better<00:00:43.140> by<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.829> even<00:00:44.520> though

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you know better by now right even though

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
you know better by now right even though
your<00:00:44.760> eyes<00:00:44.910> can't<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
your eyes can't see it you know when I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
your eyes can't see it you know when I
remove<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> surrounding<00:00:47.579> imagery<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.360> tiles

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
remove the surrounding imagery the tiles

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260 
remove the surrounding imagery the tiles
will<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> same<00:00:49.469> color<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.489> what's<00:00:51.000> going

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
will be the same color so what's going

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
will be the same color so what's going
on<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.140> truth<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> scientists

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
on here the truth is that scientists

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.709 
on here the truth is that scientists
don't<00:00:53.520> fully<00:00:53.640> understand<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.539> phenomenon

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
don't fully understand this phenomenon

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
don't fully understand this phenomenon
and<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.680> many<00:00:55.739> complex<00:00:56.430> biological

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and there are many complex biological

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
and there are many complex biological
and<00:00:57.420> neurological<00:00:58.020> factors<00:00:58.410> taking<00:00:58.770> place

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and neurological factors taking place

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
and neurological factors taking place
ultimately<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.180> brains<00:01:00.510> judge<00:01:00.809> color<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ultimately our brains judge color and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
ultimately our brains judge color and
brightness<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.949> context<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.420> words<00:01:03.660> our

brightness in context in other words our

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
brightness in context in other words our
brains<00:01:04.170> compare<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> surrounding

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
brains compare the surrounding

brains compare the surrounding

phenomenon our brains know that shadows

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
phenomenon our brains know that shadows

make objects look darker as a result the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
make objects look darker as a result the
brain<00:01:28.619> compensates<00:01:29.070> by<00:01:29.460> interpreting<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
brain compensates by interpreting the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
brain compensates by interpreting the
tile<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.630> being<00:01:30.900> lighter<00:01:31.229> than<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.590> appears

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
tile as being lighter than it appears

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580 
tile as being lighter than it appears
until<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.970> take<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> shadow<00:01:33.509> away<00:01:33.990> perhaps

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
until we take the shadow away perhaps

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
until we take the shadow away perhaps
the<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:34.979> blatant<00:01:35.430> example<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the most blatant example is this

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
the most blatant example is this
gradient<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.259> middle<00:01:37.500> bar<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.950> simply<00:01:38.460> one

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
gradient the middle bar is simply one

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.969 
gradient the middle bar is simply one
color<00:01:39.150> remove<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> background<00:01:40.229> gradient<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
color remove the background gradient and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
color remove the background gradient and
it<00:01:41.130> becomes<00:01:41.430> obvious<00:01:41.759> once<00:01:42.570> again<00:01:42.869> the
