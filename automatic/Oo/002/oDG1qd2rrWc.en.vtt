back on you
to<00:05:43.030> be<00:05:43.150> loose<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.900> you<00:05:43.990> can<00:05:44.170> get<00:05:44.380> good<00:05:44.770> airflow

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
to be loose so you can get good airflow

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.970 
to be loose so you can get good airflow

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
place I do not do that because that

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.020

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
which is the next step that is going to

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.820 
which is the next step that is going to
get<00:06:00.820> rice<00:06:01.060> all<00:06:01.360> over<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.140> place<00:06:02.350> in<00:06:02.530> here<00:06:02.710> if

when<00:06:33.430> I<00:06:33.490> turned<00:06:33.820> on<00:06:33.940> my<00:06:34.120> phone<00:06:34.420> I<00:06:34.690> plugged<00:06:35.080> it

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
when I turned on my phone I plugged it

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.120 
when I turned on my phone I plugged it
into<00:06:35.380> the<00:06:35.560> computer<00:06:36.280> directly<00:06:37.120> and<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:38.740> came

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
into the computer directly and it came

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.940 
into the computer directly and it came
to<00:06:39.310> life<00:06:39.520> but<00:06:40.120> I<00:06:40.180> could<00:06:40.390> see<00:06:40.660> some<00:06:41.020> water<00:06:41.500> still

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
to life but I could see some water still

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.320 
to life but I could see some water still
kind<00:06:42.160> of<00:06:42.220> squished<00:06:42.520> in<00:06:42.640> between<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:43.030> screen

kind of squished in between the screen

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.360 
kind of squished in between the screen
so<00:06:43.600> I<00:06:43.630> quickly<00:06:43.930> turned<00:06:44.200> it<00:06:44.350> back<00:06:44.470> off<00:06:44.710> and<00:06:45.070> I

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
so I quickly turned it back off and I

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.900 
so I quickly turned it back off and I
let<00:06:45.550> it<00:06:45.670> sit<00:06:45.880> for<00:06:45.910> longer<00:06:46.390> or<00:06:47.610> what<00:06:48.610> I'm<00:06:48.730> going

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910
