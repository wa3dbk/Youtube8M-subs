saw we use a jigsaw the first step is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
saw we use a jigsaw the first step is
going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.960> prep<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> hole<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.980> our<00:00:35.100> fan

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
going to be to prep the hole for our fan

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.090 
going to be to prep the hole for our fan
you<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.480> by<00:00:36.720> laying<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> fan<00:00:37.470> facedown

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you do this by laying the fan facedown

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
you do this by laying the fan facedown
on<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.340> lid<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> cooler<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> tracing<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
on the lid of the cooler and tracing the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
on the lid of the cooler and tracing the
outline<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> sharpie<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:42.030> need<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> make

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
outline with a sharpie you need to make

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
outline with a sharpie you need to make
sure<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:43.079> outline<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> little<00:00:44.219> bit

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
sure that your outline is a little bit

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.490 
sure that your outline is a little bit
smaller<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> fan<00:00:45.239> itself<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.200> create<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
smaller than a fan itself to create a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.889 
smaller than a fan itself to create a
lip<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.129> fan<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> sit<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.790> when<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
lip for the fan to sit on when you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
lip for the fan to sit on when you
it<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.469> glue<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.800> down<00:00:49.980> later<00:00:50.300> once<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it down or glue it down later once you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
it down or glue it down later once you
have<00:00:51.450> your<00:00:51.690> outline<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.980> ahead<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
have your outline you can go ahead and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
have your outline you can go ahead and
start<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.910> hole<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> drill<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
start your hole with the drill then you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
start your hole with the drill then you
take<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.160> saw<00:00:56.520> blade<00:00:56.550> insert<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> into<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
take your saw blade insert it into the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.900 
take your saw blade insert it into the
drill<00:00:58.020> hole<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> cut<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> hole<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.789> your

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
drill hole and cut out the hole for your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:10.459 
drill hole and cut out the hole for your
fan<00:01:08.659> you're<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.259> take<00:01:10.409> your

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
fan you're going to want to take your

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.559 
fan you're going to want to take your
time<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.009> this<00:01:11.159> step<00:01:11.459> because<00:01:12.029> you<00:01:12.179> can<00:01:12.329> always

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
time in this step because you can always

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.739 
time in this step because you can always
go<00:01:12.929> back<00:01:12.959> and<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:14.310> hole<00:01:14.549> bigger<00:01:14.819> but

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
go back and make your hole bigger but

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.120 
go back and make your hole bigger but
it's<00:01:15.869> impossible<00:01:16.139> to<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.950> hole

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's impossible to make your hole

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:29.370 
it's impossible to make your hole
smaller

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.740 

our<00:01:30.380> next<00:01:31.340> step<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.820> repeat<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.540> process

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
our next step is to repeat the process

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.600 
our next step is to repeat the process
you<00:01:33.110> just<00:01:33.140> did<00:01:33.560> prepping<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.190> hole<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
you just did prepping the hole for the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.990 
you just did prepping the hole for the
fan<00:01:34.880> with<00:01:35.540> your<00:01:35.750> PVC<00:01:36.050> elbow<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.100> decide<00:01:37.490> where

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
fan with your PVC elbow so decide where

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.120 
fan with your PVC elbow so decide where
you<00:01:38.150> want<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.660> air<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.080> vented<00:01:39.440> out<00:01:39.560> place

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you want the air to be vented out place

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.490 
you want the air to be vented out place
your<00:01:40.340> PVC<00:01:40.850> elbow<00:01:41.180> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.810> lid<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.170> cooler

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
your PVC elbow on the lid of the cooler

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.980 
your PVC elbow on the lid of the cooler
trace<00:01:43.190> around<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.760> then<00:01:44.180> you'll<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.630> drill

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
trace around it then you'll use a drill

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.930 
trace around it then you'll use a drill
to<00:01:45.020> start<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.530> hole<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.010> cut<00:01:46.490> your<00:01:46.580> hole<00:01:46.760> out

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
to start the hole and cut your hole out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.420 
to start the hole and cut your hole out
with<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> jigsaw<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.619> have<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:48.830> hole<00:01:49.160> saw

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
with the jigsaw if you have a hole saw

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190 
with the jigsaw if you have a hole saw
that<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:50.090> also<00:01:50.390> make<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:50.720> process

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that will also make this process

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.040 
that will also make this process
slightly<00:01:51.440> easier<00:01:54.670> now<00:01:55.670> feed<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.240> first<00:01:56.540> elbow

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
slightly easier now feed the first elbow

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.200 
slightly easier now feed the first elbow
through<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> hole<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.190> take<00:01:58.670> your<00:01:58.820> second

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
through the hole and take your second

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.570 
through the hole and take your second
elbow<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.690> attach<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.890> top<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.399> give

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
elbow and attach to the top to give

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.940 
elbow and attach to the top to give
yourself<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.119> 90-degree<00:02:02.840> turn<00:02:02.869> for<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.619> air<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
yourself a 90-degree turn for the air to
