back<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.859> recording<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.340> died<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.880> me<00:00:33.500> so

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
back the recording just died on me so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
back the recording just died on me so
then<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.399> blade<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.090> open<00:00:36.360> you'll<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.660> able

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
then that blade will open you'll be able

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:48.860 
then that blade will open you'll be able
to<00:00:36.899> hit<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.910> these<00:00:38.910> doors<00:00:39.180> will<00:00:39.329> open<00:00:39.390> up

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440 

now<00:00:49.870> this<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.740> a<00:00:50.770> new<00:00:51.100> physic<00:00:52.060> in<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.270> game

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
now this is a new physic in the game

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.780 
now this is a new physic in the game
where<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.080> bombs<00:00:53.320> aren't<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:53.920> fire<00:00:53.950> so<00:00:54.640> you've

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
where the bombs aren't on fire so you've

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.540 
where the bombs aren't on fire so you've
got<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.000> find<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.330> source<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.720> fire<00:00:56.550> naturally

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
got to find a source of fire naturally

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.240 
got to find a source of fire naturally
there's<00:00:57.760> lava<00:00:58.030> lying<00:00:58.390> around<00:00:58.570> but<00:00:59.040> that's<00:01:00.040> not

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
there's lava lying around but that's not

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.620 
there's lava lying around but that's not
hot<00:01:00.490> enough<00:01:00.520> I<00:01:00.910> guess<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.390> we're<00:01:07.480> going<00:01:07.570> to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
hot enough I guess so we're going to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.180 
hot enough I guess so we're going to
head<00:01:07.810> into<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.110> room<00:01:08.350> here<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.770> guys<00:01:08.980> see

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
head into this room here you guys see

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.860 
head into this room here you guys see
three<00:01:09.550> statues<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.210> hold<00:01:10.450> key<00:01:10.780> blades<00:01:12.870> now

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
three statues that hold key blades now

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.150 
three statues that hold key blades now
what<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.380> got<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.530> do<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.710> you've<00:01:14.800> got<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.980> find

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
what we got to do is you've got to find

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.340 
what we got to do is you've got to find
the<00:01:15.280> three<00:01:15.640> blades<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.660> put<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:16.930> there<00:01:17.110> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
the three blades to put in there and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.359 
the three blades to put in there and
then<00:01:17.560> we'll<00:01:17.680> be<00:01:17.800> able<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.010> head<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.340> the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
then we'll be able to head on to the

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.630 
then we'll be able to head on to the
final<00:01:18.729> boss<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:21.190> about<00:01:23.010> nine<00:01:24.010> videos<00:01:24.460> or

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
final boss so it's about nine videos or

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.010 
final boss so it's about nine videos or
so<00:01:24.790> getting<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.270> last<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.750> blades

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.630 

we're<00:01:29.020> also<00:01:29.110> finishing<00:01:29.979> up<00:01:30.100> getting<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.460> rest

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
we're also finishing up getting the rest

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.200 
we're also finishing up getting the rest
of<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.820> collectibles<00:01:32.940> we<00:01:33.940> are<00:01:34.030> actually

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
leaving this place with no collectibles

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.640 
leaving this place with no collectibles
left<00:01:36.520> behind<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:38.170> won't<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.500> worry

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
left behind so you won't have to worry

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:58.500 
left behind so you won't have to worry
about<00:01:38.710> backtracking<00:01:39.400> here

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.230 

so<00:01:59.080> deal<00:01:59.260> with<00:01:59.290> these<00:01:59.500> guys<00:01:59.560> fairly<00:02:00.240> quickly

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
so deal with these guys fairly quickly

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.450 
so deal with these guys fairly quickly
because<00:02:01.660> you're<00:02:01.810> on<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.080> tiny<00:02:02.350> platform<00:02:03.010> so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
because you're on this tiny platform so

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.500 
because you're on this tiny platform so
there's<00:02:03.610> really<00:02:03.700> not<00:02:03.880> much<00:02:04.060> room<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.330> run

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
there's really not much room to run

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
there's really not much room to run
around

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.060 

so<00:02:17.600> there's<00:02:17.780> four<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.140> these<00:02:18.380> switches<00:02:18.770> we're

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
so there's four of these switches we're

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.710 
so there's four of these switches we're
going<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.250> hit<00:02:19.430> you're<00:02:20.240> gonna<00:02:20.330> hit<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> first

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
going to hit you're gonna hit the first

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.450 
going to hit you're gonna hit the first
one<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.110> top<00:02:21.440> left<00:02:21.470> corner<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> screen

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
one on the top left corner of the screen

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.270 
one on the top left corner of the screen
then<00:02:22.870> go<00:02:23.870> after<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.260> top<00:02:24.500> right<00:02:24.890> corner<00:02:25.250> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
then go after the top right corner of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.630 
then go after the top right corner of
the<00:02:25.400> screen<00:02:25.870> or<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.020> mini-map<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.530> should<00:02:27.710> say

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.860 

and<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.060> got<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.300> traverse<00:02:32.720> these

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and you just got to traverse these

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.420 
and you just got to traverse these
platforms<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.560> couple<00:02:33.800> more<00:02:33.950> guys<00:02:34.100> are<00:02:34.310> going

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
platforms a couple more guys are going

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.220 
platforms a couple more guys are going
to<00:02:34.490> spawn

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.440 

now<00:02:40.770> when<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.069> shoot<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.520> third<00:02:41.879> one<00:02:42.120> up<00:02:42.270> on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
now when you shoot this third one up on

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.040 
now when you shoot this third one up on
this<00:02:42.599> platform<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:44.330> center<00:02:45.330> platform<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.930> going

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
this platform a center platform is going

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
this platform a center platform is going
to<00:02:46.110> come<00:02:46.290> up<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.069> you're<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.550> get<00:02:47.700> bombs

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the sword in this area so throw it over

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.550 
the sword in this area so throw it over
there<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:01.110> once<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.470> one<00:03:01.680> blows<00:03:01.860> up

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
there and then once that one blows up

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
this cranky and to reset the platform's

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.020 
this cranky and to reset the platform's

same order and it'll raise the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.860 
same order and it'll raise the
platform's<00:04:50.090> up<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.389> you'll<00:04:50.509> be<00:04:50.599> able<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.780> get

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
platform's up so you'll be able to get

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.530 
platform's up so you'll be able to get
back<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.259> center
