when you when you're sanding they are
quite<00:01:59.700> useful<00:02:00.179> but<00:02:00.270> they're<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.569> quite

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
quite useful but they're also quite

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.309 
quite useful but they're also quite
expensive<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.560> places<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.160> do<00:02:02.220> much<00:02:03.319> so

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
expensive from places like to do much so

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.100 
expensive from places like to do much so
what<00:02:04.860> I've<00:02:05.039> done<00:02:05.190> here<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.599> use<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> big

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
what I've done here is you can use a big

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
what I've done here is you can use a big
compass<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.679> you've<00:02:07.830> got<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> big<00:02:08.160> manly<00:02:08.459> sized

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
compass if you've got a big manly sized

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
compass if you've got a big manly sized
compass<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> big<00:02:10.259> manly<00:02:10.440> sized

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
compass I don't have a big manly sized

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.589 
compass I don't have a big manly sized
compass<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.490> need<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:11.849> no

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
compass because I don't need one no

we're<00:02:18.959> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:19.260> today<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:21.260> there

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
we're going to do today is this there

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.589 
we're going to do today is this there
are<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.430> basically<00:02:24.560> five<00:02:25.560> main<00:02:26.599> well

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
are you know basically five main well

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.920 
are you know basically five main well
six<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.530> I've<00:02:28.680> done<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> signal<00:02:29.750> there<00:02:30.750> are

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
six but I've done the signal there are

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.979 
six but I've done the signal there are
like<00:02:31.170> five<00:02:31.500> main<00:02:32.120> radius<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.599> can<00:02:33.780> get

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
like five main radius that you can get

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.600 
like five main radius that you can get
and<00:02:34.819> 7.25<00:02:35.819> which<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.300> more<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.599> vintage<00:02:37.080> fender

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
and 7.25 which is more a vintage fender

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.330 
and 7.25 which is more a vintage fender
9.5<00:02:38.610> which<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> newer<00:02:39.360> funder

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
9.5 which is like a newer funder

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.530 
9.5 which is like a newer funder
Gibson's<00:02:41.340> tend<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.819> either<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.090> 10<00:02:42.360> inch

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
Gibson's tend to be either a 10 inch

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.589 
Gibson's tend to be either a 10 inch
radius<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:43.200> an<00:02:43.590> 11<00:02:43.980> inch<00:02:44.099> radius<00:02:44.599> Ibanez

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
radius or an 11 inch radius Ibanez

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.399 
radius or an 11 inch radius Ibanez
normally<00:02:46.110> around<00:02:46.519> twelve<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.260> like

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
normally around twelve and you know like

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.910 
normally around twelve and you know like
Jackson's<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.010> things<00:02:50.159> like<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.370> seems

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
Jackson's and things like that seems

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.740 
Jackson's and things like that seems
like<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.100> 16<00:02:51.610> or<00:02:51.819> something<00:02:52.000> survivor<00:02:52.900> flat

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
like a 16 or something survivor flat

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.910 
like a 16 or something survivor flat
obviously<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.080> do<00:02:56.260> all<00:02:56.410> those<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.830> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
obviously you can do all those if you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.559 
obviously you can do all those if you
want<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.550> I'm<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.819> going<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.390> do<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
want to but I'm just going to do the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.059 
want to but I'm just going to do the
main<00:02:58.720> ones<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.140> generally<00:02:59.470> tend<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.830> deal

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
main ones that I generally tend to deal

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.760 
main ones that I generally tend to deal
with<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.900> you're<00:03:02.050> going<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.350> bigger

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
with but if you're going to do bigger

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.550 
with but if you're going to do bigger
radius<00:03:03.010> than<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:03.850> obviously<00:03:04.560> stick

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
radius than that then obviously stick

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.360 
radius than that then obviously stick
with<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.420> literally<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
with it and literally all is is the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.410 
with it and literally all is is the
radius<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.480> from<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> central<00:03:11.709> point<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:13.090> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
radius is from a central point out to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.500 
radius is from a central point out to
the<00:03:13.510> edge<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> circle<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.340> 7.25<00:03:16.270> is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
the edge of the circle and so 7.25 is

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.140 
the edge of the circle and so 7.25 is
exactly<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.050> it<00:03:17.140> says<00:03:17.730> from<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.880> center

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
exactly what it says from the center

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.870 
exactly what it says from the center
point<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.690> circle<00:03:20.280> 7.25<00:03:21.280> inches<00:03:21.310> out

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
point of the circle 7.25 inches out

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.760 
point of the circle 7.25 inches out
right<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.780> then<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.020> draw<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.260> arc<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
right and then you draw the arc and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.120 
right and then you draw the arc and
that's<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.340> 10<00:03:25.330> inches<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.720> 9.5<00:03:26.230> inches<00:03:26.680> 11

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's it 10 inches is 9.5 inches 11

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.670 
that's it 10 inches is 9.5 inches 11
inches<00:03:27.340> onwards<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.060> upwards<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.410> that's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
inches onwards and upwards so that's

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.590 
inches onwards and upwards so that's
what<00:03:29.830> I've<00:03:29.950> done<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.580> get<00:03:30.910> yourself<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.239> drawing

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
what I've done so get yourself a drawing

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.390 
what I've done so get yourself a drawing
pin<00:03:31.780> or<00:03:32.019> something<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.650> nice<00:03:32.920> strong<00:03:33.190> piece<00:03:33.370> of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
pin or something a nice strong piece of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.949 
pin or something a nice strong piece of
pasta<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.970> can<00:03:34.120> use<00:03:34.300> your<00:03:34.390> compass<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.930> can

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
pasta you can use your compass you can

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.210 
pasta you can use your compass you can
use<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> piece<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.440> string<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.100> do

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
use a piece of string you can do

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.740 
use a piece of string you can do
whatever<00:03:36.370> all<00:03:36.820> these<00:03:37.030> things<00:03:37.300> were<00:03:37.450> good<00:03:37.600> for

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
whatever all these things were good for

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.830 
whatever all these things were good for
Romans<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.830> good<00:03:38.980> for<00:03:39.160> us<00:03:39.420> I've<00:03:40.420> already

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
Romans so the good for us I've already

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.870 
Romans so the good for us I've already
done<00:03:41.050> them<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.680> show<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.220> don't

done them just to show you you don't
need<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> draw<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.450> entire<00:03:43.810> circle<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:45.220> just

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
need to draw the entire circle you just

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.670 
need to draw the entire circle you just
need<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.610> radius<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.989> as<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.350> can<00:03:47.470> see

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680

here I've gone from here with a little

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.070 
here I've gone from here with a little
hole<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.590> 7.5<00:03:51.340> inches<00:03:51.880> nice<00:03:52.780> sharp

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
that on a piece of plastic that's great

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.300 
that on a piece of plastic that's great
my<00:04:08.110> need<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.380> push<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.709> little<00:04:08.920> bit<00:04:09.040> harder

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
my need to push on a little bit harder

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.150 
my need to push on a little bit harder
if<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.459> do<00:04:09.549> not<00:04:09.670> cardboard<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.329> same<00:04:11.130> what<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
if you do not cardboard the same what I

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.949 
if you do not cardboard the same what I
tend<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.579> do<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:13.000> you're<00:04:13.150> gonna<00:04:13.329> do<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:13.750> on

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
tend to do if you're gonna do this on

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.860 
tend to do if you're gonna do this on
plastic<00:04:14.850> which<00:04:15.850> most<00:04:16.090> people<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.510> think<00:04:16.690> are
