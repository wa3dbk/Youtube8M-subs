don't twitter so you can get status

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.179 
don't twitter so you can get status
updates<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.240> me<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:04.649> did<00:02:04.829> use<00:02:04.979> two

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
updates from me and i did use two

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.560 
updates from me and i did use two
different<00:02:05.219> sizes<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> rollers<00:02:06.240> because

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
different sizes of rollers because

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
different sizes of rollers because
that's<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> add

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that's what I add

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.970 
that's what I add
so<00:02:09.870> that's<00:02:10.870> why<00:02:11.020> i<00:02:11.050> use<00:02:11.230> two<00:02:11.500> different<00:02:11.530> types

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
so that's why i use two different types

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
so that's why i use two different types
and<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.840> I'm<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.110> untwisting

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and you know you see I'm just untwisting

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.640 
and you know you see I'm just untwisting
the<00:02:18.600> trying<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.660> make<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.840> video<00:02:19.990> as<00:02:20.230> fast<00:02:20.470> as

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
the trying to make this video as fast as

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.530 
the trying to make this video as fast as
possible<00:02:20.860> because<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.670> know<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.240> isn't

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
possible because you know this isn't

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.880 
possible because you know this isn't
something<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.810> should<00:02:22.930> take<00:02:23.170> all<00:02:23.380> day<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.620> do

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
something that should take all day to do

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.150 
something that should take all day to do
but<00:02:24.850> at<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> same<00:02:25.300> time<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.830> know<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.040> guys

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
but at the same time and I know you guys

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910 
but at the same time and I know you guys
are<00:02:27.220> trying<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.610> sit<00:02:27.790> here<00:02:27.820> just<00:02:28.570> yeah<00:02:29.050> well

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
are trying to sit here just yeah well

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440 
are trying to sit here just yeah well
actually<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.400> are<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.060> guys<00:02:31.240> think

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
actually you are because you guys think

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
actually you are because you guys think
I'm<00:02:31.540> seconds<00:02:31.900> down<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:33.040> I'm<00:02:33.160> just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
I'm seconds down so you see I'm just

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.540 
I'm seconds down so you see I'm just
twisting<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.000> opposite<00:02:34.690> direction<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
twisting in the opposite direction and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.170 
twisting in the opposite direction and
so<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:36.940> twisted<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.550> clockwise

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
so if you twisted what is that clockwise

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.000 
so if you twisted what is that clockwise
you'll<00:02:40.600> be<00:02:40.750> untwisting<00:02:41.410> counterclockwise

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
you'll be untwisting counterclockwise

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.500 
you'll be untwisting counterclockwise
and<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.190> right<00:02:45.190> now<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:46.090> if<00:02:46.240> I<00:02:46.330> wasn't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and so right now you know if I wasn't

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.960 
and so right now you know if I wasn't
really<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:47.080> anywhere<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.670> could

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
really going anywhere this I could

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.750 
really going anywhere this I could
actually<00:02:49.120> wear<00:02:49.420> my<00:02:49.600> hair<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.200> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
actually wear my hair out like this and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.670 
actually wear my hair out like this and
I<00:02:51.760> used<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.120> shampoo<00:02:52.300> technique<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.470> had

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
I used the shampoo technique that I had

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.300 
I used the shampoo technique that I had
in<00:02:53.800> my<00:02:53.890> last<00:02:54.070> video<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> used

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
in my last video and that's all I used

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.080 
in my last video and that's all I used
on<00:02:57.430> my<00:02:57.550> hair<00:02:57.820> was<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.510> come<00:02:59.260> clean<00:02:59.560> shampoo

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
on my hair was the come clean shampoo

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.020 
on my hair was the come clean shampoo

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the not today conditioner and the the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.770 
the not today conditioner and the the
not<00:03:07.990> today<00:03:08.320> with<00:03:08.770> aloe<00:03:09.040> vera<00:03:09.370> mixture<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.090> so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
not today with aloe vera mixture and so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
not today with aloe vera mixture and so
you<00:03:11.740> know<00:03:11.770> I'll<00:03:11.950> probably<00:03:12.070> do<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.370> video<00:03:13.000> about

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you know I'll probably do a video about

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.500 
you know I'll probably do a video about
that<00:03:14.110> conditioner<00:03:14.850> leave-in<00:03:15.850> conditioner

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that conditioner leave-in conditioner

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.050 
that conditioner leave-in conditioner
mixture<00:03:16.930> soon<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.550> is<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
mixture soon but this is just like a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.740 
mixture soon but this is just like a
blah<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.200> vlog<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.980> guess<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.520> regular<00:03:21.850> vlog<00:03:22.030> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
blah of vlog I guess a regular vlog and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.870 
blah of vlog I guess a regular vlog and
so<00:03:23.020> this<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.260> what<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.440> looks<00:03:23.620> like<00:03:23.800> once<00:03:24.790> I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
so this is what it looks like once I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880 
so this is what it looks like once I
took<00:03:24.940> them<00:03:25.180> apart<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.930> use<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.560> curling

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.280 
took them apart I use the curling
custard<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.459> it's<00:03:27.670> got<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.850> nice<00:03:28.060> pretty<00:03:28.959> strong

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
custard so it's got a nice pretty strong

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.270 
custard so it's got a nice pretty strong
firm<00:03:29.620> hold<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.110> sometimes<00:03:32.950> this

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
firm hold and you know sometimes this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.850

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
look might see a little bit of you know

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.940 
look might see a little bit of you know
from<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> curling<00:04:34.230> custard<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.680> might<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.920> a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
from the curling custard it might be a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.370 
from the curling custard it might be a
little<00:04:35.130> bit<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.400> white<00:04:35.760> flakes<00:04:36.120> from<00:04:36.840> drying

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
little bit of white flakes from drying

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.950 
little bit of white flakes from drying
and<00:04:37.830> it's<00:04:38.460> got<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.880> dry<00:04:39.060> over<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.420> span<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.630> two

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and it's got to dry over to span of two

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.580 
and it's got to dry over to span of two
days<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.590> very<00:04:41.250> very<00:04:41.370> dry<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.140> I'm

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
days so that very very dry and so I'm

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.200 
days so that very very dry and so I'm
probably<00:04:43.830> going<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.190> spray<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.760> lightly

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
probably going to spray this lightly

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.090 
probably going to spray this lightly
with<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> Jane<00:04:46.020> Carter<00:04:46.430> because<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:49.710> actual

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
with the Jane Carter because the actual

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.070 
with the Jane Carter because the actual
hair<00:04:50.340> inside<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.150> twist<00:04:51.390> hasn't<00:04:51.780> at<00:04:51.900> the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
hair inside of the twist hasn't at the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.400 
hair inside of the twist hasn't at the
feel<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:53.060> good<00:04:54.060> leave-in<00:04:54.330> conditioner<00:04:55.140> since

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
feel a good leave-in conditioner since

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.290 
feel a good leave-in conditioner since
the<00:04:55.590> wash<00:04:55.830> two<00:04:56.280> days<00:04:56.460> ago<00:04:56.490> on<00:04:59.330> that<00:05:00.330> apart<00:05:01.190> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
the wash two days ago on that apart and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.530 
the wash two days ago on that apart and
so<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:04.170> far<00:05:04.380> looks<00:05:04.620> cute<00:05:05.150> cute<00:05:06.150> different

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
so so far looks cute cute different

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.160 
so so far looks cute cute different
little<00:05:06.720> look<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:08.720> think<00:05:09.720> I'm<00:05:09.810> just<00:05:09.840> pulling

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
little look I think I'm just pulling

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.520 
little look I think I'm just pulling
apart<00:05:10.350> like<00:05:10.680> one<00:05:10.950> time<00:05:12.560> I'm<00:05:13.560> thinking<00:05:13.890> um<00:05:15.530> you

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
apart like one time I'm thinking um you

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.930 
apart like one time I'm thinking um you
know<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.770> bigger<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.070> want<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.520> get<00:05:17.670> the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
know the bigger I want it to get the

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.700 
know the bigger I want it to get the
more<00:05:18.120> I'll<00:05:18.210> pull<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.480> apart<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:19.440> could<00:05:19.590> also

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
more I'll pull it apart you could also

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.200 
more I'll pull it apart you could also
probably<00:05:19.950> just<00:05:20.280> sleep<00:05:20.460> with<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.820> satin

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
probably just sleep with the satin

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.140 
probably just sleep with the satin
bonnet<00:05:21.720> on<00:05:21.990> we'll<00:05:22.590> see<00:05:22.740> how<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:22.920> feel<00:05:23.280> if<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.910> feel

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
bonnet on we'll see how I feel if I feel

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.810 
bonnet on we'll see how I feel if I feel
like<00:05:24.390> retwisting<00:05:25.110> them<00:05:25.290> or<00:05:25.410> not<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.860> would

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
like retwisting them or not I would

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.370 
like retwisting them or not I would
probably<00:05:26.940> just<00:05:27.270> lightly<00:05:27.570> spritz<00:05:28.050> them<00:05:28.200> with

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
probably just lightly spritz them with

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.680 
probably just lightly spritz them with
the<00:05:28.530> leave-in<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.190> then<00:05:30.000> twist<00:05:30.330> them<00:05:30.480> back

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the leave-in and then twist them back

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.980 
the leave-in and then twist them back
cuz<00:05:31.500> water<00:05:31.770> reactivates<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.520> product<00:05:33.300> so

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
cuz water reactivates the product so

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.510 
cuz water reactivates the product so
that's<00:05:34.170> why<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.290> said<00:05:34.470> I'll<00:05:34.590> lightly<00:05:35.040> miss<00:05:35.280> this

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
that's why I said I'll lightly miss this

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.490 
that's why I said I'll lightly miss this
with<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.030> leave-in<00:05:36.240> conditioner<00:05:36.840> because<00:05:37.020> I

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
with the leave-in conditioner because I

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.210 
with the leave-in conditioner because I
don't<00:05:38.310> want<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.910> uh<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.950> think<00:05:40.950> my<00:05:41.070> own

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
don't want this to uh I think my own

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.630 
don't want this to uh I think my own
individual<00:05:41.760> curls<00:05:42.030> would<00:05:42.240> curl<00:05:42.510> or<00:05:42.810> curl<00:05:43.260> up

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
individual curls would curl or curl up

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.830 
individual curls would curl or curl up
because<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.760> still<00:05:45.090> have<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.300> custard<00:05:45.690> in

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
because I still have the custard in

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.040 
because I still have the custard in
that's<00:05:46.590> my<00:05:46.830> theory<00:05:47.690> sticking<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.380> so

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
that's my theory sticking to it and so

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.990 
that's my theory sticking to it and so
this<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.320> I<00:05:52.530> guess<00:05:52.830> my<00:05:53.130> little<00:05:53.370> look<00:05:53.520> what

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
this is I guess my little look what

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.590 
this is I guess my little look what
happened<00:05:54.360> over<00:05:54.600> here<00:05:55.070> something<00:05:56.070> looks

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
happened over here something looks

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.720 
happened over here something looks
pretty<00:05:57.600> we're<00:05:58.530> not<00:05:58.650> frizzy<00:05:58.890> but<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.610> as

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
pretty we're not frizzy but that as
