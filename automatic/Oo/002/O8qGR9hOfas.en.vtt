00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
price they are really nice trees so you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.109 
price they are really nice trees so you
got<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.439> bigger<00:01:22.740> ones<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:25.880> we<00:01:26.880> had<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
got this bigger ones here then we had a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.010 
got this bigger ones here then we had a
little<00:01:27.390> smaller<00:01:28.170> ones<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.479> it's<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.720> for

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
little smaller ones and it's two for

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020 
little smaller ones and it's two for
example

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.250

cleaning<00:02:08.560> machine<00:02:09.420> sorry<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:11.560> I'm

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
cleaning machine sorry for that but I'm

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.000 
cleaning machine sorry for that but I'm
no<00:02:12.400> good<00:02:12.820> after<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:17.130> also<00:02:18.130> this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
no good after here so also this

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
no good after here so also this
tree<00:02:21.010> took<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> different<00:02:21.850> scientists<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:25.050> hope

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
tree took a different scientists I hope

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.080 
tree took a different scientists I hope
this<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.490> view<00:02:27.760> about<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
this can see a little in view about the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.930 
this can see a little in view about the
trees<00:02:28.510> i'm<00:02:28.780> using<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.250> next<00:02:30.400> days<00:02:30.700> i

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
trees i'm using and in the next days i

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.570 
trees i'm using and in the next days i
will<00:02:31.000> make<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:32.350> or<00:02:32.440> two<00:02:32.590> fours<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.190> aboard

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
will make one or two fours from aboard

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.990 
will make one or two fours from aboard
so<00:02:34.390> stay<00:02:35.200> tuned<00:02:35.410> for<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.890> we<00:02:36.520> see<00:02:36.700> us<00:02:36.820> in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
so stay tuned for that and we see us in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.530 
so stay tuned for that and we see us in
the<00:02:37.060> next<00:02:37.150> video<00:02:37.540> y<00:02:37.750> Alexandra
