00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello youtube friends, this is me 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.130
 lucas melor and today I come with a new 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.900
 video and as is typical of the channel them 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.450
 I bring a new game with few resources 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.150
 and of course taking into account the gameplay 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 and good graphics I can say with certainty 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 that this game meets these two 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.590
 requirements especially the part of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.779
 great gameplay the game puts us in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 the feet of a baby which will have 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.760
 how many chilling problems in your 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.470
 home there will be mainly puzzles and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 we will have to use logic to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 resolve what to do also there will be that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 Pay close attention to objects 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.620
 interact bless since they are elements 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.710
 Central in the game will scare you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 a lot playing yesterday 3 but the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 once you will realize that it is a game 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.810
 fantastic and with a gameplay that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.360
 exceeds the limits of my testicles 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.190
 I personally can say that this 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 game is worth it since it is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.660
 pretty good and most important of 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.060
 everything runs on computers not too much 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.309
 fast or with too much capacity to the 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.220
 time to run videogames I 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.110
 would qualify with a 5 out of 5 what still 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 is better is the fact that being a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.160
 horror game we can play it with 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.190
 friends and send us some good scares 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.640
 between compadres ok I'll leave what's left 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.640
 of the gameplay 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.520
 ok we go to the next link that is 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.380
 in the description of the video we open 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.380
 our preferred browser and we access 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.970
 ok it 's a clean uploaded to fuck fire and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 it weighs 55 megabytes 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.590
 I canceled it because of course I already have it 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.940
 well then we have to extract it 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.280
 once extracted we will have to 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.280
 install it with this sector 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 I canceled it because I already 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.670
 I installed 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.560
 and it's that easy and we'll have this great 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.219
 game ready to play and throw us some 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.739
 jacks I'm saying some scares really cool ok 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:05.409
 my people I guess this is the farewell 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.109
 will be until the next video a great 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.709
 hug says goodbye to his partner lukas
