00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.539
 you do not know that I have ltm look 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.370
 you can see that the network is already here 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.019
 of telcel that just yesterday took the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.029
 update and we will go to 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.770
 step as you have to do it you have to 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.210
 go to adjustments first we already 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.790
 we did and that's why it is already here 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.500
 iphone 5 function and you will get a 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.029
 update that tells you that you have to 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.029
 obviously then update the new 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.189
 version and then what you 're going to do is 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.989
 once the updated it very 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.360
 important is that you have to change the 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.340
 sim that is the nano 5 that brought everything 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.920
 iphone 5 does not work you have to go for the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 version 6.0 and even zinc tells you 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.940
 what is lte and then what are we going to 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.610
 to do is quickly a test of 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.740
 speed because I hold and that's how 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.710
 you know I love to try 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.190
 the applications we are making a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.190
 speed test 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.780
 We can see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 that has just 10 megabytes of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.540
 descent speed and right now we're going to 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.540
 watch 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 alive 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.190
 It varies because I have done this test 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.460
 like three times and then it's varying 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 according to the provider now this network that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 just pulled out just using the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 update for iphone yesterday is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.380
 available in various parts of the city 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 from mexico what is for example the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.750
 countess 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.340
 we are right now in the area of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.110
 polanco is also in santa fe is in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 cuajimalpa are from the center 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.960
 then you will not find him at all 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.730
 sides but yes in some points that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.830
 let's put forward in the note what are you going 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.690
 to see below this video and also what 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.760
 curious is that this service is 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.080
 available already at national level also 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.180
 at certain points you are going to generate 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.850
 you choose mobile data and here you can 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.340
 see that the lt version is activated here 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 is deactivated here we activate it and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.150
 it's there it works now there are two ways 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.270
 also if you do not want to activate it from your 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.460
 phone with a good 3 connection 3 that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 Now 4 is good with a 3g connection or 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.090
 wifi you can connect it to your computer 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 and download the update also there 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 as you know the network lte is new in 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.300
 our country by telcel is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 functioning in certain points of the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.200
 city ​​also from mexico then when 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.080
 you see there is red lte available 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.550
 we have in these letters that lte or 4g and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.769
 if it is not available in the lte network 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.099
 then immediately go down to 3 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.099
 people
