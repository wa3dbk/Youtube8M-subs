00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.720
 in this video I do not try to say that a 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.059
 of these bands are bad if it's not a 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.070
 healthy competition between two bands if 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:10.930
 you were offended by the video I ask you 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.940
 what reasons well what are you going to comment 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.940
 by neck I'm not offending anyone 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.869
 April 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.640
 what is better megadeth metallica 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.670
 we will start with metal metallic 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.360
 he founded in california california us in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.160
 the year of 1981 the original formation of 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.560
 metallica was from lars ulrich as 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.660
 drummer james hetfield as vocalist 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.820
 and rhythmic guitar achieving as 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.460
 main guitarist and ron mcnair as 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.710
 bassist Dave Mustain was the second 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.210
 metallica's main guitarist came in 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.310
 in 1982 and they took it out in 1983 happy I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 like and when leaving metallica angry 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.470
 he founded his own band which I call mega 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 from now let's go mega by megadeth it 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.190
 he founded in california california us in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.140
 the year of 1983 the original formation of 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.450
 megadeth was famous time as 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 vocalist and rhythmic guitar happy the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.650
 epson as bassist craig harvey as 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.259
 lead guitarist and villota reuters 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.330
 as a metallica and megadeth drummer 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.340
 they had some rivalry rather the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.920
 only one that was angry with metallica 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.780
 it was dave mustain once said that if not 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.600
 they would have taken it out of metallica right now 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.820
 they would be bigger 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 the hatred I had for her as a metal daughter 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.230
 ended up being in the 'big four' of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.130
 trash metal in which it was metallic 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.959
 mind slayer and anthrax as we already saw a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.940
 part of the history of each band and its 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.720
 relationship now we will see quality in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.350
 antique metal was founded in 1981 and 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.569
 megadeth in 1983 is not that much difference 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.330
 of time but in antiquity it is better 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.650
 metal in original members I think 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.600
 that are a little like 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.700
 metallica has had four bears and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.860
 three different main guitarists 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.739
 leaving javier james as the only ones 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.600
 original members with megadeth have 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.180
 had eight main guitarists 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.160
 seven drummers and three bass players leaving 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.860
 dave mustain as the only member 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.900
 original of the band although the bassist 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.540
 Dave Ellefson came back as the bass player 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.130
 currently in 2010 I think that in this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.260
 we agree that metallica has 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.780
 had fewer different members in 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
 the band now we will see how it has 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.370
 maintained each band as they have maintained 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.040
 to the band with time megadeth it 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.379
 founded in 1983 and separated in 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.859
 2002 until its reencounter in 2004 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.780
 metallica was founded in 1981 has not been 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 separate has been existing until the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.730
 today in this we must say 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.670
 that metallica wins now let's see 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.519
 metallic award has won 16 awards 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.980
 nine grammys two of mtv one of the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.290
 billboard two american music award one 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 Rami is one mega government has 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.239
 won four awards and 13 nominations 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.760
 a prize genesis a prize metal hammer 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.650
 gods hours a golden revolver prize 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.319
 gods know if a popular prize Moors 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.720
 goal broadcast 11 nominations to the grammy 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.269
 and two nominations for the metal hammer bots 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 trees in this is difficult to decide anymore 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.930
 that metallica has 16 awards and 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.909
 megadeth four awards and 13 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.859
 nominations let's say that in these 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.620
 they are matched by the nominations of 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.319
 may from now studio albums 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.349
 megadeth has had 14 studio albums 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.230
 and metallica 9 studio albums in this 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.480
 megadeth has had more studio albums 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.250
 now we will see some xolos de metallica the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.420
 guitar solo by kirk hammett and the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.420
 only under wood clips 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.970
 mind the guitar solo by jane austen 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.970
 and the solo under electric bass 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.830
 the first metallica discs have 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.990
 a very bad quality but his songs 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.479
 they are good said by many people their 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.460
 decadence began on his sainz jr album 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.889
 metal has become a very band 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.110
 commercial in recent years while 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.669
 that mega dt started with songs from 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.279
 quality and very good and its decadence 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.819
 they say that started at risk metals is not 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.800
 so commercial is personal opinion in my 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.719
 Personal tastes I feel metallica 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.789
 it's better than megadeth because they 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.620
 they had good moments in music to 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.810
 despite its horrible overvaluation 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.749
 saint is also his worst album but to me 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.669
 I like several songs from that album 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:08.520
 my opinion does not count on knowing what band 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.919
 it's better now I'll put a survey in 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.099
 facebook of which band is better and so 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.110
 seen metallic has more votes I think 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.300
 we'll finish by saying which band is better 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.219
 but this is counting the things that I put 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.199
 here is not my preference so why 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.689
 the metal results is better than 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.830
 megadeth here are the points of the 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.830
 things that qualify 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.710
 and a personal opinion I wrote before 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.780
 of doing the results well that's 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.670
 I hope everything and have not got angry with the 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.130
 result maybe if I had qualified 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.020
 more things maybe the result would have 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.690
 been different or maybe it would have been 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.400
 Like you never know I say goodbye to us 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.400
 we see in the next video bye bye
