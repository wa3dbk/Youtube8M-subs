00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.090 
just pick a number but that is not what
you<00:02:42.510> want<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.840> because<00:02:43.350> first<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:43.800> you

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you want to do because first of all you

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.510 
you want to do because first of all you
got<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.550> hit<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> stopwatch<00:02:45.330> on<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.989> speed

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
got to hit the stopwatch on the speed

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.670 
got to hit the stopwatch on the speed
100<00:02:47.520> where<00:02:48.420> well<00:02:48.870> where<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.350> want<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
100 where well where you want to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.000 
100 where well where you want to
transition<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.100> start<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.239> let's<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
transition to start so let's do that and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.570 
transition to start so let's do that and
then<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.840> let's<00:02:54.840> say<00:02:54.959> next<00:02:55.200> frame<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:57.140> pick

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
then go to let's say next frame and pick

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.410 
then go to let's say next frame and pick
let's<00:02:59.580> say<00:02:59.790> one<00:03:00.860> because<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.820> will<00:03:03.000> get<00:03:03.120> there

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
let's say one because you will get there

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.199 
let's say one because you will get there
an<00:03:04.230> extra<00:03:04.590> motion<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:07.650> easy<00:03:07.920> its<00:03:08.459> release

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
an extra motion so it's easy its release

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.580 
an extra motion so it's easy its release
is<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:11.100> difficult<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.350> then<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.470> want

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
is not that difficult and then you want

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.580 
is not that difficult and then you want
to<00:03:13.680> go<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.390> see<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.020> grab<00:03:16.320> tea

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
to go you see here we got a grab tea

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.870 
to go you see here we got a grab tea
like<00:03:17.190> normal<00:03:17.670> speed<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:19.160> where<00:03:20.160> we<00:03:20.340> pick

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
like normal speed and then where we pick

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.690 
like normal speed and then where we pick
the<00:03:21.120> speed<00:03:21.360> one<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.440> will<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.010> motion

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
the speed one you will get this motion

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.949 
the speed one you will get this motion
but<00:03:24.630> maybe<00:03:24.920> you<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.310> motion<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.959> stop

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
but maybe you want this motion to stop

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.850 
but maybe you want this motion to stop
on<00:03:29.630> no<00:03:31.160> pic<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.630> your<00:03:33.780> keyboard<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.380> get<00:03:34.650> up

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
on no pic you on your keyboard to get up

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.370 
on no pic you on your keyboard to get up
you're<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:38.060> effect<00:03:39.060> used<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.170> your

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
you're like the effect used to see your

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.870 
you're like the effect used to see your
key<00:03:41.190> frames<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.769> want<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.220> here

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
key frames and then you want to go here

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.640 
key frames and then you want to go here
is<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:46.320> starting<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.329> motion<00:03:48.380> maybe<00:03:49.380> go

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
is the starting of the motion maybe go

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
is the starting of the motion maybe go
like<00:03:50.299> one<00:03:51.299> second<00:03:51.750> or<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.280> what<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.489> have

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
like one second or so and what you have

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.009 
like one second or so and what you have
to<00:03:53.820> do<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.829> click<00:03:55.829> this<00:03:56.040> button<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.459> get<00:03:57.150> like

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
to do is click this button to get like

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.410 
to do is click this button to get like
one<00:03:58.410> more<00:03:58.620> key<00:03:58.890> frame<00:03:59.190> on<00:03:59.780> speed<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:03.239> do

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
one more key frame on speed one you do

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.470 
one more key frame on speed one you do
like<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.709> then<00:04:04.890> go<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.670> next<00:04:05.970> frame

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
like that and then go to the next frame

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.090 
like that and then go to the next frame
and<00:04:06.890> pick<00:04:07.890> one<00:04:08.780> hundred<00:04:09.780> yeah<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:12.329> as<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.570> see

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
and pick one hundred yeah so as you see

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.620 
and pick one hundred yeah so as you see
you<00:04:14.100> will<00:04:14.310> get<00:04:15.320> normal<00:04:16.320> speed<00:04:17.329> here<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.479> thus

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
you will get normal speed here is thus

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.480 
you will get normal speed here is thus
emotion<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:21.720> normal<00:04:22.440> speed<00:04:22.620> yeah<00:04:22.770> let's

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
emotion and then normal speed yeah let's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.930 
emotion and then normal speed yeah let's
say<00:04:23.760> quite<00:04:24.630> easy<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.229> do

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
say quite easy to do

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.910 
say quite easy to do

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
second than one and you use only

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.470 
second than one and you use only
eclipsed<00:04:53.100> ops<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.710> ends<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.390> what<00:04:57.390> you
