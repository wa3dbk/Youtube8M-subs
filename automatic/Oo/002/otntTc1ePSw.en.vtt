going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.229> connect<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> arch<00:01:35.009> point<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> your

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going to connect the arch point of your

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.690 
going to connect the arch point of your
brow<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> tail<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.130> finish<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
brow to the tail and to finish the

outline connect the front mark to the
arch<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:41.850> again<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.350> create

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
arch point again and this should create

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.569 
arch point again and this should create
an<00:01:44.360> elongated<00:01:45.360> triangle<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.380> shape<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
an elongated triangle like shape and I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.850 
an elongated triangle like shape and I
like<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> keep<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> front<00:01:48.659> part<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> open

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
like to keep the front part of this open

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.590 
like to keep the front part of this open
and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.340> guys<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.790> why<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.329> a

and you guys will see why in just a
little<00:01:51.869> bit<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.530> might<00:01:52.740> look<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> silly

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
little bit it might look kind of silly

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.490

right now but you will see the brow come

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
right now but you will see the brow come
together<00:01:55.890> once<00:01:56.219> everything<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.969> nicely

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
together once everything is nicely

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.050 
together once everything is nicely
blended<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.490> left<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.820> do

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
blended out so now all that's left to do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
blended out so now all that's left to do
is<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.780> simply<00:02:01.170> fill<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> brow<00:02:01.829> with

is just do simply fill in the brow with
small<00:02:02.490> strokes<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> focus

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
small strokes and you're going to focus

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.080 
small strokes and you're going to focus
most<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> product<00:02:05.219> towards<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> tail

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
most of the product towards the tail

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
most of the product towards the tail
half<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> brow<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.129> going

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
half of the brow and then you're going

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.330 
half of the brow and then you're going
to<00:02:08.280> take<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:08.610> spoolie<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.539> calm<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:09.840> your

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to take your spoolie to calm down your

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.270 
to take your spoolie to calm down your
brow<00:02:10.429> hairs<00:02:10.759> as<00:02:11.000> well<00:02:11.629> as<00:02:11.840> blendy<00:02:12.440> brow<00:02:12.739> pencil

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
brow hairs as well as blendy brow pencil

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
brow hairs as well as blendy brow pencil
and<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.970> slowly<00:02:14.300> blend<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.019> towards

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and I like to slowly blend this towards

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.440 
and I like to slowly blend this towards
the<00:02:15.680> front<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.250> brow<00:02:16.430> where<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.000> kept<00:02:17.330> it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the front of the brow where I kept it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.809 
the front of the brow where I kept it
open<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.110> gives<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.620> softer<00:02:19.250> effects

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
open and it gives it a softer effects

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.400 
open and it gives it a softer effects
and<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> make<00:02:20.450> any<00:02:20.629> mistakes<00:02:21.170> i'm

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
this is what we have right now compared

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.300 
this is what we have right now compared
to<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.970> naked<00:02:26.720> sad<00:02:27.170> brow<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.860> other<00:02:28.010> side

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
to my naked sad brow on the other side

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.650 
to my naked sad brow on the other side
so<00:02:28.549> I'm<00:02:28.640> just<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:28.940> speed<00:02:29.239> through<00:02:29.510> this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so I'm just going to speed through this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.750 
so I'm just going to speed through this
part<00:02:29.959> really<00:02:30.170> quick<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.410> do<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.769> same<00:02:31.160> process

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
part really quick to do the same process

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.729 
part really quick to do the same process
and<00:02:31.970> fill<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.870> sprout<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> I'm<00:02:33.349> gonna<00:02:33.470> do

and fill in the sprout and I'm gonna do
it<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.980> little<00:02:34.450> crazier<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:36.319> because

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
it a little crazier just because

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.500 
it a little crazier just because
mistakes<00:02:37.069> happen<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.730> sometimes<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.330> get<00:02:38.450> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.870 
pencil and i'm going to show you how i
can<00:02:42.170> fix<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.709> they<00:02:43.069> say<00:02:43.310> your<00:02:43.489> brows<00:02:43.640> don't

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
can fix this they say your brows don't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.670 
can fix this they say your brows don't
have<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> be<00:02:44.239> exactly<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.079> same<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.410> both

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
have to be exactly the same on both

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.220 
have to be exactly the same on both
sides<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.700> because<00:02:47.090> they<00:02:47.239> naturally<00:02:47.780> aren't

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
sides just because they naturally aren't

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.710 
sides just because they naturally aren't
but<00:02:48.739> say<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.130> made<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.849> one<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.329> way<00:02:50.660> too

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.710 
the front of the brow you should have a
little<00:02:58.250> bit<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.610> gradient<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.390> your<00:02:59.510> brows

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
from the front to the back and I'm also

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.910 
from the front to the back and I'm also
just<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.510> take<00:03:02.660> my<00:03:02.900> finger<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.560> kind<00:03:03.860> of

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
round off the front of it to make it a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.140 
round off the front of it to make it a
little<00:03:06.319> bit<00:03:06.500> more<00:03:06.650> natural<00:03:07.129> looking<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.640> then
