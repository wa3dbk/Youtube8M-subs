00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:10.970

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
probably be consistent but I could sort

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.680 
probably be consistent but I could sort

write we think of it as something that
maybe<00:00:57.319> boys<00:00:57.769> would<00:00:57.979> choose<00:00:58.190> not<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.519> do<00:00:58.639> but

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789

and share but these kids are also there
for<00:01:10.160> each<00:01:10.520> other<00:01:10.670> they're<00:01:11.000> real<00:01:11.120> supports<00:01:11.510> for

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
for each other they're real supports for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.050 
for each other they're real supports for
each<00:01:11.690> other<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.110> how<00:01:12.650> how<00:01:13.460> positive<00:01:13.970> they

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
each other and how how positive they

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.430 
each other and how how positive they
were<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.510> without<00:01:14.690> any<00:01:14.870> training<00:01:15.140> either

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
were and without any training either

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.840 
were and without any training either
these<00:01:15.740> kids<00:01:15.950> haven't<00:01:16.100> been<00:01:16.160> really<00:01:16.370> taught<00:01:16.640> to

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
these kids haven't been really taught to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.330 
these kids haven't been really taught to
respond<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.650> sophisticated<00:01:18.650> way<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.130> each

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
respond in a sophisticated way to each

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.720 
respond in a sophisticated way to each
other's<00:01:19.610> writing<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.660> I<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.700> one<00:01:22.700> of

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
other's writing so I think that one of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.920 
other's writing so I think that one of
the<00:01:22.790> ways<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.150> can<00:01:23.270> look<00:01:23.390> at<00:01:23.570> reading

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
the ways that you can look at reading

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.260 
the ways that you can look at reading
writing<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.380> pleasure<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.400> two<00:01:25.760> kids<00:01:25.970> do<00:01:26.150> it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
writing is pleasure and two kids do it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.390 
writing is pleasure and two kids do it
because<00:01:26.720> they<00:01:26.810> enjoy<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.890> was<00:01:28.370> really

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
because they enjoy it and I was really

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.130 
because they enjoy it and I was really
struck<00:01:28.850> by<00:01:28.880> these<00:01:29.240> are<00:01:29.390> kids<00:01:29.570> who<00:01:29.660> enjoy

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
struck by these are kids who enjoy

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.170 
struck by these are kids who enjoy
writing<00:01:30.920> enjoy<00:01:31.370> listening<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.850> each<00:01:31.940> other's

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
writing enjoy listening to each other's

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.020 
writing enjoy listening to each other's
writing<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.960> think<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.740> um<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.280> know

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
writing and I think that um you know

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.610 
writing and I think that um you know
everything<00:01:35.510> that<00:01:35.630> we<00:01:35.720> do<00:01:35.900> should<00:01:36.320> be<00:01:36.410> geared

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
everything that we do should be geared

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.950 
everything that we do should be geared
toward<00:01:36.920> are<00:01:37.100> we<00:01:37.220> creating<00:01:37.790> lifelong<00:01:38.270> writers

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
toward are we creating lifelong writers

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.680 
toward are we creating lifelong writers
and<00:01:39.410> something<00:01:40.190> like<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.430> writing<00:01:40.640> Club<00:01:41.480> that

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
and something like the writing Club that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.580 
and something like the writing Club that
Jen<00:01:42.080> has<00:01:42.290> started<00:01:42.740> here<00:01:43.100> at<00:01:43.240> her<00:01:44.240> school<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
Jen has started here at her school I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.470 
Jen has started here at her school I
think<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.700> going<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:46.940> move<00:01:47.090> these<00:01:47.210> kids

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
think is just going to move these kids

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.770 
think is just going to move these kids
on<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.750> be<00:01:47.870> writers<00:01:48.320> for<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.530> whole<00:01:48.650> lives

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.770 

it's<00:01:52.780> kind<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.110> like<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:55.270> short<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.630> all

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
it's kind of like really short it's all

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.530 
it's kind of like really short it's all
about<00:01:58.960> basketball
