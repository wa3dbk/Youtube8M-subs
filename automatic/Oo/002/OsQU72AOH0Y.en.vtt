00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 I like Chinese rice other delicacies 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.940
 is that they usually put in the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.319
 Chinese restaurant because today we are going to see 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.319
 how easy it is to do it at home 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.650
 The first thing we are going to do is put the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.710
 rice the rice in that long grain in a 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.330
 saucepan together with vegetable oil and sautÃ© 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.790
 then a minute or a minute and a half 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.500
 Then we add the broth that should 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.420
 Being hot is very important 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.059
 it's hot and we 're going to leave it 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.770
 cooking for 10 12 minutes past 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.610
 this time as you see has consumed everything 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.680
 the water all the broth and we already have it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.390
 ready to cool it this is the trick 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.120
 so that we stay then very crispy 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.730
 we are going to extend it in a good source 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.520
 extended for us to cool everything 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 we'll leave it here cooling 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.410
 while we continue with the rest of the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 Steps 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.720
 in a pan or in a wok like I have 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.630
 used I 'm going to put the carrot 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 grated if you like in dice then 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.050
 You can also put it in cubes but 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.760
 I like the grated carrot together 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.490
 with a little bit of oil and we're going to 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.270
 water then add the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.380
 green peas 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.679
 and then the ham cooked in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.750
 taquitos we cut everything down until it 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.159
 do a little bit you do not need much 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.280
 time and then we add the rice 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.509
 we remove everything to mix 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.130
 we cook a couple of minutes and add 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.890
 the soy sauce that is going to give the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.520
 point of salt 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.130
 to our Chinese rice we leave while 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.200
 so much and let's beat an egg nothing of 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.390
 French omelet we put an egg 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.130
 and when it's hot, we're going to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 remove for us to do those 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.560
 characteristics of shining that we can 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.450
