00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
on stick model nobody got me a little

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.009 
on stick model nobody got me a little
motor<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.430> there<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.150> blade<00:03:03.330> I'd<00:03:05.840> like<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> four

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
motor on there and blade I'd like a four

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.710 
motor on there and blade I'd like a four
and<00:03:07.079> half<00:03:07.140> million<00:03:07.440> motor<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:09.000> three<00:03:09.480> bolts

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and half million motor but three bolts

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.509 
and half million motor but three bolts
it<00:03:09.930> wants<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.230> cross<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> floor<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:10.920> I'm

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it wants to cross the floor so I'm

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.789 
it wants to cross the floor so I'm
pretty<00:03:11.640> sure<00:03:11.820> one<00:03:12.780> cell<00:03:12.959> bury<00:03:13.170> three<00:03:13.560> volts

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
pretty sure one cell bury three volts

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.130 
pretty sure one cell bury three volts
good<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.269> take<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.540> thing<00:03:15.600> outside<00:03:15.810> man

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
good now I take this thing outside man

good now I take this thing outside man
any<00:03:16.290> glides<00:03:16.470> forever<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.610> great
