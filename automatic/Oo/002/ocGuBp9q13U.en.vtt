00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
like I was so confused and I don't know

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.270 
like I was so confused and I don't know
if<00:02:33.930> there's<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.170> Shafter<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:35.010> nice

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
if there's like Shafter and a nice

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.819 
if there's like Shafter and a nice
little<00:02:35.879> handle<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.319> anything<00:02:37.680> like

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
little handle all you know anything like

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.099 
little handle all you know anything like
that<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.459> no<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.930> long

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
that but no it's just like the long

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.259 
that but no it's just like the long
handle<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.859> i<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.000> s'posed

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
handle because i think it's s'posed

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.720 
handle because i think it's s'posed
before<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.109> know<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> sharpen<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.220> you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
before you know when you sharpen it you

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.670 
before you know when you sharpen it you
can<00:02:44.939> still<00:02:45.299> use<00:02:45.659> it<00:02:45.690> even<00:02:46.049> if<00:02:46.409> it's<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
can still use it even if it's like a

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520 
can still use it even if it's like a
little<00:02:46.950> tiny<00:02:47.069> stubby<00:02:47.430> thing<00:02:48.140> which<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.170> quite

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
little tiny stubby thing which is quite

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.500 
little tiny stubby thing which is quite
a<00:02:49.590> clever<00:02:49.799> idea<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.489> i<00:02:50.670> don't<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.299> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
a clever idea but i don't think you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.270 
a clever idea but i don't think you
would<00:02:51.599> need<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.409> much<00:02:52.470> i<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:52.889> it's<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.159> bit

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
would need this much i think it's a bit

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.180 
would need this much i think it's a bit
of<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.609> waste<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.510> packaging<00:02:55.349> may<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.920> my

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
of a waste of packaging may be so my

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.750 
of a waste of packaging may be so my
color<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.000> kind<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.750> nude<00:02:58.400> skin<00:02:59.400> colored

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
color is a kind of nude skin colored
