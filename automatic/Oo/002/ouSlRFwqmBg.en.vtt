00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.970 
so again something else should speed
things<00:03:05.129> up<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.290> now<00:03:07.290> as<00:03:07.500> most<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.860> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
things up for you now as most of you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.170 
things up for you now as most of you
will<00:03:08.040> probably<00:03:08.099> have<00:03:08.430> seen<00:03:08.670> when<00:03:08.879> our<00:03:09.030> when

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
will probably have seen when our when

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.970 
will probably have seen when our when
you're<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.420> done<00:03:09.629> is<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:09.989> lots<00:03:10.200> going<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.680> or

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
you're in done is with lots going on or

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.619 
you're in done is with lots going on or
maybe<00:03:11.190> when<00:03:11.430> you're<00:03:11.610> faced<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:11.970> loads<00:03:12.480> of

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
maybe when you're faced with loads of

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.270 
maybe when you're faced with loads of
people<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> map<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.650> spell<00:03:13.890> effects<00:03:14.129> can

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
people on the map the spell effects can

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.369 
people on the map the spell effects can
come<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.550> can<00:03:15.209> become<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> bit<00:03:15.750> overwhelming

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
come up can become a bit overwhelming

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.979 
come up can become a bit overwhelming
it's<00:03:17.310> hard<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:17.730> what's<00:03:17.909> going<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.900> I'd

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
it's hard to see what's going on so I'd

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.449 
it's hard to see what's going on so I'd
recommend<00:03:19.110> actually<00:03:19.530> toning<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.099> spell

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
recommend actually toning the spell

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.670 
recommend actually toning the spell
effects<00:03:20.760> down<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:22.560> just

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
effects down and to do this you just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.940 
effects down and to do this you just
need<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.069> into<00:03:23.220> character<00:03:23.700> configuration

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
need to go into character configuration

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.470 
need to go into character configuration
and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.430> select<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> character<00:03:27.239> tab

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and then you select the character tab

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600 
and then you select the character tab
and<00:03:27.959> go<00:03:28.260> down<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.500> battle<00:03:29.040> effects<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
and go down to battle effects at the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.640 
and go down to battle effects at the
bottom<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.540> I've<00:03:30.780> got<00:03:30.989> my<00:03:31.140> own<00:03:31.290> effects

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
bottom now I've got my own effects

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.110 
bottom now I've got my own effects
turned<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> show<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.580> them<00:03:32.849> because<00:03:33.060> I

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120

actually shows where we're behind the
enemy<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.889> which<00:05:59.099> is<00:05:59.250> great<00:05:59.490> for<00:05:59.520> classes<00:06:00.120> like

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
enemy is which is great for classes like

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.050 
enemy is which is great for classes like
pugilist<00:06:01.199> for<00:06:01.409> example<00:06:01.919> you<00:06:02.520> have<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.849> tax

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
pugilist for example you have the tax

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.089 
pugilist for example you have the tax
that<00:06:03.240> can<00:06:03.330> only<00:06:03.419> be<00:06:03.569> used<00:06:03.810> from<00:06:03.930> behind<00:06:04.229> all

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
that can only be used from behind all

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.499 
that can only be used from behind all
the<00:06:05.340> time<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.639> might<00:06:05.789> be<00:06:05.969> obvious<00:06:06.360> we're

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
the time it might be obvious we're

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.779 
the time it might be obvious we're
behind<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.080> enemy<00:06:07.229> is<00:06:07.529> the<00:06:07.789> sometimes

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
behind the enemy is the sometimes

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.339 
behind the enemy is the sometimes
they're<00:06:08.940> not<00:06:08.969> always<00:06:09.180> designed<00:06:09.659> that<00:06:09.900> well<00:06:10.080> so

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
they're not always designed that well so

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.050 
they're not always designed that well so
you<00:06:10.409> know<00:06:10.770> you<00:06:10.830> can't<00:06:11.159> tell<00:06:11.370> front<00:06:11.669> from<00:06:11.849> back

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
you know you can't tell front from back

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.480 
you know you can't tell front from back
and<00:06:12.960> in<00:06:13.139> dungeons<00:06:13.620> for<00:06:13.740> example<00:06:14.219> it<00:06:14.310> gets

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
and in dungeons for example it gets

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.309 
and in dungeons for example it gets
clustered<00:06:15.060> there's<00:06:15.569> a<00:06:15.630> lot<00:06:15.779> of<00:06:15.810> enemies<00:06:16.169> on

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
clustered there's a lot of enemies on

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.499 
clustered there's a lot of enemies on
screen<00:06:16.349> and<00:06:16.860> so<00:06:17.490> it<00:06:17.580> can<00:06:17.699> be<00:06:17.759> really<00:06:17.940> handy<00:06:18.180> to

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
screen and so it can be really handy to

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.969 
screen and so it can be really handy to
use<00:06:18.539> that<00:06:18.810> circle<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.409> get<00:06:19.560> yourself<00:06:19.830> into

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
use that circle to get yourself into

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.559 
use that circle to get yourself into
position<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.550> use<00:06:20.849> your<00:06:21.029> more<00:06:21.180> stronger

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
position to use your more stronger

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.680 
position to use your more stronger
attacks<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:23.210> finally<00:06:24.210> something<00:06:24.509> which<00:06:24.630> are

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
attacks and finally something which are

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.149 
attacks and finally something which are
just<00:06:24.840> learning<00:06:24.990> about<00:06:25.289> the<00:06:25.529> last<00:06:25.680> 20<00:06:25.860> minutes

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
just learning about the last 20 minutes

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.040 
just learning about the last 20 minutes
or<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:26.580> is<00:06:27.360> that<00:06:27.419> when<00:06:27.630> you're<00:06:27.750> on<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:27.900> main

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
or so is that when you're on the main

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.019 
or so is that when you're on the main
screen<00:06:28.259> you<00:06:28.590> can<00:06:28.710> actually<00:06:28.919> just<00:06:29.159> use<00:06:29.819> the

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
screen you can actually just use the

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.600 
screen you can actually just use the
nort<00:06:30.300> on<00:06:30.509> your<00:06:30.659> number<00:06:30.810> pad<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:32.159> quickly<00:06:32.490> get

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
nort on your number pad to quickly get

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.070 
nort on your number pad to quickly get
through<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:32.969> menu<00:06:33.270> so<00:06:33.419> when<00:06:33.570> you<00:06:33.659> press<00:06:33.839> nor
