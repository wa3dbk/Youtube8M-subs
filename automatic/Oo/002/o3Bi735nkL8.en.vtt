motherboard<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.910> an

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
motherboard so this is going to be an

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.660 
motherboard so this is going to be an
unboxing<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.929> motherboard<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.679> let's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
unboxing of this motherboard and let's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.360 
unboxing of this motherboard and let's
take<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> look<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> Box<00:00:12.660> first<00:00:12.980> so<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
take a look at the Box first so it is a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.340 
take a look at the Box first so it is a
micro<00:00:14.759> ATX<00:00:14.849> board<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:15.990> see<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
micro ATX board so as you can see it's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.570 
micro ATX board so as you can see it's
not<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.039> big<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.320> box<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.680> square<00:00:19.770> shape<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
not so big the box is square shape and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.710 
not so big the box is square shape and
how<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> sticker<00:00:21.769> giving<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.310> import<00:00:24.180> date<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
how a sticker giving the import date the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
how a sticker giving the import date the
MRP<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> uses<00:00:29.929> 1155<00:00:30.949> 1150<00:00:31.949> socket

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
MRP and all so it uses 1155 1150 socket

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
MRP and all so it uses 1155 1150 socket
as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> also<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
as you can see right here and also it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.900 
as you can see right here and also it
uses<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.219> v85<00:00:38.969> chipset<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.910> use

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
uses the v85 chipset so I'm gonna use

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.100 
uses the v85 chipset so I'm gonna use

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
giving you some of the main software is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.190 
giving you some of the main software is
needed<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.660> guess<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
needed and that's about it I guess so

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
needed and that's about it I guess so
happening<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.130> flap<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.120> small

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
happening this flap you have this small

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.860 
happening this flap you have this small
tiny<00:02:43.430> micro<00:02:44.430> ATX<00:02:44.489> motherboard<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.600> think

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
tiny micro ATX motherboard and I think

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.280 
tiny micro ATX motherboard and I think
that's<00:02:46.050> about<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:47.660> yeah<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> keeping<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.020> ball

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
that's about it yeah so keeping the ball

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.600 
that's about it yeah so keeping the ball
now<00:02:52.620> aside<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> moment<00:02:54.500> now<00:02:55.500> let's<00:02:55.770> take

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
now aside for the moment now let's take

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.100 
now aside for the moment now let's take
the<00:02:57.180> motherboard<00:02:57.690> out<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.290> cover<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.989> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the motherboard out of this cover so it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.470 
the motherboard out of this cover so it
is<00:03:01.230> actually<00:03:01.680> covered<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.760> plastic<00:03:02.910> cover

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
is actually covered in a plastic cover

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.729 
is actually covered in a plastic cover
and<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.840> sealed<00:03:04.140> off<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.930> let<00:03:10.110> me<00:03:10.260> be<00:03:10.410> really

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
and it is sealed off so let me be really

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:19.250 
and it is sealed off so let me be really
careful<00:03:11.220> taking<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.180> system<00:03:12.600> oh<00:03:17.840> wow

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
careful taking this system oh wow

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.090 
careful taking this system oh wow

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
micro idiots like I said and here we can

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.630 
micro idiots like I said and here we can
see<00:03:28.830> before<00:03:33.200> memory<00:03:34.200> card<00:03:34.530> slot<00:03:34.860> ddr3

spotting<00:03:36.500> they<00:03:37.500> got<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.860> chipset<00:03:38.280> here<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
spotting they got the chipset here the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.740 
spotting they got the chipset here the
