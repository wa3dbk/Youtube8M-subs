consider the possibility it very well
could<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.770> alien<00:02:18.770> ship<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.730> don't<00:02:20.209> know

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
could be a alien ship and I I don't know

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.270 
could be a alien ship and I I don't know
I<00:02:20.720> guess<00:02:21.560> that's<00:02:21.770> why<00:02:21.890> they<00:02:22.010> call<00:02:22.040> him

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
I guess that's why they call him

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.060 
I guess that's why they call him
unidentified<00:02:23.120> objects<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.620> don't<00:02:24.890> know<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
unidentified objects and I don't know I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.250 
unidentified objects and I don't know I
do<00:02:25.310> know<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.910> wasn't<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.450> plane<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.170> I've

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
do know that it wasn't a plane that I've

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.709 
do know that it wasn't a plane that I've
ever<00:02:27.440> seen<00:02:27.650> before
