00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
if you're using this for let's say a

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.920 
if you're using this for let's say a
theater<00:03:25.799> PC<00:03:26.250> or<00:03:27.260> TV<00:03:28.349> DVR<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.939> easily<00:03:30.090> put

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
theater PC or TV DVR you can easily put

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.039 
theater PC or TV DVR you can easily put
this<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.200> slant<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.859> needed<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
this on a slant if you needed to on the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.459 
this on a slant if you needed to on the
back<00:03:34.200> side<00:03:34.469> we<00:03:34.709> do<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:36.290> placement<00:03:37.290> here

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
back side we do have the placement here

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.119 
back side we do have the placement here
for<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.799> batteries<00:03:38.189> so<00:03:39.439> this<00:03:40.439> one<00:03:40.650> here<00:03:40.889> does

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
for the batteries so this one here does

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.509 
for the batteries so this one here does
use<00:03:41.450> double-a<00:03:42.450> batteries<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:44.010> does<00:03:44.280> use

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
use double-a batteries and it does use

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.250 
use double-a batteries and it does use
two<00:03:44.819> double-a<00:03:45.269> batteries<00:03:45.599> as<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.079> see

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
two double-a batteries as you can see

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.099 
two double-a batteries as you can see
here<00:03:46.500> these<00:03:46.620> are<00:03:46.680> Duracell

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
here these are Duracell

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.979 
here these are Duracell
but<00:03:49.849> aside<00:03:50.849> from<00:03:50.909> that<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.689> it's<00:03:51.870> not

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
but aside from that you know it's not

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.229 
but aside from that you know it's not
it's<00:03:52.230> not<00:03:52.379> anything<00:03:53.189> expensive<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.120> you're

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
it's not anything expensive so you're

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.490 
it's not anything expensive so you're
not<00:03:54.329> using<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.840> those<00:03:54.989> triple-a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
not using one of those triple-a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.869 
not using one of those triple-a
batteries<00:03:55.949> which<00:03:56.099> are<00:03:56.219> typically<00:03:56.609> more

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
batteries which are typically more

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:04.610 
batteries which are typically more
expensive<00:03:59.419> aside<00:04:00.419> from<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:03.439> you<00:04:04.439> basically

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
expensive aside from that you basically

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.670 
expensive aside from that you basically
connect<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.609> dongle<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.079> USB<00:04:07.379> dongle

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
connect the dongle it's a USB dongle
