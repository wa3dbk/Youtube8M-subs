it was always out stock but that's a
soft<00:05:17.140> color<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.620> is<00:05:17.940> it's<00:05:18.940> really<00:05:19.330> pretty

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
this looks like a very interesting

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.340 
this looks like a very interesting
concept<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.580> this<00:05:36.940> is<00:05:37.060> what<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.270> looks<00:05:37.420> like<00:05:37.600> it

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
concept so this is what it looks like it

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.620 
concept so this is what it looks like it
says<00:05:38.530> 17<00:05:39.010> on<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:40.240> have<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.420> mirror

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
says 17 on that and you have a mirror

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.560 
says 17 on that and you have a mirror
there<00:05:41.350> you<00:05:41.500> are<00:05:41.650> there's<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.040> camera<00:05:42.570> the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
there you are there's the camera the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.870 
there you are there's the camera the
idea<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.260> is<00:05:44.500> your<00:05:44.950> color<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:45.610> there

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
idea of this is your color is in there

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.390 
idea of this is your color is in there
as<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:46.960> see<00:05:47.050> it's<00:05:47.200> a<00:05:47.230> really<00:05:47.590> nice<00:05:47.980> color

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
as you can see it's a really nice color

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.800 
as you can see it's a really nice color
it<00:05:48.580> says<00:05:48.730> that<00:05:48.760> it's<00:05:48.970> pink<00:05:49.240> but<00:05:49.450> it's<00:05:49.600> not<00:05:49.780> a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
it says that it's pink but it's not a

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.190 
it says that it's pink but it's not a
pink<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.860> more<00:05:51.100> of<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.340> sort<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.610> coral<00:05:52.200> color

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
pink it's more of a sort of coral color

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.910 
pink it's more of a sort of coral color
then<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:54.070> is<00:05:54.250> your<00:05:54.330> little<00:05:55.410> cheeks<00:05:56.410> stamp

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
then this is your little cheeks stamp

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.210 
then this is your little cheeks stamp
you<00:05:57.760> put<00:05:58.060> your<00:05:58.210> color<00:05:58.390> in<00:05:58.570> there<00:05:58.890> put<00:05:59.890> it<00:05:59.980> down

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
you put your color in there put it down

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.130 
you put your color in there put it down
apparently<00:06:01.180> you're<00:06:01.270> supposed<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.630> stamp<00:06:01.930> it

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
apparently you're supposed to stamp it

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.850 
apparently you're supposed to stamp it
onto<00:06:02.410> your<00:06:02.800> face<00:06:03.510> like<00:06:04.510> that<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:05.050> then<00:06:05.500> sort

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
onto your face like that and then sort

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.500 
onto your face like that and then sort
of<00:06:05.890> buffer<00:06:06.160> in<00:06:06.310> with<00:06:06.550> your<00:06:06.670> fingers<00:06:07.060> I<00:06:07.210> think

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
of buffer in with your fingers I think

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.780 
of buffer in with your fingers I think
that's<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.990> general<00:06:08.290> idea<00:06:08.440> of<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.980> don't

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
that's the general idea of it don't

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.710 
that's the general idea of it don't
quote<00:06:10.030> me<00:06:10.210> on<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.360> but<00:06:11.790> yeah<00:06:12.790> so<00:06:13.390> it<00:06:13.510> sort<00:06:13.690> of

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
quote me on it but yeah so it sort of

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.850 
quote me on it but yeah so it sort of
does<00:06:14.430> composite<00:06:15.430> and<00:06:15.610> then<00:06:15.850> you<00:06:16.000> sort<00:06:16.180> of

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
does composite and then you sort of

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.950 
does composite and then you sort of
undo<00:06:18.860> that<00:06:18.910> you<00:06:19.910> can't<00:06:20.120> really<00:06:20.270> see<00:06:20.390> it<00:06:20.540> at<00:06:20.720> all

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
undo that you can't really see it at all

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.950 
undo that you can't really see it at all
on<00:06:21.200> there<00:06:21.380> but<00:06:21.620> general<00:06:22.490> idea<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:23.750> quite

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
on there but general idea it's quite

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.370 
on there but general idea it's quite
good<00:06:24.230> I<00:06:24.290> think<00:06:24.440> it's<00:06:24.680> quite<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.860> good<00:06:24.980> idea

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
good I think it's quite a good idea

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.630 
good I think it's quite a good idea
because<00:06:27.380> when<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:27.740> sort<00:06:27.920> of<00:06:28.010> twizzle<00:06:28.370> it<00:06:28.460> up

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
because when you sort of twizzle it up

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.400 
because when you sort of twizzle it up
it<00:06:28.880> sort<00:06:29.120> of<00:06:29.150> gets<00:06:29.360> some<00:06:29.660> of<00:06:29.780> the<00:06:29.840> color<00:06:30.050> ready

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
it sort of gets some of the color ready

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.170 
it sort of gets some of the color ready
on<00:06:30.620> there<00:06:30.830> for<00:06:31.100> you<00:06:31.280> so<00:06:31.670> yeah<00:06:31.790> I<00:06:31.820> think<00:06:31.910> that's

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
on there for you so yeah I think that's

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.320 
on there for you so yeah I think that's
quite<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.420> interesting<00:06:33.340> idea<00:06:34.340> can't<00:06:35.120> wait<00:06:35.180> to
