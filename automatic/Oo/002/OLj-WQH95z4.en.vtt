know it's good to have an opportunity to
do<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:34.970> because<00:04:35.330> I've<00:04:35.539> been<00:04:35.660> on<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> circuit

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.240 
do that because I've been on a circuit
you<00:04:36.199> know<00:04:36.320> for<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.470> long<00:04:36.590> time<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.979> I<00:04:37.010> know<00:04:37.039> that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
you know for a long time and I know that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.710 
you know for a long time and I know that
there<00:04:37.430> are<00:04:37.460> people<00:04:37.550> with<00:04:37.850> great<00:04:38.030> act<00:04:38.300> up<00:04:38.510> there

there are people with great act up there
and<00:04:38.900> it's<00:04:39.320> hard<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.860> know<00:04:39.949> where<00:04:40.099> to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
and it's hard to know you know where to

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.950 
and it's hard to know you know where to
place<00:04:40.400> them<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.630> know<00:04:41.720> they<00:04:41.840> weren't

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
place them and it you know they weren't

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.210 
place them and it you know they weren't
doing<00:04:42.169> very<00:04:42.199> long<00:04:42.530> was<00:04:42.680> like<00:04:42.770> seven<00:04:43.070> or<00:04:43.130> eight

doing very long was like seven or eight
minutes<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.750> know<00:04:44.780> it's<00:04:45.020> really<00:04:45.199> nice

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
minutes and so you know it's really nice

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.230 
minutes and so you know it's really nice
