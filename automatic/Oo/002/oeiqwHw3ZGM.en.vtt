00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.450
 That's it guys, everything's good, everything's back. 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.990
 to show you one of the main 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.960
 causing come from burning and costs 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.570
 caused in the printing plates 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.509
 famous video cards 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.720
 In this case you can see that the one that 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.440
 this hta konko board is almost everything 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.510
 destroyed by a dpc tv card or here 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.129
 you analyze the dpc tv card she is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.010
 practically obstructing almost everything 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.420
 take care of blah card graphic card 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.219
 graphics card or the video card as the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.199
 staff then knows one of the largest 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.960
 causing problems with card 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:05.050
 video and and graphics cards be boards 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.370
 who creates games or who plays games 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.909
 in games is precisely that is the question 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.960
 and obstruction of the kur who is responsible 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.509
 by cooling the heatsink 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.600
 is on the main chip of the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.299
 video or graphic card or as the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.240
 staff knows and the plates made for 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:34.450
 to play games is to cause great damage 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.259
 if the graphics card in the case suffer was a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.799
 effort the person turns to play a game more 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.740
 the video card becomes hot and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.060
 it ends up not having a cooling 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.170
 and it ends up causing short and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.439
 problems arising therefrom. 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.450
 problem and obstruction then like this 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.460
 customer who left the machine here is a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.780
 customer that I know and I know he does not 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.789
 play 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.119
 So I guess he did not come back and 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.130
 so this change is considerable 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.260
 the computer's performance there in 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.050
 relation to the video card 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.600
 Good, I'll call the customer, I'll go. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 passing this problem on to him involves 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.849
 he 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.379
 I use this dpc tv board if I do not vote 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.980
 removing it 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.680
 There you go , leaving the video card and 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.200
 quiet breathing pulls all the air that 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.780
 She has to pull and it has been cool. 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.659
 them properly 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.400
 so after that I'll be giving a deal 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.099
 on the machine also mounting a lamp 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.769
 Not even to take this is the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.860
 dust and tatÃ¡ in excess and above the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.560
 board there has a sticker you can 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.400
 compare the iaa to the clean starting 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 dirty policy 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.090
 right after the return to comment with you 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.459
 which also made the changes 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.640
 I'm going to give this general a bad mood 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.010
 the cables he not so are not 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.629
 very entangled in the middle of the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.299
 I think she's going to move again. 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.890
 this part is not because they're 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.390
 obstructing the passage of adequate air 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.760
 then is it guys in a little while I 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.760
 I 'm going back to show the outcome of this one. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.000
 computer and see what has changed and what 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.880
 changed even if on this video card back 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.639
 thermometer by placing the term 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.680
 my multimeter to show you there 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.049
 the temperature she's working on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.510
 at the moment patah comparing with the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.790
 temperature she goes she goes 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.340
 work after taking this sign of 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.470
 realize tv from georgia guys thank you and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.079
 to the next 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.250
 This is it people I'm back to show 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.709
 for you 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.109
 the temperature of the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:03.889
 video with the dpc tv board is in front of the 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.889
 club that gives in what gives passage of air 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.340
 to the sink that would be 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 messing up a little operation 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.940
 the correct graphic card 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:19.639
 video 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:27.639
 so look only at 55 degrees stopped just in 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 environment windows 55 degrees and increasing 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.840
 also wrong and these parameters and should 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:37.370
 be at least a maximum of and thus the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.629
 39 40 degrees 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.599
 and I'll be connected by customer as 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.460
 I told you about it earlier. 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:51.139
 to vote on the client's possibility 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.870
 to remove the dpc tv card 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.599
 but he did not accept to see if he uses to 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.490
 What did you have for anything else ? 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.690
 I'll clean it and see what 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.500
 will change in this parameter 56 to 57 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.169
 increasing 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.699
 Alright, guys, I'll be back from here. 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.729
 A little to show you what 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.610
 changed on that computer then your 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.750
 people back to show you are 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.150
 the result of the machine and that was 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.370
 with that dpc tv card and obstructing the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.919
 of the video card and can thus 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.909
 cause a problem in the future 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.919
 such as a short there a locking or 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.590
 perhaps the weakening of one's own 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.449
 video card or even finish 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.580
 burning of the video card itself and 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.879
 This pctv card problem is 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.460
 blocking the college of video card 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.580
 together with the internal dust 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.860
 followed the mark so I deleted the same 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.800
 from here already a little bag ready to deliver 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.949
 by customers back 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.860
 now it's without the board dbc tv all right 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:05.229
 now the scoreboard is working as 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.229
 should do is 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.719
 I'm going to show you a multimeter. 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:14.120
 What has changed yet on the issue of the 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:17.900
 temperature and the video card without 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.830
 dstv plate there is obstructing the 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.169
 air pass without that dust 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:30.910
 disturbing the refrigeration of the same 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:37.270
 oh guys 34 35 degrees celsius 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:39.130
 as it should as it should lower the 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.740
 operation of the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.440
 do not mess with the cables the cars are 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.540
 well positioned there did not have to move 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.670
 in this physical part internal cleaning 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.680
 right of that rabbit is that on top of the 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:57.460
 from a general board on the machine and now 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:01.000
 just do not do the same 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.990
 software service and deliver to the 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.230
 client 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.280
 there you can say of a machine the saved and 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.180
 of the inner rabbit 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.390
 It's alright guys until the next you liked it. 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.140
 Did you like mine from my video? 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.220
 subscribe if you liked the video but still 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.200
 a jewel 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.180
 help me promote my channel 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.180
 Thank you guys, and see you next time.
