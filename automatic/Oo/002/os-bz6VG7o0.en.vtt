the<00:03:26.739> track<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.640> sticking<00:03:27.940> on<00:03:28.150> there<00:03:28.360> and

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
the track and then sticking on there and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.509 
the track and then sticking on there and
it<00:03:28.720> was<00:03:28.810> getting<00:03:29.080> hard<00:03:29.410> before<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.160> press<00:03:30.489> it

way<00:04:52.270> more<00:04:52.300> than<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.840> does<00:04:53.050> now<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.650> mean<00:04:54.280> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
way more than it does now I mean the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.300 
way more than it does now I mean the
glue<00:04:55.660> really<00:04:56.050> helped<00:04:56.500> with<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.800> shedding<00:04:57.190> I

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
glue really helped with the shedding I

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.930 
glue really helped with the shedding I
mean<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.699> would<00:04:57.850> be<00:04:58.050> excessive<00:04:59.050> like<00:04:59.440> shedding

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
mean it would be excessive like shedding

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.360

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
now one to ten I think this area pretty

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.469 
now one to ten I think this area pretty
good<00:05:11.039> i've<00:05:11.280> been<00:05:11.400> using<00:05:11.580> this<00:05:11.849> hair<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
good i've been using this hair on and

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.200 
good i've been using this hair on and
off<00:05:12.569> for<00:05:13.050> about<00:05:13.110> three<00:05:13.740> years<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.520> i<00:05:15.030> always

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
off for about three years and i always

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.210 
off for about three years and i always
tend<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.660> go<00:05:15.810> back<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.319> it<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.949> only

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
tend to go back to it the only

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.469 
tend to go back to it the only
difference<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.509> price<00:05:18.780> has<00:05:19.080> gone<00:05:19.110> up

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
difference is that the price has gone up

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.640 
difference is that the price has gone up
more<00:05:21.479> cities<00:05:22.169> i<00:05:22.409> think<00:05:22.680> i<00:05:22.770> used<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.069> pay<00:05:23.280> like

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
more cities i think i used to pay like

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.529 
more cities i think i used to pay like
12<00:05:25.650> 99<00:05:26.009> or<00:05:26.430> fifteen<00:05:26.849> dollars<00:05:27.300> or<00:05:27.360> something

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
12 99 or fifteen dollars or something

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.270 
12 99 or fifteen dollars or something
like<00:05:27.599> that<00:05:27.659> for<00:05:27.900> one<00:05:28.080> pass<00:05:28.259> this<00:05:29.159> one<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.849> was

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
like that for one pass this one it was

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.249 
like that for one pass this one it was
1799<00:05:32.280> with<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.699> team<00:05:32.909> as<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.150> seen<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.990> most

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
1799 with the team as I seen it the most

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.399 
1799 with the team as I seen it the most
that<00:05:34.379> i<00:05:34.530> paid<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.610> see<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.509> was<00:05:36.810> nineteen

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
that i paid that I see it was nineteen

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.129 
that i paid that I see it was nineteen
ninety<00:05:37.740> nine<00:05:38.479> so<00:05:39.479> I<00:05:39.509> think<00:05:39.659> it's<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.110> really

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
ninety nine so I think it's a really

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.540 
ninety nine so I think it's a really
great<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.159> good<00:05:41.520> for<00:05:42.680> coming<00:05:43.680> away<00:05:43.889> with<00:05:43.919> just

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.749 
great and good for coming away with just

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
say that I don't know about so in

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.770
