gear for the setup of the laptop and and
the<00:00:42.070> live<00:00:42.489> feed<00:00:42.910> which<00:00:43.150> requires<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.720> antenna

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
the live feed which requires the antenna

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.880 
the live feed which requires the antenna
and<00:00:44.320> I'll<00:00:45.160> typically<00:00:45.670> set<00:00:45.850> up<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.000> laptop<00:00:46.450> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and I'll typically set up a laptop and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.590 
and I'll typically set up a laptop and
have<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.040> live<00:00:48.220> feed<00:00:48.489> running<00:00:48.910> connect<00:00:49.510> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
have the live feed running connect the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.390 
have the live feed running connect the
antenna<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.260> I<00:00:50.290> picks<00:00:50.530> up<00:00:50.680> all<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.040> units

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
antenna so that I picks up all the units

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.439 
antenna so that I picks up all the units
that<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.580> players<00:00:51.790> are<00:00:51.940> wearing<00:00:52.059> as<00:00:52.330> the

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
that the players are wearing as the

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.119 
that the players are wearing as the
inter<00:00:52.629> onto<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.930> pitch<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.379> then<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:54.010> will

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
inter onto the pitch and then that will

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.229 
inter onto the pitch and then that will
just<00:00:54.250> allow<00:00:54.550> us<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.790> do<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:55.030> real-time

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
just allow us to do the real-time

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.899 
just allow us to do the real-time
analysis<00:00:56.050> as<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.230> play<00:00:56.589> is<00:00:56.730> happening<00:00:57.730> on<00:00:57.820> the

pitch

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
pitch
there<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:00.989> distinct<00:01:01.320> differences

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
there was two distinct differences

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.490 
there was two distinct differences
between<00:01:01.879> lifetime<00:01:02.879> analysis<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> downloaded

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
between lifetime analysis and downloaded

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
between lifetime analysis and downloaded
analysis<00:01:04.979> once<00:01:05.190> once<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> session<00:01:05.909> is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
analysis once once the session is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
analysis once once the session is
completed<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.720> what's<00:01:07.470> involved<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.920> there

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
completed and what's involved was there

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.950 
completed and what's involved was there
was<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.340> awful<00:01:08.460> lot<00:01:08.700> more<00:01:08.729> variables<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
was just an awful lot more variables to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
was just an awful lot more variables to
be<00:01:09.990> looked<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.470> once<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.009> downloaded<00:01:11.220> fully

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
be looked at once it's downloaded fully

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.310 
be looked at once it's downloaded fully
and<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.450> due<00:01:12.630> mainly<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> fact<00:01:13.259> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and that's due mainly to the fact that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
and that's due mainly to the fact that
you<00:01:13.440> can't<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.520> variables

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you can't see some of those variables

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
you can't see some of those variables
when<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> live<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.780> running<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> pitch

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
but the live ones themselves give you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
but the live ones themselves give you
very<00:01:18.509> general<00:01:18.960> indicator<00:01:19.320> stalls<00:01:19.649> for<00:01:19.799> what's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and in that sense we can make sure that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.809 
and in that sense we can make sure that
the<00:01:55.110> training<00:01:55.350> isn't<00:01:55.619> overloading<00:01:56.490> one

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
the training isn't overloading one

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.639 
the training isn't overloading one
player<00:01:57.090> particularly<00:01:57.720> against<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
player particularly against all the

so<00:02:03.130> yeah<00:02:03.280> there's<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.549> lot<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.790> benefits<00:02:04.180> from

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so yeah there's a lot of benefits from

so yeah there's a lot of benefits from
obviously<00:02:04.810> there's<00:02:05.320> very<00:02:05.530> individual

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
obviously there's very individual

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.950 
obviously there's very individual
profiles<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.939> all<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.210> players<00:02:07.420> based<00:02:07.750> on

profiles of all the players based on
where<00:02:08.110> they<00:02:08.259> play<00:02:08.470> obviously<00:02:09.009> our<00:02:09.160> back<00:02:09.340> three

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
where they play obviously our back three

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.100 
where they play obviously our back three
players<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.060> quite<00:02:10.209> quick<00:02:10.479> they'll<00:02:10.720> cover<00:02:10.869> an

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
players are quite quick they'll cover an

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.690 
players are quite quick they'll cover an
awful<00:02:11.350> lot<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.470> high<00:02:11.680> speed<00:02:11.950> running<00:02:12.310> distance

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
awful lot of high speed running distance

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.580 
awful lot of high speed running distance
an<00:02:12.910> awful<00:02:13.600> lot<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.720> Sprint's<00:02:14.110> within<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.410> game

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
an awful lot of Sprint's within the game

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.979 
an awful lot of Sprint's within the game
typically<00:02:15.340> your<00:02:16.000> back<00:02:16.239> roll<00:02:16.480> forwards<00:02:16.900> will

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
typically your back roll forwards will

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.360 
typically your back roll forwards will
go<00:02:17.140> through<00:02:17.290> an<00:02:17.410> awful<00:02:17.680> amount<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.980> contacts

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
go through an awful amount of contacts

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.190 
go through an awful amount of contacts
and<00:02:18.489> all<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.180> analyzed<00:02:19.600> by<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> system

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and all that is analyzed by the system

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840 
and all that is analyzed by the system
as<00:02:20.319> well<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:21.310> see<00:02:21.520> all<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> this

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
as well and that you can see all of this

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 
as well and that you can see all of this
occurring<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.170> means<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
occurring but what that means when the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.710 
occurring but what that means when the
session<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.550> running<00:02:24.880> live<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.450> training

session or analyzing after a match we
can<00:02:28.239> see<00:02:28.420> how<00:02:28.600> each<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.260> players<00:02:29.470> compare

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
can see how each of the players compare

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830 
can see how each of the players compare
not<00:02:30.130> only<00:02:30.430> against<00:02:30.970> themselves<00:02:31.120> from<00:02:31.480> game<00:02:31.690> to
