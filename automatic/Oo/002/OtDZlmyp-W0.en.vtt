00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi my spirit how are you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome this new video in this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 I will show you how to record the video 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.860
 screen of your android phones 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.380
 for this we are going to make use of a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 application called screencast video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 recorder pro and the download link of the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 ape cacaraqueada will be in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.949
 description of the video we will see the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.949
 application 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.039
 as you can see this is the application 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.410
 as you can see I'm recording 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.250
 currently the video that's why it marks me 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 this red button so good for 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.610
 start recording you just have to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 press this button and I'll start 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.210
 to record the video 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.519
 Now I'm going to show you the options 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 the application to you the 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.710
 you can configure this the best 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.360
 quality is also here on video 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.510
 resolution obviously you have to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.510
 put in height or high you put there 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.059
 here in the rotation you put it in rotation 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 here in frames for second 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.690
 as you came in 21 there are as is here 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.690
 in timelapse then you will leave it as 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.420
 is because this is the speed of the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.940
 video leave it as it is here then 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.580
 possible you can follow a pointer but 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.400
 this is going to slow down a little more the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.410
 video so 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.040
 if you do not have a high-end phone, 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.560
 we recommend that you put it here you can 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 modify the name of the video and here 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 you put these options to your liking 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.130
 This will capture the screen or be 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.219
 to be screenshots I use screen 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.670
 as the mayor did this I have not moved 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.350
 so here you are seeing how it is 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.369
 this is the only thing that you can configure is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.340
 this to put in jp here the rest what 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.860
 I leave like him and this is all here has a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.000
 benchmark which is a test in which 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.049
 lets you know this how many 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.590
 this how many frames goes your 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.970
 phone 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.190
 in this case mine only goes to 17.6 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.519
 but good is very little but good 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.879
 is something 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.129
 and good has also a widget included 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.950
 which is the one that you are seeing that is at 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.860
 side of the search bar is the one that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.050
 is red is the widget for 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.760
 for the home screen which you 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.520
 allows you to record directly only with a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.070
 touch that is very good so good 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 basically this is all about 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.720
 record the screen of your phones 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.450
 so good if you liked the video 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.580

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.790
