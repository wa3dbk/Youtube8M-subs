00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
bit with the easier one again just small

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
bit with the easier one again just small
circular<00:00:46.050> motions<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> blend<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
circular motions to kind of blend the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
circular motions to kind of blend the
colors<00:00:47.730> together<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> super<00:00:50.910> simple<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:51.629> not

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
too worried about going outside the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.209 
too worried about going outside the
lines<00:00:54.210> cuz<00:00:54.449> i<00:00:54.539> plan<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.780> cutting<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.980> image

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
are 23 and I'm just using like a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
are 23 and I'm just using like a
flicking<00:01:30.990> motion<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.470> pulling<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> color

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
flicking motion like pulling the color

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
flicking motion like pulling the color
towards<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.520> flicking<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> away<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.479> me

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
towards me or flicking it away from me

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.830 
towards me or flicking it away from me
and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.610> wire<00:01:35.909> 27<00:01:36.750> which

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and then going in with my wire 27 which

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740 
and then going in with my wire 27 which
is<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.110> darkest<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> once<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.180> got<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> then

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is my darkest so once I've got that then

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
is my darkest so once I've got that then
I<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.770> wire<00:01:41.070> 23<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.939> middle

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I go back in with my wire 23 my middle

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
I go back in with my wire 23 my middle
color<00:01:42.439> just<00:01:43.439> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> add<00:01:43.829> some<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
color just kind of add some more and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.770 
color just kind of add some more and
kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.729> pulling<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> middle

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
kind of pulling it more into the middle

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
kind of pulling it more into the middle
and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:47.130> wire<00:01:47.340> 31<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.210> lightest

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and then my wire 31 which is my lightest

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.569 
and then my wire 31 which is my lightest
and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.049> finally<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.250> wire

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and then finally going back with my wire

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
and then finally going back with my wire
27<00:01:51.299> which<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.540> my<00:01:51.630> darkest<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.380> back

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
it just becomes easy so once I got the

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.219 
it just becomes easy so once I got the
boat<00:04:16.530> I'd<00:04:16.739> trim<00:04:17.370> off<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.820> tails<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.720> then

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
shift it over to the side and then I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.220 
shift it over to the side and then I
wanted<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.169> pop<00:04:22.409> pop<00:04:23.219> little<00:04:23.639> Emma<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.120> on

she's all done and then for the
sentiment<00:04:36.540> i<00:04:36.690> chose<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.380> sentiment<00:04:37.770> from<00:04:37.950> my

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
