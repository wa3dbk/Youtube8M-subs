00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:44.770
 Iron What is one thing I 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 frighten of everything well here is a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 book of scary stories long ago i 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.230
 dragons were considered the most beings 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.350
 fearsome but then discovered that everything is not 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.300
 they were so clumsy for today 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.000
 fear but then realized they were 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.119
 harmless to meet witches at night 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.590
 vultures is not pleasant but here's the thing 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:12.490
 more horrifying mad polluter no 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.740
 really 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 but look at how it changes when sitting at 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.780
 car wheel then comes 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 taken from an irrepressible craving of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:29.920
 get noticed by people especially from 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.509
 girls and olivia where they go are standing 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 when they made the distribution of 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:41.140
 brains I say what you try to do 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.220
 clever inspire the wrinkles of the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:50.290
 skin road signs are placed there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 to avoid confusion therefore go 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.460
 studied very carefully 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.350
 stop your impetus never say what to do 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.350
 to those behind 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.640
 you could find yourself a good driver 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:24.230
 always look at all the traffic signs 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:26.630
 that he meets along the idiot way 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.200
 incompetent and you will pay for it 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.430
 public 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.530
 who taught you to drive live 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 well ends is not absolutely 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 unpresentable 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.480
 here is another one that guides following i 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.190
 his thoughts but that give bikes and eni 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 that you know I've never driven in 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.519
 so wrong in my whole life like that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.620
 roma look what happens to this 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.330
 type proceeds to the left lane 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.799
 which should be reserved for 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.660
 overtaking in this way prevents a 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.519
 all the maneuver is the one behind it 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.670
 try to make her move she is convinced 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.420
 to deal with a parrot 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.549
 insolent 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.630
 there is only one thing to do with this 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.440
 guy 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:26.540
 who should believe in people I did not know 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 that she was there and now here are two 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.390
 proud that they are always fighting among each other 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.820
 their 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.820
 the sprinter and if 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.620
 of course a traffic light generally not 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.420
 to the use of reason 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.190
 yet there are a lot more 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.190
 clever of all sprinters 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.910
 I can tell you something doesn't seem so much 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.240
 sly 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.210
 you know I tell you that you have everything right 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.030
 another driver to avoid the tail 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.100
 tore the tour queue and hates to observe the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.080
 Safety distance between if that is what 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.170
 that precedes it and so who is the most 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.360
 as close as possible and when they queue up 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.610
 a whole lot all go together to form 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.980
 a kind of train that is so much more 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.980
 dangerous the stronger they go 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.950
 this because each of them relies on 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.720
 what's ahead and everyone is 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.090
 naturally convinced that mine 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.450
 public is always a born driver 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.370
 awake to the art a prerogative eyewear 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.650
 and born of the head and who deserves the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.330
 applause from his fellow citizens 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.560
 thank you for your adept 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:16.660
 apparently said the la 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:18.250
 long line be a little short I hope 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.900
 to have taught you something good 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.360
 willy 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 whoever bets I'll never turn out but my 35 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.830
 above 200 per hour
