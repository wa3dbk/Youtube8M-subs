to to beat up and roll right off you can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
to to beat up and roll right off you can
even<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.979> through<00:01:47.159> the

talk<00:02:41.220> about<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> heating<00:02:41.790> components<00:02:42.360> from

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
talk about the heating components from

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.070 
talk about the heating components from
gurbin

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
gurbin

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
going to be a high double cord so here's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.330 
going to be a high double cord so here's
your<00:03:00.450> power<00:03:00.630> cord<00:03:00.990> from<00:03:01.470> gurbin<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.250> I'm

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
your power cord from gurbin what I'm

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
your power cord from gurbin what I'm
gonna<00:03:02.460> do<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:02.940> gonna<00:03:03.030> slide<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
gonna do is I'm gonna slide in that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
gonna do is I'm gonna slide in that
power<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.830> goes<00:03:04.980> into<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> other<00:03:05.430> side

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
power up it goes into the other side

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.550 
power up it goes into the other side
there<00:03:05.940> there's<00:03:06.540> only<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.930> way<00:03:07.080> for<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.410> go

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
there there's only one way for it to go

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.650 
there there's only one way for it to go
so<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:07.860> very<00:03:08.310> simple<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.000> its<00:03:09.150> design<00:03:09.420> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
so it's very simple in its design and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.550 
so it's very simple in its design and
what<00:03:09.960> you're<00:03:10.050> gonna<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.410> you're<00:03:10.500> gonna

what you're gonna do is you're gonna
turn<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.250> remember<00:03:11.490> there's<00:03:11.640> four

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
turn it on I remember there's four

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.340 
turn it on I remember there's four
settings<00:03:12.360> here<00:03:12.600> we<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.960> guy<00:03:13.110> fully

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
settings here we have this guy fully

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.320 
settings here we have this guy fully
charged<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.070> turn<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.760> when<00:03:15.210> it's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
charged so I turn it on and when it's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.540 
charged so I turn it on and when it's
1/8<00:03:15.690> when<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.290> goes<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.440> 4<00:03:16.770> bars<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.280> gonna<00:03:17.430> go

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
1/8 when it goes to 4 bars it's gonna go

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.330 
1/8 when it goes to 4 bars it's gonna go
from<00:03:17.760> 0<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.150> 135<00:03:19.020> degrees<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.440> about<00:03:19.680> 4<00:03:19.920> seconds

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
from 0 to 135 degrees in about 4 seconds

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.190 
from 0 to 135 degrees in about 4 seconds
and<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.760> uses<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> proprietary<00:03:21.750> Urban's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and it uses the proprietary Urban's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.880 
and it uses the proprietary Urban's

stainless steel almost bundles of thread

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.090 
stainless steel almost bundles of thread
that<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:27.989> flexible<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.680> don't<00:03:28.860> feel

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
that are flexible that you don't feel

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.860 
that are flexible that you don't feel

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
but get hot very quickly again when I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.240 
but get hot very quickly again when I
say<00:03:31.050> hot<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.380> relative<00:03:31.770> it's<00:03:31.890> not<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.190> to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
beauty of this is if I do that I'll get

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.030 
beauty of this is if I do that I'll get
about<00:03:36.480> 2<00:03:36.660> hours<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.140> output<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.860> can

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
about 2 hours of output but I can

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.330 
about 2 hours of output but I can
ratchet<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.610> by<00:03:38.940> 75%<00:03:39.630> 50%<00:03:40.110> all<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> way<00:03:41.220> down

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
ratchet down by 75% 50% all the way down

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.460 
ratchet down by 75% 50% all the way down
to<00:03:41.489> 25%<00:03:41.910> output<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> when<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
to 25% output and when I do that the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.260 
to 25% output and when I do that the
heat<00:03:43.739> level<00:03:43.950> goes<00:03:44.160> down<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.670> length<00:03:45.060> of

heat level goes down but the length of

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.430 
heat level goes down but the length of
time<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.510> get<00:03:45.720> out<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.989> battery<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
time you get out of the battery is

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.770 
time you get out of the battery is
absolutely<00:03:47.190> going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.060> at<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
absolutely going to go up so at the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.810 
absolutely going to go up so at the
lowest<00:03:49.080> setting<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.440> gonna<00:03:49.560> get<00:03:49.709> 8<00:03:49.920> hours<00:03:50.580> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
lowest setting I'm gonna get 8 hours a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.150 
lowest setting I'm gonna get 8 hours a
full<00:03:51.209> 8<00:03:51.390> hours<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.959> heat<00:03:52.260> continuously<00:03:52.890> at<00:03:53.100> a

full 8 hours of heat continuously at a
lower<00:03:53.730> temperature<00:03:54.030> range<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.870> going<00:03:55.140> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
lower temperature range that's going to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.960 
lower temperature range that's going to
be<00:03:55.320> output<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.830> again<00:03:56.070> depending<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.820> if

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
be output so again depending on if

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.250 
be output so again depending on if
you're<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.360> bike<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:57.660> off<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> bike<00:03:58.080> and

you're on the bike or off the bike and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.900 
you're on the bike or off the bike and
turning<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.680> off<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.280> simple<00:03:59.610> but

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
turning it off really that simple but

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.220 
turning it off really that simple but
