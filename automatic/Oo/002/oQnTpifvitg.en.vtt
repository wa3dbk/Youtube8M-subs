00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
extra light so here we are this is just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.200 
extra light so here we are this is just
a<00:02:13.990> low<00:02:14.950> B<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.460> auxillary<00:02:15.730> lights<00:02:16.030> I've

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
a low B with the auxillary lights I've

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.330 
a low B with the auxillary lights I've
turned<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> very<00:02:16.720> lights<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.340> slow

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
beam just nowhere near as much like this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.820 
beam just nowhere near as much like this
with<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> auxiliaries<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.530> gives<00:02:23.710> you

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
with the auxiliaries on this gives you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.590 

in<00:02:30.500> fact<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.830> put<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.040> up<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.130> fall<00:02:31.400> beam<00:02:31.610> there

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
in fact I put it up to fall beam there

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.690 
in fact I put it up to fall beam there
you<00:02:32.690> go<00:02:32.810> okay<00:02:33.740> makes<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.190> gives<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.580> bit<00:02:34.670> of

for a motorcycle is quite remarkable we

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.880 
for a motorcycle is quite remarkable we
just<00:02:51.820> turn<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:51.970> high<00:02:52.150> beam<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.510> again<00:02:52.890> there

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
just turn the high beam up again there

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.230 
just turn the high beam up again there
we<00:02:53.950> go<00:02:54.100> not<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.790> much<00:02:55.000> difference<00:02:55.920> brilliant

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
we go not that much difference brilliant

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.390 
we go not that much difference brilliant

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
so let's just do a little test then I'm

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.710 
so let's just do a little test then I'm
sitting<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> bike<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> fairly<00:03:13.570> dark

sitting on the bike in a fairly dark

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720 
sitting on the bike in a fairly dark
lay-by<00:03:14.130> hopefully<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.340> see<00:03:15.550> what<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
lay-by hopefully you can see what the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.890 
lay-by hopefully you can see what the
lights<00:03:15.910> look<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.090> from<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.390> front<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.750> well

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
lights look like from the front as well

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.830 
lights look like from the front as well
as<00:03:17.140> from<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:17.740> seated<00:03:18.160> position<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:19.600> wait

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
as from my seated position we just wait

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.540 
as from my seated position we just wait
for<00:03:19.870> these<00:03:20.050> cars<00:03:20.320> go<00:03:20.590> by<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.010> upset<00:03:21.280> me<00:03:21.370> test

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
for these cars go by and upset me test

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.710 
for these cars go by and upset me test
too<00:03:21.670> much<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.390> we're<00:03:22.480> looking<00:03:22.660> at

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
too much but this what we're looking at

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.100 
too much but this what we're looking at
now<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.230> normal<00:03:23.470> dipped<00:03:24.040> headlight<00:03:25.110> okay

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
now is just normal dipped headlight okay

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.620 
now is just normal dipped headlight okay
if<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.530> go<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.710> full<00:03:27.160> beam<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:28.240> looks<00:03:28.450> like

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
if I go to full beam that looks like

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.500 
if I go to full beam that looks like
that<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.350> gives<00:03:29.500> us<00:03:29.650> longer<00:03:29.920> throw<00:03:30.510> let's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
that it gives us longer throw let's

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.090 
that it gives us longer throw let's
bring<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> full<00:03:31.930> beam<00:03:32.050> off<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.560> then<00:03:32.920> we'll

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
bring the full beam off and then we'll

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.880 
bring the full beam off and then we'll
go<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.250> auxilary<00:03:33.880> lights<00:03:34.120> on<00:03:34.330> as<00:03:34.480> well<00:03:34.890> there

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
go to auxilary lights on as well there

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.620 
go to auxilary lights on as well there
we<00:03:35.950> go<00:03:36.070> that's<00:03:36.400> auxilary<00:03:36.790> lights<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.210> see<00:03:37.570> it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
we go that's auxilary lights on see it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.200 
we go that's auxilary lights on see it
gives<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> further<00:03:38.350> beam<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.550> like

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
gives you a further beam and it I like

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.520 
gives you a further beam and it I like
is<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.360> quite<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> lot<00:03:40.780> wider<00:03:40.960> sort<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.380> off

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
is you quite a lot wider sort it off

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.820 
is you quite a lot wider sort it off
that's<00:03:42.460> normal<00:03:42.790> dip<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.440> that's<00:03:44.620> with<00:03:44.740> the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
that's normal dip and that's with the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's normal dip and that's with the
auxiliary<00:03:45.190> lights<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.520> then<00:03:45.610> with<00:03:45.760> full<00:03:45.940> beam

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
auxiliary lights and then with full beam

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.750 
auxiliary lights and then with full beam
as<00:03:46.240> well<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:47.860> find<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.190> button<00:03:48.370> there<00:03:48.670> we

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
as well I can find the button there we

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.540 
as well I can find the button there we
go<00:03:49.080> full<00:03:50.080> beam<00:03:50.320> as<00:03:50.560> well<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.830> also<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.400> red

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
go full beam as well as also the red

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.420 
go full beam as well as also the red
lights<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:53.170> all<00:03:53.650> together<00:03:53.710> much<00:03:54.010> better<00:03:54.040> so

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
lights so all together much better so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.420 
lights so all together much better so
full<00:03:54.670> beam<00:03:54.820> off<00:03:55.410> that's<00:03:56.410> walks<00:03:56.950> really<00:03:57.280> lights
