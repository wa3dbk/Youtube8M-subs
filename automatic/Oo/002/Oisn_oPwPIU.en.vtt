00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.792
And they are getting the next song ready...
End

00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:02.992
Huh? You stopped it.

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:05.582
Stop button

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:09.582
Uh, what do I do?

00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:15.172
They were enjoying the song,
but then this happens!

00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:15.952
What was that?

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:17.712
Mike, mike!

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:22.692
This song... Is this how it is?

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.722
He pressed

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:29.222
the stop button by mistake...

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:34.292
And it caused a super awkward silence

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:36.792
Turn the mike back on.

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:38.742
In a hurry

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:40.732
I actually...

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:42.942
His hand is shaking again

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.382
Turned the CD off

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:47.722
by accident.

00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:50.262
He sounds so innocent

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:51.752
What a shock! I was wondering what happened.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.502
My heart was pounding.

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:55.542
I apologize.

00:00:55.542 --> 00:01:00.612
I was switching some CDs,

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:01.632
and I turned it off.

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:04.982
I'm sorry! I'll play it again!

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:07.622
Pharrell... Pharrae ???

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.162
Let's hear it again.

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:14.592
Pharrell Williams' Happy.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.482
I'm doomed!

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:22.992
It was 1 minute! 1 minute!

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:27.792
Of course he'd be surprised.
The song just stopped in the middle!

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:30.322
I do that a lot.

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:33.082
August 25, Bae Cheolsu's Music Camp

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:35.442
The song ended

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:38.502
I'm sorry, the CD just...

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:41.322
It's because I pressed the wrong button.

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:45.282
Let's listen to it again.
Rixton's "Me and My Broken Heart."

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.392
He apologized and played the song again

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:51.972
Mr. Bae did this too, in the past.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:53.942
So don't let this discourage you!

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:57.882
Director, you're Hiddink of radio shows!

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.552
Be confident.

00:02:00.122 --> 00:02:02.782
I'm ruined! I knew this would happen!

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:06.712
Why did I press that?

00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:08.722
But you recovered from it very well.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.632
Oh, I'm crushed.

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:14.622
Worried
Hyeongdon will be fine, right?

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:17.022
I feel like my face is going to explode.

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:18.912
No, everyone does that.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:20.212
Hyeongdon,

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:22.542
move with the rhythm.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.812
Hyeongdon, try to relax your body. It's okay.

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.152
Coach Hiddink says it's okay.

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:29.182
Dance in there.

00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:31.912
Can he do it?

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:38.662
I'm sorry, Mr. Pharrell Winim...

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:41.352
He can't pronounce Pharrell Williams's name.

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:44.792
That is funny. It's fun.

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:46.332
I like things like this.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.062
I'm very sorry.

00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:50.242
So many people are posting...

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.252
"LOL" on the bulletin board.

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:56.262
Since this is my first and last radio show,

00:02:56.262 --> 00:02:58.072
I'm going to try to relax a little.

00:02:58.072 --> 00:02:59.842
The song I have for you next is...

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.322
- He's gotten so much better.
- Didn't he?

00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:03.672
He made that big mistake, and now he's
letting it go.
