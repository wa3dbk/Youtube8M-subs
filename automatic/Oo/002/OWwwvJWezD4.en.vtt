00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.040
 So she is ready this was 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.919
 which is scored 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.919
 and Dr 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 to go his own way 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 further actions against the system convinced 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 twice 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 March was a time before that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.250
 Improvement is 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 the brand new one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 now it is not only expensive but it is 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 and that is the jubilation 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.330
 not their dominance were played out 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.430
 not with spectacular football 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 but with a lot of possession until 7 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.120
 but this game is not 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.430
 the big advantage over 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 he is now 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.040
 here again the gate 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 first goal shake 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.160
 Class single action by Arjen Robben of the subsequent life 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.090
 yellow card for this action 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.350
 and 2 the reading 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 Take off the jersey 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 for the cup-fight 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.130
 Rösli was broken in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 but I want to be here he is the impartial 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.169
 Do you want to go again? 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.159
 this beautiful gate 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.340
 No fantastic does she want on this attitude I do not rule out 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.949
 in the extension 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.479
 Jasmund 70 14 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.479
 been provided at the new service 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 In the trade is as he is 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.999
 dixi toilets before 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.599
 WebTrends 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.599
 and something would wait as well 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.119
 by Patrick Beuth Youth Forces 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.119
 Pauli Theater in front of Thomas Müller 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.759
 also the over the entire season 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.479
 on the field 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 and that matters as much as the bones do that now 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.619
 so profitable was given the future tasks next 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.009
 yes against Stuttgart 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.459
 if you then Schalke then again menu and then in Leverkusen 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.459
 that's it 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.879
 so I would but it is in July for Lebedev Bastian Schweinsteiger 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.410
 at least have to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 Munich - must
