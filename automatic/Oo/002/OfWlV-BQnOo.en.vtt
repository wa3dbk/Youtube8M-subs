00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 Hello 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.250
 the step by step today is a box of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 mdf very different because it will have you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.289
 hot glue there we will use the first 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 to color the hot glue but the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 The result of it is very handsome then hands 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 work 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 so the first thing I did was 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.680
 give two coats of powdered paint in color 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 mineral 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.219
 so give a piece of sandpaper and go through 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.129
 another hand there what I did is already have a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 video here on the channel that is the butterfly 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 with glitter here in this case a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.809
 birdie with the use of the stencil 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.329
 I applied with the fixed glitter the glitter 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 in the little bird and then we'll go 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.350
 do the part 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 then it's simple just to scratch as 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 were the branches of a tree and you 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.549
 risk as you wish 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 It's a pencil as a pisei was and will 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.860
 making bottlenecks as you want 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.630
 nothing too true 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.990
 It is to the detail that you have to do 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.420
 besides up here on the lid here to 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.840
 that it looks beautiful stays one thing only then 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.540
 You're going to go down the lid and go this way. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.040
 and then you'll just draw branches from 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.979
 Any way you want it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.670
 after you've drawn everyone there 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.399
 will use hot glue on top of where 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.280
 you risk or it's simple on top of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.850
 Where did you go? 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.850
 hot 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.660
 and this you will do in the whole play 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.100
 After it cools well there you 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.170
 take all her little children away 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.840
 a very beautiful finish 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.500
 here I already have a piece of glue that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.020
 It's already cold and here I've already passed it to me. 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.050
 to pass first is very simple 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.950
 can be any brand was a little bit 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:33.730
 on a tray with a little pot 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:35.860
 a little he gives a brush a lot 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.450
 thin can be those of cable 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.160
 even though you will make a 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 look at the brush and go over the glue 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.519
 hot but try not to go all the same 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.489
 leaving the faults a marks one 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:02.650
 bit without passing that is to 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:05.110
 give the piece more realism because no 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.870
 tree branch is all the same like some are 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.690
 more lightblue darker ones 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.630
 after the prime ck it takes sim 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.000
 About ten minutes is very fast too. 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.850
 then we'll use a little bit of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.220
 pva also light brown same 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.610
 thing, but a tray with a brush without 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.709
 the thinner cable may be yellow after 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.090
 that the first c co 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.350
 Then you give the ink a powder then with 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.000
 caution 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:44.370
 just over where you passed the first 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.680
 no, do not carry too much paintbrush 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.630
 of a coat if it is necessary to give more 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.510
 one but fails to look beautiful and 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.440
 so you will make the play all of it 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.440
 it will stay like this 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.000
 It's going to look like this so I did it on the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.190
 front and part of the sides as 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.810
 in that there and there I adorned with these is 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.359
 I used this flower 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.050
 five petals these little flower 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.290
 flowers are fabric is the fabric and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.200
 Satin gummed it to him right in cuts 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.419
 is this fabric is good because it is a 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.750
 fabric it has a width of 1 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.140
 A meter and a half is an inexpensive one 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.100
 metro can do a lot of much flower 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.430
 and then I faced the little boy with these 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.460
 those traits of self adhesive stickers 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:59.790
 and then just glue with ordinary white glue 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:05:05.100
 to decorate paste two more here one 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:09.919
 bit the glue goes with the brush 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.919
 also thin to exaggerate in the glue 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.320
 and then you'll get it right where you want 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.360
 I'm going to put one more here, a little 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.530
 cola super good too 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.020
 But you have to have a little bit of 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.020
 patience roll over one 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.060
 living here 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.120
 and you get a very different box and 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.120
 Very pretty 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.890
 I hope you liked it, I do not know 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.980
 forget to give a jewel and sign up 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.940
 on the channel to receive the updates 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.940
 kisses and until the next
