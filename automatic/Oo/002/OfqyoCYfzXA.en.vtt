00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello everyone, this is the day's distribution 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.260
 pakistan and sergey swan themselves 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.480
 today our hero distributed one 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.769
 suffered the king 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.929
 position of the small blind but apparently from 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.999
 Opponent from the position of MP decide tempered 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.849
 yes such a joke it takes place to be but 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.640
 naturally before doing similar 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029
 cola disposition should be darker 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 clear frost plan 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.170
 the flop of a gram hit this pair 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.600
 opponent will become quite expected kombat 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.920
 and our hero sets off his rice 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.700
 let's stop at this place 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.280
 and try in more detail 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.080
 situation development 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.060
 we must remember so our opponent 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.080
 opened from positions MP 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.790
 so by definition empire 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 East will have many more hands 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 dominate our 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660
 payments we got into a good combination and 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.860
 we expect opponents from 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.370
 rearrange comeback 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.070
 like terms that are well hooked for 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.700
 outboard who nominate us 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.590
 hockey with hands against which we 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.450
 but they would still become a combat officer so 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.250
 suitable cup 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.230
 the game we make such a rice we achieve 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.690
 just that the vessels receive the spectrum 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.140
 price exhibitors will reset 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.460
 won't keep only this part against 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.500
 which we are behind 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.290
 walking in essence is meaningless 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.190
 and often lead our 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.500
 P 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 chip strength 12 each 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.450
 we had to do the floor here being in 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 situations far behind far ahead 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 would walk start 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.140
 panetta lira kingdom floor 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.950
 and we leave on the subject already being 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 elevated baku cans 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.500
 Nasser goes ii a dozen what else 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 more increase the amount of batter 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.530
 opponent's pipe spectrum 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 and after expansion dad bridge enter 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.480
 we get the answer they are thieves there 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.380
 forget that people we need to understand that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.330
 our current combination 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.190
 in number is here a loan against 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.949
 opponent's spectrum 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.249
 but we also got a straight draw and 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:11.920
 chances 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 we can colleague tokumen rice 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.499
 mottaki act 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.209
 trust us nothing closed i and proceeding 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.040
 from the hall of our previous 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.019
 logical reasoning and here 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.019
 we must play cover 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.499
 the hero cannot part with his 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.629
 on the street 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.829
 loses 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.479
 this bank 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.439
 but about compliance with article 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.510
 so here when we go dispositions with 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.819
 similar hands in all productions themselves 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.209
 parts of the position 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.069
 we need to keep everything in mind 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.019
 what I talked about on previous versions 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.309
 and in no case replay 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.469
 similar hands 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.909
 otherwise we will often just hammer piles 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.009
 it is necessary to recoup to find exactly 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.909
 month 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.379
 for the time being means to lose no life
