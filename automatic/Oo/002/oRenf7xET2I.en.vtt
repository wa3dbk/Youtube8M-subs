the<00:01:22.460> man<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.759> aim<00:01:22.909> for<00:01:23.049> it's<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.170> home<00:01:24.350> game

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the man to aim for it's a home game

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.680 
the man to aim for it's a home game
against<00:01:25.070> Aston<00:01:25.369> Villa<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.909> on<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.509> back<00:01:26.659> of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
against Aston Villa and on the back of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.870 
against Aston Villa and on the back of
their<00:01:26.960> three<00:01:27.259> nil<00:01:27.440> away<00:01:27.710> win<00:01:27.920> against<00:01:28.310> Spurs<00:01:28.610> I

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
their three nil away win against Spurs I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.130 
their three nil away win against Spurs I
think<00:01:29.270> Liverpool<00:01:29.390> will<00:01:29.750> be<00:01:29.840> full<00:01:30.049> of

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
think Liverpool will be full of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.899 
think Liverpool will be full of
confidence<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.770> will<00:01:31.399> get<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.549> good<00:01:31.759> result

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
confidence and will get a good result

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.700 
confidence and will get a good result
again<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.390> week<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.140> think<00:01:33.200> Balotelli

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
again this week and I think Balotelli

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.880 
again this week and I think Balotelli
will<00:01:33.920> be<00:01:34.009> amongst<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.369> points<00:01:35.770> hazard<00:01:36.770> is

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
will be amongst the points hazard is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.190 
will be amongst the points hazard is
next<00:01:37.159> on<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.280> list<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:38.509> could<00:01:38.750> prove<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:38.990> be<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
next on the list it could prove to be a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.320 
next on the list it could prove to be a
big<00:01:39.409> game<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.710> weekend<00:01:40.039> for<00:01:40.159> Chelsea<00:01:40.550> either

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
big game this weekend for Chelsea either

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.820 
big game this weekend for Chelsea either
Swansea<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:41.899> themselves<00:01:42.289> will<00:01:42.470> drop<00:01:42.679> their

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
Swansea or themselves will drop their

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.590 
Swansea or themselves will drop their
first<00:01:43.009> points<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.550> season<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.149> both

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
first points of the season and both

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.760 
first points of the season and both
teams<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.929> been<00:01:45.020> looking<00:01:45.289> great<00:01:45.530> going

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
teams have been looking great going

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.950 
teams have been looking great going
forward<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.250> far<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.210> think<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.539> could<00:01:47.750> be<00:01:47.869> in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
forward so far so I think we could be in

one<00:01:58.700> game<00:01:58.909> week<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.750> maybe<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.229> could<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
potential primarily comes from him being

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.130 
potential primarily comes from him being
a<00:02:45.739> nailed<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.459> four<00:02:46.760> million<00:02:46.939> defender<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:48.079> I

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
a nailed on four million defender but I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.600 
a nailed on four million defender but I
was<00:02:48.290> impressed<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.099> other<00:02:49.250> week<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
was impressed with in the other week and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.309 
was impressed with in the other week and
impressed<00:02:50.269> with<00:02:50.390> Bernie's<00:02:50.750> performance<00:02:51.200> in

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
impressed with Bernie's performance in

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.080 
impressed with Bernie's performance in
general<00:02:51.680> against<00:02:51.980> money<00:02:52.189> knighted<00:02:52.549> so<00:02:53.060> I

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
general against money knighted so I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.580 
general against money knighted so I
think<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.450> worth<00:02:53.569> taking<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.019> look<00:02:54.110> at<00:02:54.409> duff

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
think it's worth taking a look at duff

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.520 
think it's worth taking a look at duff
this<00:02:54.769> weekend<00:02:55.150> he's<00:02:56.150> away<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> Palace<00:02:56.959> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
this weekend he's away to Palace so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.800 
this weekend he's away to Palace so
clean<00:02:57.829> she<00:02:58.010> isn't<00:02:58.370> too<00:02:58.549> unlikely<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.269> to

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
clean she isn't too unlikely and to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.929 
clean she isn't too unlikely and to
follow<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.200> he<00:03:00.530> has<00:03:00.769> Sunderland<00:03:01.400> West<00:03:01.640> Brom

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
follow that he has Sunderland West Brom

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.780 
follow that he has Sunderland West Brom
Lester<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.870> West<00:03:03.200> Ham<00:03:03.439> so<00:03:04.250> there<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.519> decent

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
Lester and West Ham so there is a decent

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.190 
Lester and West Ham so there is a decent
chance<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.299> some<00:03:05.420> clean<00:03:05.599> sheets<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.959> there

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
chance of some clean sheets in there

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.380 
chance of some clean sheets in there
obviously<00:03:06.799> at<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.519> price<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.030> don't<00:03:08.209> expect

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
obviously at is price you don't expect

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.479 
obviously at is price you don't expect
too<00:03:08.689> much<00:03:08.840> from<00:03:08.900> him<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:10.040> certainly<00:03:10.340> for

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
too much from him but certainly for

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.039 
too much from him but certainly for
people<00:03:10.549> on<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:10.879> wild<00:03:11.180> card<00:03:11.359> he<00:03:11.810> could<00:03:11.959> be<00:03:12.019> a

people on a wild card he could be a

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.080 
people on a wild card he could be a
great<00:03:12.230> squad<00:03:12.530> player<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.129> will<00:03:13.730> help<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.060> keep
