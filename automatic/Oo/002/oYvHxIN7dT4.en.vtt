00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.400
 pretty very dice to a good new video 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 about 728 and now much 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.269
 people are having problems for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.950
 connect to the network pressure and good 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.869
 I suppose not be long before 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.030
 fix it and two because it's what this 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.680
 floor is probably why I'm going to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 explain to later but good if you're 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.200
 connected and it works perfectly what 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.610
 the best you can do is not 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.260
 disconnect from continue to suppose that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.180
 playing because when I restart it is 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.370
 it probably does not work for you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 going around the world to some yes to 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.090
 others not as always do not go to me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 put the comments so it's not going to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.030
 do not know that if you go down but to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.260
 many people were better not and that's it 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.730
 well this probably because of the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.110
 update this morning I do not know if 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.220
 you remember that it is a video before in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 how good it seems that who has 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.850
 updated this morning the console 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 that was not mandatory mandatory is a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.590
 this update as the people who 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 had another hard drive that was not the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 original playstation 3 that had it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.070
 changed because he was fucked the play by 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.690
 say some way not in what happened 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.719
 is that it did not load when restarting the play 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 so the wallpaper was left and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.229
 nothing more and some people who neither has 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 modified the hard drive because also the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.159
 passed hand 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 every case was not a very very percentage 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.399
 high but yes they were by a percentage 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 important of the people that is the garlic 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:17.549
 I say this, you have to play the game 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.720
 in that state you can not really do 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.369
 nothing is not the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 a recovery and I know a lot of people that what 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 I try to do and it does not stay 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.420
 likewise the screen with what then 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.340
 I do not know if they will be trying to update 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 the console without having to download 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520
 no patch for the person who is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.539
 the people who are passing this fault 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
 or what is happening 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.830
 It is surely because of this to find out 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 a little to see what has happened 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.009
 with this update and try 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.630
 fix it with what 4 good 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.640
 do not worry, it 's all basically 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.799
 for people who have had the failures 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 with precision surely they have not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.209
 they have not yet posted it on twitter 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.630
 official playstation europe I go to 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.460
 authorize to see what puts something 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.960
 we are updating we still do not put 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.880
 nothing with good bodies because it will be 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.829
 It will be for that reason with which good 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 you worry we will see and see you 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.420
