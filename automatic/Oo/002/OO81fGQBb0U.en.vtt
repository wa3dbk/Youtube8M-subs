00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.290
 So far we make direct contact in 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.090
 quito ecuador with blasco peñaherrera 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.980
 So he is president of the chamber of 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.780
 trade and the national federation of 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.280
 Chambers of Commerce of Ecuador Mr. 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.360
 peñaherrera very good afternoon many 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.839
 thank you for joining us here in the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.839
 informative 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.080
 and we have heard the statements not 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.390
 only of the last hours but of the 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.430
 last weeks of the reelected president 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.900
 from ecuador rafael strap where he said 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.400
 that for four more years he's going to 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.770
 maintain the same political path that has 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.020
 taken so far a plane 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.370
 economic very rescued and highly praised 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 by many media without 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.730
 But they are still blaming the time 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.140
 foreign investment we can expect 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.180
 economically speaking of these 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.130
 next four years of rafael strap to the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.610
 front ecuador 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.630
 and the economic development model 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.490
 raised by the president of the 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.670
 16 year old republic has been a failure 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.000
 and the second failure because in the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.700
 tax revenue is fundamentally 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.750
 due to the high price of oil and 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.630
 tax revenue 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.960
 caused by one for 10 reforms 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.960
 tributaries have failed to revive 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.770
 the Ecuadorian economy and the economy 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 Ecuadorian growth to the average of 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.160
 3.5 percent is almost like the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.990
 vegetative growth and letting see 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.280
 if not then because of these extraordinary 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.810
 income that we have had and by the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.150
 coincidence of people running 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.400
 had to manage a country 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.190
 dollarized despite its opposition to the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170
 dollarization the economic situation of 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.869
 our country would be much more like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.149
 the one from venezuela and the one from argentina without 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.800
 However, what are we going to say 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.289
 let's go to this cell 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.539
 even having extraordinary prices of 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.520
 oil and even having dollars that is 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.890
 this is this simply a handling 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.289
 disoriented from politics as well 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.180
 you manifest there is no investment 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.700
 foreign in our country we have had 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.830
 in the last year 180 million in 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.500
 comparison with colombia that had 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.880
 delivered 6 billion and Peru had 10 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 one billion over 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.200
 more accurate thermometer on the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 economic stability over security 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.830
 legal and productive capacity 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.380
 of the equator after six years of management 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.930
 correct rotation 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.420
 I want to ask Mr. Peñaherrera have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.520
 given several interviews of the president 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.140
 belt this morning already once they have 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.880
 known the results in one of them 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.190
 has claimed particularly in the plane 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.500
 economic that will not sign treaties of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.420
 free commerce neither with europe nor with usa 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 because it would be a betrayal of 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.490
 citizens who voted for him do you believe 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.950
 that 'Ecuador with an oil economy 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.810
 that if you sell oil to Europe and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.569
 the united states can take this type 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.629
 of decisions 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.120
 Well this is six years in which the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.709
 Ecuador has been isolated from the world does 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.740
 six years we had the possibility of 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.140
 integrate ourselves 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.930
 the North American market and the market 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 European who are the biggest partners 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.400
 of the country in these six years 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.140
 we have seen that these possibilities are 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.550
 have been moving away and today without a doubt 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.020
 by properties statements of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 president of the republic we see that they are 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.320
 impossible then we will have a country 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.880
 small painfully independent of the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.230
 oil production as has been said 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.210
 an economy that depends on the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.970
 oil production that is counted 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.630
 isolated from the world 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.070
 this makes our economy be 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.620
 extremely vulnerable to oscillations 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.890
 of the international oil price that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.980
 it's worth mentioning today I no longer 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.840
 reaches the president belt for the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.120
 huge expense that I pushed in the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.760
 last years and no longer achieves it is not 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.040
 enough that oil with a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.190
 average of 100 dollars then we have 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.390
 had to resort to an important to 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.510
 an important indebtedness with 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.640
 Chinese lenders 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.459
 the insulation will bring as 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.739
 consequence without a doubt what 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.659
 mentioned a greater dependence the 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.209
 oil and on the other hand a lower 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.040
 possibility of investment is to say each 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.829
 time a greater dependence on oil and 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.989
 fiscal spending public spending that is 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.049
 the only one that finally makes the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.049
 economy
