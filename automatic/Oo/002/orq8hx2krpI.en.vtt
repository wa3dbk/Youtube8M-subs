 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection High Grade Universal Century Hizak 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.320
 The high-grade Universal Century affordable by using the latest technology of Bandai 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 It is plastic model series developing in 1/144 scale, and we have been doing more than 15 years already 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.350
 Because long-term popular series 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 Although it is clear that there is a standard of Gunpla, it has become bitter to the story 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.400
 It's supposed to be a new revive 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.480
 If you go to a model shop 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.770
 It's also like the air was like a gun cannon kit . 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 It 's like Uri that it was possible to stretch the limbs and take a nice pose . 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.870
 Hey 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.240
 I did not learn to look like Ideon if I stretched the limbs of a stupid gan canon too much 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.240
 Is it 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.440
 This is a guest in the Transfers of the sixth civilized people 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.440
 I 'm sure I made a kit that was about to fall by the 2nd Army. 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.520
 Rookie cartoonist has just started series of time 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.530
 It seems to be an act of rewriting a cut that can not stand to see 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:04.610
 High Zac is a mass production type mobile suit developed by the Commonwealth Army after the one-year war 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.440
 The result of using federal military technology based on Zion's Zak 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 No matter how versatile it is, you can not use two or more beam weapons simultaneously 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.800
 It is an aircraft that was born with a defect 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 Masu early story of defect areas Degoze 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.660
 Gone are bang-bang mass production by the adults of the situation in spite of the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.430
 Grips was used as a flagship aircraft of the Earth Federation Forces and Titans 2 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.770
 The Earth Federation Forces are painted in light blue and Carnes bright green fuselage colors and the Data Gundam 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.659
 It has been a big success as a target of 100s 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.950
 It is because the production staff wanted to reverse the reason why it is Zaku though it is federal army 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.700
 Not it has been decided 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.789
 Data Gundam is a work depicting the battle between factions in the federal army 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.799
 There was a tearful effort to put out the zion of dione 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.760
 So the incongruous setting is large, can also Fujita, who designed it really is not gonna way 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.220
 I am not satisfied with 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.250
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.610
 Hi-Zac was released in July 2000 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 It is a kit of the 12th high-grade universal century series 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 I'm sure I price there is a whopping 1000 yen Pokkiri Kappa Ebisen of 10 pieces of volume 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.439
 There is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.209
 The proportions are very different from the heavy image of the setting 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:17.130
 Since the recent trend of narrowly arranged arrangement is not a kit that has introduced new innovations 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.330
 I'm sure there's no selling point to say this, it's just like the anime 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.160
 Is a feature 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 As it is said that the treatment setting like this is very sweet , there is a lot of sweetness in the modeler. 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 For me 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.430
 The hearing pipe is made of soft resin and it feels like that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.220
 It was a feeling that interpretation of one part of power pipe was not this 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.510
 In the original design, one power pipe is connected from the forearm to the body through the bottom of the wa 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.599
 It is the specification of Heizakku that is right , but I connect the shoulder and the upper arm with the power pipe 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.000
 It is because one super roll axis has been committed 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.160
 What a bummer 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.240
 0 power pipe is surely But things did not odd the old kit also discomfort was the rubber tube 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.720
 Package or 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.400
 In the concept design of Mr. Katoki Hajime just because the pipe is connected properly 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.770
 I felt like I was in package fraud but I could not 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.040
 We recommend Haizakku of master grade is your reference of recovery 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.270
 But surely while high-grade universal century early 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.920
 It is a pleasure to the Pachi team that the parts are almost color-coded 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.050
 The seal of peace is also good for Gakincho. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.830
 It's a point I can have 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:25.080
 Weapons are with Sunge cool Zaku machine gun kite shield 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.890
 Is this only with the left and right of the fist clumsy of possession ze not about but it came Te 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.050
 A villager who does not have a hand 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:36.590
 It was released at the time of Zeta Gundam broadcasting in 1985 but not been particularly described 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.490
 I can use the weapon set of the old kit. 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.930
 Naturally there is no connection base, but there are some tips on installation 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.310
 The mon old weapon set was a little impressed thing from being can also be diverted to a recent kit 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.750
 you know 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:56.080
 The problem is that the old weapon set is not sold anywhere, right? 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:59.850
 Those who hit the net are not out of the problem because the resale player puts a high price 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.850
 Rifles can be used by Marasai, though
