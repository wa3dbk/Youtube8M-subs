00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.630
 today in the channel how it is done let's see 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.820
 how to germinate a lemon tree 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.830
 first of all let's prepare the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.840
 land where we are going to do the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.630
 germination as you see I have 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.720
 got some forest land and 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.520
 then we add a little bit of pearlite 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.849
 also yesterday we have some fiber of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.220
 coconut 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.890
 we are removing and of course we have 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.200
 that also put earthworm humus already 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.260
 that citrus fruits are demanding 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.149
 to nutrients then it's important that 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.149
 our land is well nourished 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.210
 we remove it well and this we set aside a 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.980
 moment since we are going to prepare a 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.050
 bottle in my case well I'm using 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.640
 a bottle of water forced by the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.140
 half and now let's do some 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.719
 small holes in the bottom 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.510
 so that nobody has to do it 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.059
 with a simple wire we heat it a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.180
 little bit and then how much do you have 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.100
 heat we make the holes we fill the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.890
 container that we are going to use with 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.449
 earth after it is full so what 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 we settle a little with our fingers so that 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.630
 stay the firm ground 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.330
 this we set aside a moment and we're going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.370
 use an old lemon if we do not have a 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.010
 Lemon old at this time what 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.050
 you can do is a lemon that we have what 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.450
 We cut in half and leave it 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.060
 a few days so that it goes dry already 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 then we will take out the seeds is 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.930
 important that we always choose the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.670
 Larger and healthier seeds to 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.610
 then these seeds that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.050
 let's choose we have chosen with a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.230
 These lace knives 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.080
 we will open by the end part 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.870
 to try to remove or open what 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.640
 it would be the husk so it will make me more 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.100
 fast we make a small cut of the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 husk and then we settle it in the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
 recipient because we put a few 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.090
 because we can always fail some 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.870
 seed then then we will take the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.910
 better seed the one that comes better and the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.490
 others simply by the we will start them 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.020
 we cover with a little dirt and now 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.119
 let's proceed to water 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.849
 it is important that you enter the termination 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.849
 that the earth is always wet 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.080
 10 days have passed and here we have a 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.050
 Germination lemon lemon 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.530
 then if after germinating some then 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.220
 simply by the network we would tear it 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.660
 They have spent a few days more 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.450
 containers have given way to the leaves 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.240
 true and this we would pass on to 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.459
 sun where you have plenty of sun during 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.870
 all day since the typical one is also 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.870
 demanding as for sun 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.430
 We will not leave it in a place where 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.430
 be abundant sun 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.510
 it is important that you never miss the water 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.070
 have spent two months here as we see 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.900
 grown pretty already has some leaves 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.129
 pretty firm big 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.510
 and a good color then now let's 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.750
 cut the container since we 're going to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.760
 transplant this lemon tree I have picked a 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.560
 pretty large flowerpot filled it with 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.390
 forest land and now I'm putting 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.620
 earthworm humus because as you 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.560
 he commented is a plant a tree that is 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.209
 demanding in terms of nutrients 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.970
 we have cut the container and now 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.359
 we will proceed to sit it in a hole 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.400
 what we have done on earth and now 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.400
 let's complete the filling 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.490
 as we see in this container after the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 year is coming the year that exactly the 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.359
 next year we will have 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.969
 leaves sorry flowers and will give us 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.750
 lemon trees even if we have a container 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:58.359
 small the tree will grow about 15 or 20 or 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.939
 30 centimeters and we will be giving 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.519
 lemons every year then 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.340
 let's water it so it sits well 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.780
 in the plant and we will take it to a 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.370
 site where there is a sun and shade and here 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.239
 we have about four and ten and then 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 we will pass it to the sun
