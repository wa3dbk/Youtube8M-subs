spinner baits in these type conditions

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
spinner baits in these type conditions
look<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.660> those<00:01:03.750> cloudy<00:01:04.080> days<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.890> the

days that the wind blows those are the
days<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> stirs<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> bait<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.610> what

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
days it stirs up the bait because what

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
days it stirs up the bait because what
is<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> spinner<00:01:09.900> bait<00:01:09.960> imitating<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
is what does a spinner bait imitating a

is what does a spinner bait imitating a
spinner<00:01:11.430> bait<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.909> imitating<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> shad<00:01:12.689> of

some<00:01:13.110> type<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> bait<00:01:13.590> fish<00:01:13.619> these<00:01:14.400> blades<00:01:14.729> are

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
some type of bait fish these blades are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.310 
some type of bait fish these blades are
flashing<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> turning<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.049> water

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
flashing and turning through the water

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
flashing and turning through the water
and<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.040> imitating<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.299> baitfish<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and it's imitating the baitfish in the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
and it's imitating the baitfish in the
area<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.670> bit

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
area and so when you have a little bit

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
area and so when you have a little bit
of<00:01:20.790> wind<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> water<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> chopped<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
of wind and that water is chopped up it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.749 
of wind and that water is chopped up it
makes<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.009> fish<00:01:23.250> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
makes those fish kind of get in a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
makes those fish kind of get in a
feeding<00:01:24.060> mode<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.509> fish<00:01:25.080> them<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.350> those<00:01:25.470> windy

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
feeding mode so fish them on those windy

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
feeding mode so fish them on those windy
and<00:01:25.979> cloudy<00:01:26.130> days<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> you'll<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> lot<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and cloudy days and you'll have a lot of
