00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.650
 next, I still have him 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.260
 like Sigrid 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.649
 2 chords remain this key 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.149
 Accor CP 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.149
 HB Frankfurt 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.519
 if they can only play 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.449
 accompany 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.619
 Summer first for the left hand a nice variant 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.319
 To play chords 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.289
 I do not like mine with their comments that is too high for them 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 I will go to my death 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 Hermes in Monheim 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 not optimal 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.580
 after in the lessons to the inversions then from the accord they find the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 March location 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.790
 Issue 19 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.370
 For the Curbs situation, death is just going and right way 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
 after all good and vifen com 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.000
 before playing this variant c well to the next accord and to the deacon 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 play little in the sense of the basic position 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 No, she reversing him at all 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.450
 that the chords can connect better 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 here so nice 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.500
 I need it now 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 well the right hand sounds 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.950
 I'll take that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.700
 and death approached 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.510
 si 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 and now it's time to get started, you have to go there a bit 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.380
 play m or three 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.970
 never over 3 tactical plays to the band exactly over four bars or 8 days or 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.310
 16 bars 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.600
 otherwise that's funny 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 in bed with our two chords now once four bars 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 first day counts 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 to specify 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.549
 amiando or take 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.359
 and once again 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 and they were from the beginning 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.039
 and pure 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.259
 I am me now 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.389
 I do not want only the sounds he Burkhard c but what sounds good 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.229
 I also watch which notes I always which chord each 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.929
 preferred games 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.939
 the Mannheimer must see 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.170
 you may already be sure that sounds deadly good 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.459
 and loud 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.539
 on 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:20.259
 over 10 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.989
 For example, with the account you can enter b 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 I'll do that now 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.539
 because he gives to counterattack 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.199
 and Ryan Maher reason gates 7 percent 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.449
 Next, I started with the keynote 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.649
 it is also a bit boring because they already play the left 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.929
 but now I start with that he did it 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.699
 most songs 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.730
 The melodies of most will start again 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.329
 that's a wonderful threat in the chord he just sounds great terzic percent 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.919
 Jacks by Georg Ott 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.729
 goes sporty 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 Oliver do they sing 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.370
