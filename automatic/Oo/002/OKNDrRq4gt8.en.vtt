00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.080
 so for all that is transmission 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.900
 secondary location of the kitchen we 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.430
 need a key to dismount the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 wheel of a dynamo key for the ascent 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 a forceps to remove cassava 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.400
 Quick a key 10 and 13 for flat 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.449
 do the chain tension a key of 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.690
 torx 45 a flat wrench of 13 for 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.239
 remove the crown by one meter for 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.339
 check the correct chain tension and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.610
 enough to remove the pinion so be a 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.430
 key either a pneumatic key or on 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.839
 both times a circle ips clip 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.549
 to check the condition of the transmission 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.500
 secondary 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.570
 we're already going to check that the teeth are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.080
 at the level of the crown or sprocket 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 either not pointed or even broken 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 would mean that it was necessary to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.850
 replace everything so do not change either 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.710
 opinion either the chain or the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.520
 crown one changes to be at the same time 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.070
 we take no risk if the chain 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.640
 come back too much when we ride it in the air 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.260
 like that if they show that too much 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.800
 means that what needs to be replaced 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.300
 kitchen to replace the kitchen the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.110
 first thing to do on the four 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.890
 time we pass a speed is there we go 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 high schools the city ​​that holds the pinion 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 if you have a choco key 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 we are free- roaming we unscrew 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 the key shock otherwise a speed up is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.260
 not tight exceptionally loud 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.620
 arrives at high schools the chain we have a 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.600
 quick coupler that lie here we get 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.110
 put the crown of course we take a 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 pliers power strip is the best and there we 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.979
 come here 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.530
 go out like this hop we push back on 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.920
 remove the plate from the link we remove the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.239
 cassava fast and there we can take out the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.150
 chain 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.060
 so if we replace the kitchen what he 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.310
 must know a good tension of chain 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.370
 so there on this bike there is going to be a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.319
 value is here that should be between 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.060
 55 and 58 mm on other brands well 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.180
 sure not to hesitate to take the manual 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 of use check the indications 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.120
 builder 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.000
 if we replaced the chain of course 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.319
 kitchen by a chain kit 9 ​​the chain goes 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.730
 tend to relax on the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.049
 first rollings so well thought about 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.170
 retighten his chain on the first 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.170
 rollings
