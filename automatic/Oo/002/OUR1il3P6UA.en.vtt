score a lot of corners from the direct
header<00:01:38.920> but<00:01:39.460> as<00:01:39.579> you'll<00:01:39.729> see<00:01:39.909> here<00:01:40.149> I<00:01:40.360> actually

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
header but as you'll see here I actually

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.209 
header but as you'll see here I actually
managed<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.229> get<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.439> goal<00:01:41.619> with<00:01:41.799> rounds<00:01:42.100> off

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
managed to get a goal with rounds off

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.100 
managed to get a goal with rounds off
now<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.430> doesn't<00:01:43.000> happen<00:01:43.149> often<00:01:43.450> as<00:01:43.719> I<00:01:43.750> said

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
now that doesn't happen often as I said

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.020 
now that doesn't happen often as I said
but<00:01:44.770> as<00:01:44.979> soon<00:01:45.159> as<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.430> started<00:01:45.670> playing<00:01:45.880> this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
but as soon as I started playing this

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.770 
but as soon as I started playing this
guy<00:01:46.210> he<00:01:46.799> scored<00:01:47.799> two<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.070> two<00:01:48.250> games<00:01:48.780> straight

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
guy he scored two in two games straight

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.600 
guy he scored two in two games straight
away<00:01:50.020> he<00:01:50.200> just<00:01:50.259> leaps<00:01:50.829> above<00:01:51.159> everyone<00:01:51.399> else

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
away he just leaps above everyone else

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.550 
away he just leaps above everyone else
and<00:01:51.850> just<00:01:51.939> gets<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.360> ball<00:01:52.600> he's<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.049> really

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
and just gets the ball he's a really

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.350 
and just gets the ball he's a really
good<00:01:53.799> header<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.520> ball<00:01:54.610> attacking<00:01:55.210> wise

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
good header of the ball attacking wise

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.690 
good header of the ball attacking wise
however<00:01:55.869> defensively<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.649> wouldn't<00:01:57.219> say<00:01:57.430> he's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
however defensively I wouldn't say he's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.060 
however defensively I wouldn't say he's
the<00:01:57.729> best<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.630> my<00:01:59.200> rating<00:01:59.530> out<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.649> 10<00:01:59.740> for<00:01:59.890> this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the best so my rating out of 10 for this

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.630 
the best so my rating out of 10 for this
guy<00:02:00.219> would<00:02:00.460> probably<00:02:00.850> be<00:02:01.060> around<00:02:01.710> six<00:02:02.710> he's
