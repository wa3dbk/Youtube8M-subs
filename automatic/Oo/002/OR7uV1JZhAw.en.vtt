00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 intercontinental pencil case so far 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.030
 pike south american national teams they 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.620
 won seven such matches to europeans in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 it's time to catch up and all expectations 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 Pre-match before this final got on 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 his way ate weight did not lose control 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 over the ball and can connect affiliate 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.560
 this park attack turns on this penny 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.570
 dogs do such football players 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.500
 Argentine national team but still composition 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.880
 running for this ball 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 on command captain rushed fat here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.540
 here is a very unpleasant moment for the Germans 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 here is also a mess happened because 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.300
 famously threw the ball back this nick runner 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 lepsa 4 green 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 among want to the sea 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.600
 great oh what gear there 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.470
 cut out 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 it was dangerous see what 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.250
 rare yes yes nothing bad to cut the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 more she jumped me together we now 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.480
 this comparison will continue just like that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.480
 the germans was second pace well rob 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.840
 because sarella as 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.640
 coach of the national team of durst eighth year and this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.640
 here look and prokidykat 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.650
 just laid down under it 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.290
 cross country chance 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.290
 this 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.270
 position hour stayed schweinsteiger 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 they came out instead 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.649
 about the world of shur I am so 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.649
 failed to complete this combination 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.170
 by hubble by thomas mÃ¼ller 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 there is a blow 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.090
 but because muller 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.480
 he is like that 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 intertwined argentinian works moment 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.490
 afraid of own miss the moment was 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 magnificent and in this case of course 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.510
 no position in it playing with 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.049
 neighbor 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.049
 and be long 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.239
 chair on and of course would like to see 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.239
 so stronger blow 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 dangerously 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.520
 in one touch pushed the ball off 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.440
 see what combination with participation 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.060
 five minutes is less than 10 minutes left 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 from one time 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.650
 quite dangerous and can be attack 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.130
 German national team words under the second pace 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.420
 and the blow fails thrust him 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.160
 assisted to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 without going into the fine I'm here this game that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.209
 qualified as equal to good equals 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.970
 today's match rivals but it's like 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:10.590
 but it is weaker than faust will transmit and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.629
 throws 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.390
 ahead shur mishulin prepare and got up 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.200
 space 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.200
 moment 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.580
 better jason 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 center field is my cool lane what 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.290
 going on 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.630
 these ball flew over the tall 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.640
 someone was 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.250
 mats hummels up to show minutes so 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.750
 praised throughout the game 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 filing this 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.330
 maybe it's golden 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.110
 golden boy of german football 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.580
 men for scoring 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.230
 he is a great Russian championship 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.440
 Mario Goetze 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.440
 This is blue than Goethe Faust 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.370
 and there is very little time left 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.489
 Well, although there is still time studying the ball 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.069
 trail and did not have time 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.840
 and the edge is stopped punch and you feel 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.010
 negotiable was not so dangerous 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.010
 could be active 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.989
 but
