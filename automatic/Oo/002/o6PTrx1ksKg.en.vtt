00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
ok guys the first step in this project

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.210 
ok guys the first step in this project
is<00:02:20.610> pretty<00:02:20.910> self-explanatory<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.890> am

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
is pretty self-explanatory all I am

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.710 
is pretty self-explanatory all I am
basically<00:02:23.459> doing<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.940> looking<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> picture

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
basically doing is looking at a picture

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.020 
basically doing is looking at a picture
I<00:02:24.900> found<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> estimating<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> size<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
I found and estimating the size and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.090 
I found and estimating the size and
measurements<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.810> each<00:02:28.080> piece<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.680> cut<00:02:29.069> out

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
measurements of each piece I cut out

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.430 
measurements of each piece I cut out
each<00:02:29.430> piece<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.090> foam<00:02:30.360> core<00:02:30.630> poster<00:02:31.080> board<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
each piece in foam core poster board and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
each piece in foam core poster board and
then<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> glued<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.549> together<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.360> puzzle

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
then I glued them together like a puzzle

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080 
then I glued them together like a puzzle
this<00:02:34.140> step<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.709> pretty<00:02:35.040> hard<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.940> need

next<00:02:38.850> step<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.480> take<00:02:39.630> air<00:02:39.870> dry<00:02:40.230> clay<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
next step is to take air dry clay and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.070 
next step is to take air dry clay and
mold<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.640> into<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.060> edges<00:02:42.420> filling<00:02:42.959> the

mold it into the edges filling the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.630 
mold it into the edges filling the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
cracks where the foam core is joined

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.490 
cracks where the foam core is joined
together<00:02:44.760> smooth<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:45.870> much<00:02:46.110> as<00:02:46.290> possible

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
together smooth it as much as possible

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500 
together smooth it as much as possible
but<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.250> doesn't<00:02:47.549> have<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.880> perfect<00:02:48.299> after

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
but it doesn't have to be perfect after

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.259

the<00:02:49.080> clay<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.380> dry<00:02:49.739> take<00:02:50.310> sandpaper<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.209> sand

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
the clay is dry take sandpaper and sand

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.020 
the clay is dry take sandpaper and sand
down<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.959> clay<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:53.069> looks<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.610> part

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
down the clay so that it looks like part

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.270 
down the clay so that it looks like part
of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.299> poster<00:02:54.720> board<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.890> take<00:02:56.069> some

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
of the poster board this can take some
