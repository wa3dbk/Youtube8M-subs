00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.050 
texture to my sunflower and I'm just
using<00:00:15.510> that<00:00:15.660> some<00:00:16.560> real<00:00:16.830> dark<00:00:17.070> color<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> as

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you can see I'm quite happy with some of

you can see I'm quite happy with some of
the<00:00:19.590> blends<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.400> some<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.790> those<00:00:20.880> wet

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the blends that I got some of those wet

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.089 
the blends that I got some of those wet
and<00:00:21.300> wet<00:00:21.420> mixes<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.170> really<00:00:22.590> quite<00:00:22.860> pretty

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
and wet mixes are really quite pretty

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.380 
and wet mixes are really quite pretty
and<00:00:23.369> active<00:00:24.829> and<00:00:25.829> I'm<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:26.669> doing<00:00:27.029> short

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and active and I'm just doing short

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
and active and I'm just doing short
little<00:00:27.540> brush<00:00:27.900> strokes<00:00:28.520> thinking<00:00:29.520> seedy

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
little brush strokes thinking seedy

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.200 
little brush strokes thinking seedy
thoughts<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.640> painting<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.759> those<00:00:32.910> dark

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
thoughts and painting in those dark

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.639 
thoughts and painting in those dark
areas<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> key<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.350> really

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
areas and the key to this is to really

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.950 
areas and the key to this is to really
use<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> variety<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:39.470> strokes<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.960> not

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
use a variety of strokes and and not

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.509 
use a variety of strokes and and not
just<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.500> straight<00:00:43.769> across<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.399> very

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
just to go straight across and be very

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.630 
just to go straight across and be very
precise<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.359> just<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.019> freedom<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
precise but just to have that freedom to

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
precise but just to have that freedom to
to<00:00:47.640> fiddle<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.559> dark

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to fiddle around and to put some dark

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
to fiddle around and to put some dark
areas<00:00:49.949> in<00:00:50.539> kind<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> randomly<00:00:52.940> interesting

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
areas in kind of randomly interesting

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.369 
areas in kind of randomly interesting
shapes<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.660> broken<00:00:55.559> lines<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.870> don't<00:00:57.870> usually

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
shapes and broken lines I don't usually

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.560 
shapes and broken lines I don't usually
go<00:00:58.829> straight<00:00:59.579> across<00:01:00.589> without<00:01:02.329> adding<00:01:03.329> some

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
go straight across without adding some

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.130 
go straight across without adding some
variety<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:05.040> empty<00:01:05.339> spaces

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
variety and some little empty spaces

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
variety and some little empty spaces
just<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> an

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
so I'm just going to go in and add some

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.160 
so I'm just going to go in and add some
very<00:02:23.280> final<00:02:23.880> finishing<00:02:24.360> touches<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.810> really

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
very final finishing touches to really

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.449 
very final finishing touches to really
make<00:02:25.319> my<00:02:25.470> petals<00:02:25.860> pop<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.930> working<00:02:28.680> with

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
make my petals pop I'm working with

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.880 
make my petals pop I'm working with
where<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.910> meet<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.390> center<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.349> flower

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
where they meet the center of the flower

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.280 
where they meet the center of the flower
as<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:32.640> as<00:02:32.880> just<00:02:33.660> some<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.900> those<00:02:33.959> shadow

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
as well as just some of those shadow

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.920 
as well as just some of those shadow
areas<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.040> overlap<00:02:35.489> or<00:02:36.209> underlap<00:02:36.690> other

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
areas that overlap or underlap other

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.850 
areas that overlap or underlap other
areas<00:02:38.360> using<00:02:39.360> lots<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.870> violet<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
areas using lots of that violet and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.520 
areas using lots of that violet and
cadmium<00:02:41.310> red<00:02:41.690> combination<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.170> showed

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
cadmium red combination that I showed

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.479 
cadmium red combination that I showed
you<00:02:43.560> before<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:47.550> fine<00:02:47.880> lines<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:49.489> I

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
you before and just fine lines that I

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.370 
you before and just fine lines that I
can<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:50.910> soften<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.540> or<00:02:51.750> leave<00:02:51.900> crisp

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
can then soften out or leave crisp

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.809 
can then soften out or leave crisp
depending<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.069> what<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
depending on what I think that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.860 
depending on what I think that
particular<00:02:54.630> petal<00:02:54.989> needs

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
particular petal needs

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.809 
particular petal needs
it's<00:02:57.870> those<00:02:58.110> contrasts<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.130> colors<00:02:59.519> and

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
it's those contrasts of colors and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.210 
it's those contrasts of colors and
values<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.690> make<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.650> sense<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
values that really make that sense of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.339 
values that really make that sense of
depth<00:03:02.489> happen<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.330> watercolor<00:03:03.840> painting

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.660 

it<00:03:13.349> was<00:03:13.590> good<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.890> back<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> look<00:03:14.490> at<00:03:14.610> it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it was good to back up and look at it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.580 
it was good to back up and look at it
from<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.970> distance<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:15.660> second<00:03:16.080> especially

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
from a distance for a second especially

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.080 
from a distance for a second especially
when<00:03:16.680> you've<00:03:16.800> been<00:03:16.920> working<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.340> detail<00:03:17.730> areas

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
when you've been working on detail areas

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.900 
when you've been working on detail areas
real<00:03:18.300> close<00:03:18.540> I've<00:03:19.200> gone<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> added<00:03:20.730> some

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
real close I've gone in and added some

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.110 
real close I've gone in and added some
shadows<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.510> my<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:22.080> my<00:03:22.200> back<00:03:22.380> leaf<00:03:22.709> there

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
shadows to my to my back leaf there

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.250 
shadows to my to my back leaf there
because<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.420> shadow<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:24.989> going<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> be

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
because it's in shadow it's going to be

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.479 
because it's in shadow it's going to be
a<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.470> bit<00:03:25.620> darker<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> little<00:03:26.400> bit

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
a little bit darker and a little bit

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.449 
a little bit darker and a little bit
cooler

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
cooler

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.590 
cooler
and<00:03:29.459> I'm<00:03:29.610> also<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.060> add<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.569> little

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and I'm also going to add just a little

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.440 
and I'm also going to add just a little
bit<00:03:30.840> more<00:03:31.640> detail<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.790> dimension<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.420> my

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
bit more detail and dimension to my

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.590 
bit more detail and dimension to my
veins<00:03:34.310> just<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.430> make<00:03:35.580> them<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.060> little<00:03:36.360> bit

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
veins just to make them a little bit

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.330 
veins just to make them a little bit
more<00:03:36.630> dimensional<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.100> pop<00:03:38.310> a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
more dimensional and just to pop a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.780 
more dimensional and just to pop a
little<00:03:38.489> bit<00:03:38.819> more

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.309 

just<00:03:43.790> got<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:43.969> bit<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.359> dark<00:03:44.599> green<00:03:44.930> again

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
just got a bit of a dark green again

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.800 
just got a bit of a dark green again
kind<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.099> shadow<00:03:46.370> color<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:47.120> little<00:03:47.480> bit<00:03:47.599> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
kind of a shadow color a little bit of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.199 
kind of a shadow color a little bit of
blue<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.379> it's<00:03:48.500> nice<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.709> cool<00:03:49.209> I'm

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
blue in it so it's nice and cool I'm

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.759 
blue in it so it's nice and cool I'm
just<00:03:50.359> going<00:03:50.629> on<00:03:50.719> the<00:03:50.840> shadow<00:03:51.140> side<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
just going on the shadow side of the

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.280 
just going on the shadow side of the
leaf<00:03:53.920> where<00:03:54.920> I'd<00:03:55.069> imagine<00:03:55.519> a<00:03:55.579> shadow<00:03:55.879> would<00:03:56.090> be

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
leaf where I'd imagine a shadow would be

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.990 
leaf where I'd imagine a shadow would be
coming<00:03:57.290> from<00:03:57.409> the<00:03:57.590> direction<00:03:57.739> which<00:03:58.670> directly

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
coming from the direction which directly

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.369 
coming from the direction which directly
whichever<00:03:59.299> direction<00:03:59.719> the<00:03:59.810> Sun<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.109> coming

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
whichever direction the Sun is coming

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.069 
whichever direction the Sun is coming
from<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.150> I'm<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.450> softening<00:04:02.930> that

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
from and then I'm just softening that

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:11.050 
from and then I'm just softening that
out<00:04:05.409> with<00:04:06.409> clear<00:04:06.739> water<00:04:09.609> under<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.639> petal

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
out with clear water under the petal

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.420 
out with clear water under the petal
there's<00:04:11.209> going<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.389> be<00:04:11.480> some<00:04:11.719> shadow<00:04:11.989> too<00:04:12.430> then

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
there's going to be some shadow too then

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.580 
there's going to be some shadow too then
again<00:04:13.730> blending<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.359> out<00:04:14.480> lifting<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:15.349> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
again blending it out lifting and and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.920 
again blending it out lifting and and
blending<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.669> out<00:04:16.729> with<00:04:16.910> some<00:04:17.090> clear<00:04:17.389> water<00:04:17.570> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
blending it out with some clear water a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.129 
blending it out with some clear water a
slightly<00:04:18.799> damp<00:04:19.039> brush<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:22.750> lot<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.900> these<00:04:23.990> are

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
slightly damp brush a lot of these are

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.279 
slightly damp brush a lot of these are
very<00:04:24.320> subtle<00:04:24.620> effects<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:25.520> they<00:04:25.759> really<00:04:26.389> make

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
very subtle effects but they really make

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.920 
very subtle effects but they really make
a<00:04:27.340> much<00:04:28.340> more<00:04:28.610> finished<00:04:28.849> look<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.449> painting

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
a much more finished look to a painting

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.930 
a much more finished look to a painting
if<00:04:30.560> you're<00:04:30.710> willing<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.009> take<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.310> time<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:31.820> do

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
if you're willing to take the time to do

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:41.350 
if you're willing to take the time to do
them

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
now I'm going to add some shadows under

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.940 
now I'm going to add some shadows under
my<00:05:04.150> petals<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:04.870> work<00:05:05.140> with<00:05:05.320> my<00:05:05.440> background<00:05:05.890> a

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
my petals and work with my background a

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.140 
my petals and work with my background a
little<00:05:06.070> bit<00:05:06.190> more<00:05:06.490> it's<00:05:06.700> looking<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.060> little

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
little bit more it's looking a little

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.240 
little bit more it's looking a little
bit<00:05:07.360> flat<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:07.990> I'm<00:05:08.590> just<00:05:08.740> going<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.890> add<00:05:09.040> in

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
bit flat so I'm just going to add in

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.060 
bit flat so I'm just going to add in
another<00:05:09.940> layer<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.510> some<00:05:10.840> wet<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.650> variegated

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
another layer of some wet and variegated

another layer of some wet and variegated
color<00:05:15.120> statting<00:05:16.120> water<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.690> some<00:05:17.200> shadow

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
color statting water and some shadow

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.700 
color statting water and some shadow
colors<00:05:17.890> where<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.490> think<00:05:18.850> they<00:05:18.970> need<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.150> be<00:05:19.300> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
colors where I think they need to be and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.550 
colors where I think they need to be and
especially<00:05:20.710> under<00:05:21.130> my<00:05:21.250> petals<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:23.230> sun<00:05:23.440> is

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
especially under my petals the sun is

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.650 
especially under my petals the sun is
shining<00:05:23.890> on<00:05:23.980> my<00:05:24.220> sunflower<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:25.000> petals<00:05:25.510> are

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
shining on my sunflower the petals are

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.240 
shining on my sunflower the petals are
going<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.840> cast<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.260> shadow<00:05:26.290> on<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.920> whatever's

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
going to cast a shadow on to whatever's

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
in the background and of course this is

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.460 
in the background and of course this is
also<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:31.030> really<00:05:31.270> nice<00:05:31.510> way<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.750> kind<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.080> neaten

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
also a really nice way to kind of neaten

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.140 
also a really nice way to kind of neaten
up<00:05:32.590> those<00:05:32.830> petals<00:05:33.130> if<00:05:33.400> you've<00:05:33.550> got<00:05:33.760> any<00:05:33.910> rough

up those petals if you've got any rough
edges<00:05:34.530> it's<00:05:35.530> not<00:05:35.710> as<00:05:35.830> crisp<00:05:36.130> as<00:05:36.310> you'd<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:36.580> it

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760
