then we see stars and he's on a plate so
and<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.199> chapter<00:04:37.470> right<00:04:37.770> there<00:04:37.979> it's

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and that's chapter right there it's

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.890 
and that's chapter right there it's
again<00:04:38.789> very<00:04:38.819> simple<00:04:39.389> very<00:04:39.509> straightforward

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
again very simple very straightforward

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.040 
again very simple very straightforward
and<00:04:40.289> all<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.250> say<00:04:41.639> about<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.720> that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
and all I can say about this is that

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.420 
and all I can say about this is that
this<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.830> actually<00:04:44.159> very<00:04:44.340> important<00:04:44.940> for<00:04:45.599> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
this is actually very important for the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.740 
this is actually very important for the
because<00:04:47.430> again<00:04:48.000> I've<00:04:48.150> said<00:04:48.300> before<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.629> said

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
because again I've said before and said

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.390 
because again I've said before and said
again<00:04:48.870> there<00:04:49.590> should<00:04:49.919> have<00:04:49.949> been<00:04:50.039> some

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
again there should have been some

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.930 
again there should have been some
awakening<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:50.940> power<00:04:51.169> when<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.940> characters

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
awakening of power when the characters

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.860 
awakening of power when the characters
use<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> Osho<00:04:54.750> coupons<00:04:55.110> on<00:04:55.319> and<00:04:56.300> with<00:04:57.300> Sony's

hesitate something else along solid food

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.209 
hesitate something else along solid food
on<00:05:12.389> earth<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.780> food<00:05:13.289> immersion<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:13.919> that<00:05:14.069> in

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
on earth and food immersion and that in

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:19.040 
on earth and food immersion and that in
fact<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.729> his<00:05:15.270> new<00:05:15.990> ultimate<00:05:16.590> routine<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
fact is his new ultimate routine and the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.830 
fact is his new ultimate routine and the
routines<00:05:19.409> are<00:05:19.590> nice<00:05:19.860> but<00:05:20.669> they<00:05:20.819> do<00:05:20.879> I<00:05:21.300> up<00:05:21.509> from

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
routines are nice but they do I up from

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.689 
routines are nice but they do I up from
my<00:05:21.990> knowledge<00:05:22.289> of<00:05:22.560> them<00:05:22.800> when<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.430> comes<00:05:23.610> to

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
my knowledge of them when it comes to

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:24.980 
my knowledge of them when it comes to
the<00:05:23.789> grimly<00:05:24.090> nights<00:05:24.330> they<00:05:24.509> have<00:05:24.659> to<00:05:24.750> do<00:05:24.840> like

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
the grimly nights they have to do like

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.800 
the grimly nights they have to do like
some<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.650> literally<00:05:26.130> like<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.520> routine<00:05:26.909> but

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
some it's literally like a routine but

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.510 
some it's literally like a routine but
before<00:05:28.229> they<00:05:28.349> can<00:05:28.469> attack<00:05:28.560> so<00:05:28.949> it<00:05:29.009> takes<00:05:29.219> time

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
before they can attack so it takes time

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.430 
before they can attack so it takes time
to<00:05:29.550> serve<00:05:30.029> I<00:05:30.180> believe<00:05:30.449> but<00:05:30.930> then<00:05:31.080> again<00:05:31.199> maybe

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
to serve I believe but then again maybe

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.620 
to serve I believe but then again maybe
not<00:05:31.800> because<00:05:32.490> Toriko<00:05:33.000> was<00:05:33.150> able<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.509> actually

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
not because Toriko was able to actually

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.240 
not because Toriko was able to actually
put<00:05:34.080> stars<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.500> know<00:05:34.590> I'm<00:05:34.740> like<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:34.919> mega

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
put stars you know I'm like a mega

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.219 
put stars you know I'm like a mega
defensive<00:05:35.669> buff<00:05:35.880> position<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:36.599> they<00:05:37.020> seek

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
defensive buff position and they seek

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.610 
defensive buff position and they seek
chapter<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:38.159> I<00:05:39.050> don't<00:05:40.050> know<00:05:40.110> whether<00:05:40.229> I<00:05:40.409> don't

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
chapter so I don't know whether I don't

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.830 
chapter so I don't know whether I don't
know<00:05:40.710> where<00:05:40.830> it's<00:05:40.949> gonna<00:05:41.039> lead<00:05:41.310> but<00:05:41.789> I<00:05:42.029> believe

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
know where it's gonna lead but I believe

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.999 
know where it's gonna lead but I believe
that<00:05:43.020> stars<00:05:43.349> in<00:05:43.529> is<00:05:43.620> gonna<00:05:43.740> be<00:05:43.830> able<00:05:43.889> to

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
that stars in is gonna be able to

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.990 
that stars in is gonna be able to
counter<00:05:44.370> this<00:05:44.490> alternate<00:05:45.210> een<00:05:45.419> and<00:05:45.659> then<00:05:46.349> once

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
counter this alternate een and then once

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.580 
counter this alternate een and then once
stars<00:05:48.000> and<00:05:48.210> counters<00:05:48.539> is<00:05:48.659> Alton<00:05:48.990> routine

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
stars and counters is Alton routine

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.300 
stars and counters is Alton routine
Toriko<00:05:50.430> may<00:05:50.969> go<00:05:51.210> into<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:51.599> Auto<00:05:52.289> foggy<00:05:53.009> state

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
Toriko may go into that Auto foggy state

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.360 
Toriko may go into that Auto foggy state
and<00:05:53.610> then<00:05:54.000> he<00:05:54.090> may<00:05:54.300> awaken<00:05:54.719> some<00:05:55.169> part<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.650> his
