00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.500
 and there 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880
 today it is up to us to study the kingdoms 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.119
 of the nature 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.050
 to not guess without the air I do not live 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:31.109
 without the earth and I'm dying I have buds 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.109
 without being an egg I have a cup and we are man 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.530
 the realms of nature plants 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.170
 mushrooms animals protest currency 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 There are many living beings with whom you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 convives and you carry your weight well your 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.630
 cat the plants your parents your teacher 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.539
 but many others live far away from you 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.700
 and others are very close but they are so 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.299
 little ones that you do not realize they're 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.260
 there you can meet them and know how 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.820
 they are grouped 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.010
 coin kingdom are very small organisms 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.560
 that can only be observed with 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.399
 very powerful microscopes 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.549
 king does not protest in this kingdom there are groups 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.329
 very heterogeneous formed by cells with 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.289
 kingdom core noodle served the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.420
 mushrooms 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.729
 these are organisms among others is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 say that they can not elaborate their own 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.229
 food that's why you should be nourished 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.410
 substances made by other beings 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.989
 living are pro- row organisms 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.660
 who share qualities of the kingdoms 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.450
 vegetable and animal 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 some plants are grouped in call of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.450
 and you're algae and bryophytes mosses 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.060
 liverworts and plants that have flowers and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.000
 seeds are grouped into thermal genes 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.180
 whose seeds you can see pines 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.240
 cypresses and angiosperms whose seeds 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.740
 They are protected inside walnut fruits 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.430
 and daisy animal kingdom we use mollusks 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.670
 annelid snails arthropods crustaceans 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.950
 arandinos and insects echinoderms hedgehogs 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.590
 and starfish with the cut ones 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.840
 animals with the dorsal structure that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.190
 they serve as skeletons and vertebrates 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.520
 amphibian weights reptiles 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.110
 birds mammals amphibian sharks and 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.110
 reptiles belong to this full 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.090
 the kingdoms of nature is the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.090
