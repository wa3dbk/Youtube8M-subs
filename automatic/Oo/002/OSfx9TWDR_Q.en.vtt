00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
I am repotting jasmine plant this one I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.169 
I am repotting jasmine plant this one I
just<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> couple<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.760> weeks<00:00:17.970> ago<00:00:18.380> and

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
just got a couple of weeks ago and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.929 
just got a couple of weeks ago and
working<00:00:21.179> out<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> roots<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.699> about<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
working out the roots are all about it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.380 
working out the roots are all about it
that's<00:00:24.060> called<00:00:24.329> rebound<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.619> means<00:00:29.089> okay<00:00:30.089> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

that's called rebound that means okay so
that's<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.380> root<00:00:31.739> bound<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.400> pull

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that's that's root bound if you pull

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:54.080 
that's that's root bound if you pull
them<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.519> take<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> plant

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
them out you can actually take the plant

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
them out you can actually take the plant

things about putting charcoal wood all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.600 
things about putting charcoal wood all
kinds<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> stuff<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
kinds of stuff in the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.070 
kinds of stuff in the
rabble<00:01:28.450> rabble<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:30.490> like<00:01:31.240> if<00:01:31.420> you're<00:01:31.600> using<00:01:31.810> a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
rabble rabble is like if you're using a

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.650 
rabble rabble is like if you're using a
really<00:01:32.260> heavy<00:01:32.620> soil<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.730> definitely<00:01:34.390> want<00:01:34.600> to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
really heavy soil you definitely want to

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.110 
really heavy soil you definitely want to
put<00:01:34.810> gravel<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.440> bottom<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
put gravel in the bottom so that you

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.450 
put gravel in the bottom so that you
have<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.290> ground<00:01:41.500> doesn't<00:01:41.830> get<00:01:41.950> compacted

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
have so the ground doesn't get compacted

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.150 
have so the ground doesn't get compacted
and<00:01:43.000> causes<00:01:43.540> of<00:01:43.690> root<00:01:43.870> rot<00:01:44.170> because<00:01:44.590> what<00:01:44.950> root

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
and causes of root rot because what root

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.730 
and causes of root rot because what root
rot<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> dirt<00:01:46.960> gets<00:01:47.200> really<00:01:47.590> really

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
rot is it is the dirt gets really really

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.300 
rot is it is the dirt gets really really
too<00:01:48.430> wet<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.210> hard<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.500> doesn't<00:01:50.950> go<00:01:51.130> out

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
too wet and hard and it doesn't go out

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.140 
too wet and hard and it doesn't go out
of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.580> bottom<00:01:51.970> there<00:01:52.980> oh<00:01:53.980> yeah<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:54.580> never<00:01:54.880> want

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
of the bottom there oh yeah I never want

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.740 
of the bottom there oh yeah I never want
to<00:01:55.180> plant<00:01:55.480> anything<00:01:56.140> unless<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.860> not<00:01:56.980> all

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to plant anything unless it's not all

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750 
to plant anything unless it's not all
because<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.320> want<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.520> want<00:02:00.700> the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
because you you want the you want the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.810 
because you you want the you want the
soil<00:02:01.030> moist<00:02:01.510> but<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.260> don't<00:02:02.530> want<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.010> sopping

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
soil moist but you don't want it sopping

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.200 
soil moist but you don't want it sopping
wet<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.479> bottom<00:02:04.510> or<00:02:05.170> it'll<00:02:05.470> kill<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.830> plan

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
wet on the bottom or it'll kill the plan

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.320 
wet on the bottom or it'll kill the plan
right<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.690> like<00:02:07.930> thinking<00:02:08.500> about<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.940> we

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
right it's like thinking about if we

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.410 
right it's like thinking about if we
were<00:02:10.540> standing<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.200> water<00:02:11.700> 24/7<00:02:12.700> our<00:02:12.820> legs<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
were standing in water 24/7 our legs of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.170 
were standing in water 24/7 our legs of
it<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.470> gross<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:16.000> way<00:02:16.120> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
it all gross you know that's a way to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.280 
it all gross you know that's a way to
think<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.020> roots<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.300> when

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
think about it for roots so when I when

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.510 
think about it for roots so when I when
I<00:02:20.410> pop<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:21.070> as<00:02:21.580> far<00:02:21.880> as<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.209> depth<00:02:23.310> once<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
I pop this as far as the depth once the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880 
I pop this as far as the depth once the
I'm<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:25.900> bit<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.380> dirt<00:02:26.740> on

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
I'm like just a little bit of dirt on

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.420 
I'm like just a little bit of dirt on
the<00:02:27.010> top<00:02:27.220> here<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:29.020> couldn't<00:02:29.590> about<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.280> one

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the top here so I couldn't about the one

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.570 
the top here so I couldn't about the one
over<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> couple<00:02:31.120> inches<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:33.100> where<00:02:33.310> when<00:02:33.489> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
over on a couple inches to where when I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.660 
over on a couple inches to where when I
set<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.330> there

and yeah you don't want to go with too
big<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.970> plot<00:02:48.210> either<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.170> when

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
big of a plot either when you go it when

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.980 
big of a plot either when you go it when
you're<00:02:49.560> doing<00:02:50.010> bigger<00:02:50.430> pots<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.270> know<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.750> I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
you're doing bigger pots you know like I

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.660 
you're doing bigger pots you know like I
wouldn't<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.800> plant<00:02:53.220> really

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
wouldn't want to put this plant really

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.830 
wouldn't want to put this plant really
huge<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:56.210> then<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.570> roots

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
huge but right because then that roots

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.500 
huge but right because then that roots
try<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> take<00:02:58.890> off<00:02:59.130> too<00:02:59.370> fast<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.030> actually

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
try to take off too fast but actually

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.090 
try to take off too fast but actually
guys<00:03:00.720> I'm<00:03:01.110> not<00:03:01.410> sure<00:03:01.620> how<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.800> works<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.990> I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
guys I'm not sure how that works so I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.790 
guys I'm not sure how that works so I
just<00:03:05.100> take<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:11.690> hey<00:03:12.690> maybe<00:03:12.990> that's<00:03:13.350> why<00:03:13.530> we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
just take the hey maybe that's why we

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.160 
just take the hey maybe that's why we
didn't<00:03:14.160> put<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.490> big<00:03:15.360> slice<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.230> table

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
didn't put the big slice on this table

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:34.040 
didn't put the big slice on this table
falling<00:03:19.170> down<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> we<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.630> paddle

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
falling down and we just get a paddle

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.540 
falling down and we just get a paddle
bit<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.440> drill<00:03:34.650> some<00:03:34.860> holes<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:37.250> drink<00:03:38.250> you

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.460 

don't<00:03:41.550> have<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.150> wet<00:03:42.390> them<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.959> table<00:03:43.230> so

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
don't have to wet them on this table so

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.440 
don't have to wet them on this table so
maybe<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.250> good<00:03:44.280> idea<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.820> leave<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.300> this

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
maybe it's a good idea to leave it this

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.910 
maybe it's a good idea to leave it this
way<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:46.050> my<00:03:46.200> carrot<00:03:46.500> doesn't<00:03:46.830> go

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
way and then my carrot doesn't go

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.990 
way and then my carrot doesn't go
falling<00:03:47.370> through<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.670> tamping<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
falling through so tamping it in a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.880 
falling through so tamping it in a
little<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.750> sides<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.320> don't<00:03:52.470> want<00:03:52.769> to

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
little on the sides you don't want to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.759 
little on the sides you don't want to
like<00:03:53.070> press<00:03:53.459> really<00:03:53.970> hard<00:03:54.269> because<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.530> want

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
like press really hard because you want

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.429 
like press really hard because you want
the<00:03:55.950> soil<00:03:56.820> nice

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
the soil nice

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.450 
the soil nice
right

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.960 

okay<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.480> when<00:04:05.960> that's<00:04:06.170> done<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.700> pretty

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
okay so when that's done that's pretty

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.720 
okay so when that's done that's pretty
much<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.420> there<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:11.380> that's<00:04:12.380> water<00:04:12.710> now

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
much all there is to it that's water now

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.720 
much all there is to it that's water now
just<00:04:14.150> guess<00:04:15.430> well<00:04:19.480> not<00:04:20.480> only<00:04:20.600> about<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.960> quart

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
just guess well not only about a quart

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.140 
just guess well not only about a quart
we<00:04:22.730> want<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.030> soak<00:04:24.190> soak<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.370> really<00:04:25.910> really

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
we want to soak soak it really really

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.060 
we want to soak soak it really really
really<00:04:26.180> well<00:04:26.660> when<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.990> do<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.170> transplant

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
really well when you do a transplant

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.670 
really well when you do a transplant
so<00:04:28.250> you've<00:04:28.640> soaked<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.390> really<00:04:29.690> good<00:04:29.930> it's

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
so you've soaked it really good it's

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.170 
so you've soaked it really good it's
gonna<00:04:30.920> drain<00:04:31.220> out<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.580> bottom<00:04:31.970> which<00:04:32.120> is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
gonna drain out of the bottom which is

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.420 
gonna drain out of the bottom which is
good<00:04:32.600> but<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> want<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.320> keep<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.740> soil

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
good but you want to keep the soil

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.620 
good but you want to keep the soil
really<00:04:34.940> moist

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
really moist

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.970 
really moist
well<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.020> will<00:04:36.140> give<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.380> an<00:04:36.440> idea<00:04:36.770> when

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
well that will give you an idea when

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.090 
well that will give you an idea when
it's<00:04:37.600> not<00:04:38.600> water's<00:04:39.080> gonna<00:04:39.620> come<00:04:39.830> out<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.010> the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
it's not water's gonna come out of the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.320 
it's not water's gonna come out of the
bottom<00:04:40.430> right<00:04:40.640> right<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:42.140> when<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.590> water

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
bottom right right so when you water

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.760 
bottom right right so when you water
that's<00:04:44.330> what<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:44.690> want<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.230> you<00:04:45.350> want<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.680> to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
that's what you want that you want it to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.380 
that's what you want that you want it to
come<00:04:45.950> out<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> bottom<00:04:46.700> because<00:04:46.880> then<00:04:47.240> you

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
come out of the bottom because then you

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.450 
come out of the bottom because then you
know<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:48.020> then<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.010> know<00:04:49.160> that<00:04:49.310> it's

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
know that it's then you know that it's

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.030 
know that it's then you know that it's
getting<00:04:49.640> wet<00:04:50.060> all<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.630> way<00:04:50.780> down<00:04:51.530> into<00:04:51.800> their

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
getting wet all the way down into their

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.950 
getting wet all the way down into their
roots<00:04:52.340> because<00:04:53.330> if<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.570> don't<00:04:53.750> give<00:04:53.930> it

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
roots because if you don't give it

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.880 
roots because if you don't give it
enough<00:04:54.350> water<00:04:54.680> then<00:04:55.550> their<00:04:55.760> roots<00:04:55.970> are<00:04:56.180> get

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
enough water then their roots are get

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:08.629 
enough water then their roots are get
anything<00:04:57.890> down<00:04:58.250> there

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.740 

I'll<00:05:09.639> never<00:05:09.880> go<00:05:10.090> butter<00:05:13.560> already<00:05:14.560> it's<00:05:15.190> gonna

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
real tiny plant so you can take I might

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.790 
real tiny plant so you can take I might
do<00:06:35.150> this<00:06:35.360> with<00:06:35.599> this<00:06:35.779> plant<00:06:36.169> is<00:06:36.409> to<00:06:36.560> take<00:06:36.770> a

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
do this with this plant is to take a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.749 
do this with this plant is to take a
hanger<00:06:37.340> now<00:06:37.550> or<00:06:38.210> a<00:06:38.270> wire<00:06:38.779> and<00:06:39.250> then<00:06:40.250> loop<00:06:40.520> all

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
hanger now or a wire and then loop all

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.550 
hanger now or a wire and then loop all
of<00:06:40.969> these<00:06:41.120> things<00:06:41.419> around<00:06:41.659> and<00:06:42.080> you<00:06:42.199> can<00:06:42.379> make

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
of these things around and you can make

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.860 
of these things around and you can make
it<00:06:42.710> go<00:06:42.889> into<00:06:43.099> a<00:06:43.279> heart<00:06:43.789> shape<00:06:43.879> or<00:06:44.569> whatever

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
it go into a heart shape or whatever

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.029 
it go into a heart shape or whatever
shape<00:06:45.169> you<00:06:45.229> want<00:06:46.659> but<00:06:47.770> tomorrow<00:06:48.770> I'll

shape you want but tomorrow I'll

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.619 
shape you want but tomorrow I'll
probably<00:06:49.340> take<00:06:49.789> cuttings<00:06:50.479> off<00:06:50.870> of<00:06:51.050> this<00:06:51.199> and

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
probably take cuttings off of this and

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.470 
probably take cuttings off of this and
make<00:06:53.629> new<00:06:53.870> plants<00:06:54.199> so<00:06:54.860> I'll<00:06:55.069> cut<00:06:55.370> those

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
make new plants so I'll cut those
