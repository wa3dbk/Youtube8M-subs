00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A professional mandolin is worth the investment. The food receptacle and pusher protect your fingers from the sharp blades. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It includes a stand that folds down for storage. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Various blades 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
All the cuts are performed quickly without requiring you to handle the dangerous blades, thanks to the built-in guide system. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Depending on the brand, the mandolin has two or more julienne blades – one for a wide cut 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the other for thin julienne. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A third blade is located at the bottom for thin slicing or making a crinkle or waffle cut. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can adjust the blade thickness

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
using the gauge under the mandolin – there are two so you can adjust the upper blade

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and the lower one. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Before starting, place the stand on a damp towel to keep it from sliding. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Put the food receptacle in place. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Choose the blade, julienne blade and thickness according to the desired cut. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Place the vegetable inside the receptacle. It should be cut to fit the receptacle. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Close. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then push toward the bottom and repeat as often as desired. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because we’ve selected the wide julienne blade, we get sticks – a perfect cut for a raw vegetable platter. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:09.000
For thin julienne, choose the thin julienne blade and minimum thickness. The technique is the same. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
For the waffle or crinkle cut, adjust the lower blade. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You can change the thickness as needed, or depending on the vegetable. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:03:03.000
How about waffle fries for dinner?
You then work without the receptacle using the large end of the vegetable as a handle. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You can then slice them thinly to form confetti. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.200
A mandolin, like a good set of knifes, is part of a good cook’s basic tools.
