recently the SGU was challenged with an
anomalous<00:00:15.960> photograph<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.340> did<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> little

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
anomalous photograph and we did a little

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.460 
anomalous photograph and we did a little
bit<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> investigation<00:00:18.690> Bob<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.109> tell<00:00:19.350> us

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
pictures that this guy Brian took that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.380 
pictures that this guy Brian took that
actually<00:00:26.010> while<00:00:26.160> his<00:00:26.340> 8<00:00:26.580> year<00:00:26.730> old<00:00:26.849> son<00:00:27.150> took

actually while his 8 year old son took

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509 
actually while his 8 year old son took
them<00:00:27.630> he<00:00:27.990> said<00:00:28.170> he<00:00:28.260> has<00:00:28.349> no<00:00:28.500> associations<00:00:29.250> with

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
them he said he has no associations with

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.279 
them he said he has no associations with
any<00:00:29.670> paranormal<00:00:30.090> circles<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.900> doesn't<00:00:31.170> want

any paranormal circles and doesn't want
to<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.380> associated<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to be associated with them so it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
to be associated with them so it
instantly<00:00:33.120> liked<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> guy<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.320> he<00:00:34.440> sent<00:00:34.680> us

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
instantly liked this guy so he sent us
the<00:00:34.950> pictures<00:00:35.630> essentially<00:00:36.630> he<00:00:36.719> gave<00:00:36.899> us<00:00:37.020> two

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the pictures essentially he gave us two

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
the pictures essentially he gave us two
pictures<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.950> close-up<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> Brian's<00:00:39.629> face

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pictures one a close-up of Brian's face

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.819 
pictures one a close-up of Brian's face
with<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.920> rope<00:00:41.700> light<00:00:41.969> streaking<00:00:42.809> across<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
with a rope light streaking across the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
with a rope light streaking across the
entire<00:00:44.129> photograph<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.820> green<00:00:45.120> light<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.750> little

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
entire photograph a green light a little

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
entire photograph a green light a little
bit<00:00:46.469> squiggly<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.520> second<00:00:48.000> picture<00:00:48.210> was

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bit squiggly the second picture was

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
bit squiggly the second picture was
another<00:00:48.870> picture<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.410> Brian<00:00:49.770> driving<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
another picture of Brian driving with a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
another picture of Brian driving with a
somewhat<00:00:51.510> lighter<00:00:51.899> colored<00:00:52.350> thinner<00:00:52.860> rope

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
somewhat lighter colored thinner rope

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
somewhat lighter colored thinner rope
light<00:00:53.610> squiggling<00:00:54.210> around<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> driver's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
light squiggling around on the driver's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.490 
light squiggling around on the driver's
side<00:00:55.770> window<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.910> immediately<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.629> realized

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
side window so immediately I realized

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
side window so immediately I realized
this<00:00:58.770> must<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> been<00:00:59.399> some<00:01:00.030> type<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this must have been some type of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.709 
this must have been some type of
exposure<00:01:01.079> long<00:01:01.980> exposure<00:01:02.510> effect<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
exposure long exposure effect that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
exposure long exposure effect that
caused<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:05.070> each<00:01:05.250> came<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> bunch

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
caused this we each came up with a bunch

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
caused this we each came up with a bunch
of<00:01:06.060> different<00:01:06.360> reasons<00:01:06.390> why<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.840> probably<00:01:07.229> was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of different reasons why it probably was

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.830 
of different reasons why it probably was
a<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.830> exposure<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> crucial<00:01:09.270> ones

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a long exposure one of the crucial ones

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
a long exposure one of the crucial ones
I<00:01:09.990> came<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> realized<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> digital

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I came up with I realized that digital

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
I came up with I realized that digital
pictures<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.150> metadata<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.900> tells<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
pictures have metadata that tells you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.679 
pictures have metadata that tells you
the<00:01:13.680> state<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> camera<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.509> looked

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the state the camera was in so we looked

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
the state the camera was in so we looked
at<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> metadata<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> found<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> indeed

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
at the metadata and found that indeed

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
at the metadata and found that indeed
there<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> two-second<00:01:18.600> exposure<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:19.170> both

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there was a two-second exposure on both

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
there was a two-second exposure on both
of<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:19.650> pictures<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> me<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
of these pictures which to me was a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
of these pictures which to me was a
smoking<00:01:21.570> gun<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> key<00:01:22.680> element<00:01:22.710> in

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
smoking gun that was the key element in

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
smoking gun that was the key element in
these<00:01:23.700> pictures<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> long

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
these pictures that it was the long

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
these pictures that it was the long
exposure<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.860> quick<00:01:26.460> shot<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
exposure and not just a quick shot and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.410 
exposure and not just a quick shot and
that<00:01:26.939> was<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that was it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
that was it
and<00:01:27.659> typically<00:01:28.049> Bob<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> these

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and typically Bob a lot of these

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
and typically Bob a lot of these
anomalies<00:01:29.369> come<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> flash<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
anomalies come out from the flash and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.899 
anomalies come out from the flash and
when<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> flash<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.890> present<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> these

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
when a flash is present a lot of these

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.060 
when a flash is present a lot of these
weird<00:01:33.180> lighting<00:01:33.509> effects<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.259> present<00:01:34.829> right

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
weird lighting effects are present right

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
weird lighting effects are present right
a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> flashback<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.990> cause

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
a lot of a lot of flashback is the cause

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710 
a lot of a lot of flashback is the cause
of<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:37.829> anomalies<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
of a lot of these anomalies and but this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.560 
of a lot of these anomalies and but this
one<00:01:39.960> though<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.829> flashback<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.210> had<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
one though is not flashback it had to be

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
one though is not flashback it had to be
a<00:01:42.600> long<00:01:43.079> exposure<00:01:43.560> related<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.820> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
a long exposure related and it was but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
a long exposure related and it was but
as<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> result<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> blog<00:01:46.079> though<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
as a result of the blog though a lot of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
as a result of the blog though a lot of
more<00:01:47.009> details<00:01:47.399> came<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
more details came out and a lot of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
more details came out and a lot of
people<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> great<00:01:49.470> insight<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
people had a lot of great insight that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
people had a lot of great insight that
that<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> didn't<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.350> we

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that I didn't think of and we I think we

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
that I didn't think of and we I think we
pretty<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:52.860> nailed<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.520> whole<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.939> dude

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
pretty much nailed this whole thing dude

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.569 
pretty much nailed this whole thing dude
due<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> comments<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.460> odd

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
due to a lot of the comments the odd

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
due to a lot of the comments the odd
thing<00:01:56.820> about<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.270> long<00:01:57.540> exposure<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
thing about the long exposure is that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
thing about the long exposure is that
nothing<00:01:58.860> else<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> photo<00:01:59.610> looked<00:02:00.060> blurry

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
nothing else in the photo looked blurry

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300 
nothing else in the photo looked blurry
when<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.170> look<00:02:01.409> at<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> photo<00:02:01.920> right

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
when you first look at the photo right

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.679 
when you first look at the photo right
that's<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.119> interesting<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that's right that was interesting and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
that's right that was interesting and
but<00:02:04.079> eventually<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.920> together<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
but eventually we put together that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.880 
but eventually we put together that
right<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> mode<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.350> some<00:02:07.560> digital

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
right this was a mode that some digital

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
right this was a mode that some digital
cameras<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.700> called<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> twilight

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
cameras have it's called like a twilight

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
cameras have it's called like a twilight
mode<00:02:09.989> or<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> nighttime<00:02:10.470> mode<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.520> uses<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
mode or a nighttime mode where it uses a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
mode or a nighttime mode where it uses a
flash<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.440> keeps<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
flash but then keeps the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160 
flash but then keeps the
door<00:02:14.250> open<00:02:14.549> in<00:02:14.760> order<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.090> expose<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.870> dark

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
door open in order to expose the dark

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.690 
door open in order to expose the dark
background<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> creates<00:02:17.340> actually

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
background and it creates actually

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.920 
background and it creates actually
interesting<00:02:18.000> effects<00:02:18.329> so<00:02:18.659> if<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
interesting effects so if you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.289 
interesting effects so if you
unwittingly<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.069> mode<00:02:20.430> you'll<00:02:21.090> take

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
unwittingly are in this mode you'll take

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.539 
unwittingly are in this mode you'll take
a<00:02:21.329> flash<00:02:21.750> picture<00:02:22.319> which<00:02:22.890> does<00:02:23.159> keep

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
a flash picture which does keep

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.059 
a flash picture which does keep
everything<00:02:24.109> sharpen<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:25.260> focus<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> not

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
everything sharpen and focus and not

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.309 
everything sharpen and focus and not
blurred<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.450> get<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.719> two-second

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
blurred and then you get the two-second

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.959 
blurred and then you get the two-second
exposure<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:29.099> as<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.459> move<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.790> camera

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
exposure and as you move the camera

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.309 
exposure and as you move the camera
around<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:30.629> these<00:02:30.720> streaks<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.140> light

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
around you get these streaks of light

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.020 
around you get these streaks of light
going<00:02:31.500> around<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.250> film<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:32.609> that<00:02:32.730> creates

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
going around the film so that creates

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.119 
going around the film so that creates
this<00:02:33.180> sort<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.750> two<00:02:33.989> images<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.590> top<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:34.920> each

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
this sort of two images on top of each

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.970 
this sort of two images on top of each
other<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:36.239> one<00:02:36.659> unblurred<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:37.739> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
other one it one unblurred and then a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.250 
other one it one unblurred and then a
blurred<00:02:38.400> light<00:02:38.879> sources<00:02:39.239> whatever<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
blurred light sources whatever is in the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.569 
blurred light sources whatever is in the
view<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.829> funny<00:02:41.040> thing<00:02:41.220> about<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.549> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
view and the funny thing about is that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.129 
view and the funny thing about is that
when<00:02:41.939> I<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.269> when<00:02:42.389> we<00:02:42.510> saw<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.019> was<00:02:43.109> a

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
when I think when we saw that it was a

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.619 
when I think when we saw that it was a
two-second<00:02:44.010> exposure<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.700> all<00:02:44.819> thought<00:02:45.060> well

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
two-second exposure we all thought well

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.809 
two-second exposure we all thought well
why<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.079> this<00:02:46.439> guy<00:02:46.709> writing<00:02:47.159> in<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.459> us<00:02:47.609> and

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
why is this guy writing in to us and

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.039 
why is this guy writing in to us and
lying<00:02:48.120> about<00:02:49.430> staging<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.760> photo<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.510> but

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
lying about staging this photo and but

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.809 
lying about staging this photo and but
it<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.680> didn't<00:02:53.069> make<00:02:53.189> sense<00:02:53.250> at<00:02:53.730> all

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
it just it didn't make sense at all

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.920 
it just it didn't make sense at all
because<00:02:54.000> he<00:02:54.090> seemed<00:02:54.329> like<00:02:54.419> a<00:02:54.480> perfectly

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
because he seemed like a perfectly

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.500 
because he seemed like a perfectly
normal<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.379> nice<00:02:55.470> guy<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.819> happily<00:02:57.209> it

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
normal and nice guy and so happily it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.210 
normal and nice guy and so happily it
turns<00:02:57.720> out<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.989> he<00:02:58.109> is<00:02:58.139> in<00:02:58.470> fact<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.829> perfectly

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
turns out that he is in fact a perfectly

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.860 
turns out that he is in fact a perfectly
normal<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.609> nice<00:02:59.730> guy<00:02:59.939> who<00:03:00.000> was<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.389> lying<00:03:00.659> to

normal and nice guy who was not lying to
us<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.379> then<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> clencher<00:03:02.250> was<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> mic

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.690 
us and then the clencher was that a mic
actually<00:03:04.139> duplicated<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.129> picture<00:03:05.430> almost

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700

identically<00:03:06.419> it's<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.139> fantastic<00:03:08.010> what<00:03:08.129> he

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
identically it's it's fantastic what he

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.949 
identically it's it's fantastic what he
produced<00:03:08.609> now<00:03:09.090> what<00:03:09.299> do<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.419> think<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:09.750> he

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
produced now what do you think if he

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.289 
produced now what do you think if he
brought<00:03:10.139> these<00:03:10.349> pictures<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.700> ghost

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
brought these pictures to the ghost

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.940 
brought these pictures to the ghost
society<00:03:12.750> any<00:03:12.870> ghost<00:03:13.169> society<00:03:13.739> could<00:03:13.889> you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
society any ghost society could you

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.289 
society any ghost society could you
imagine<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.489> feedback<00:03:14.879> you<00:03:15.030> would<00:03:15.150> eat

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
anyone's opinion on I respect the most

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.099 
anyone's opinion on I respect the most
when<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.150> comes<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:57.510> these<00:03:57.599> things<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:58.049> would

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
when it comes to these things it would

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.539 
when it comes to these things it would
be<00:03:58.260> Joe<00:03:58.439> Nickell<00:03:58.829> well<00:03:59.189> we<00:03:59.280> could<00:03:59.430> certainly

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
be Joe Nickell well we could certainly

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.399 
be Joe Nickell well we could certainly
make<00:03:59.729> I'm<00:03:59.939> aware<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.239> this<00:04:00.599> but<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.199> that

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
make I'm aware of this but I think that

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.140 
make I'm aware of this but I think that
we've<00:04:01.889> totally<00:04:02.370> nailed<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:02.760> mister<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.090> don't

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
we've totally nailed this mister I don't

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.000 
we've totally nailed this mister I don't
think<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.389> anything<00:04:03.840> left<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.650> explain

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
think is anything left really to explain

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.479 
think is anything left really to explain
about<00:04:05.129> it

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
about it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.979 
about it
yeah<00:04:05.669> I<00:04:05.699> think<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.970> important<00:04:06.389> thing<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.750> that

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
yeah I think the important thing is that

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.629 
yeah I think the important thing is that
now<00:04:07.169> we've<00:04:07.620> got<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.040> out<00:04:08.159> there<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.519> this

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
now we've got that out there that this

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.520 
now we've got that out there that this
