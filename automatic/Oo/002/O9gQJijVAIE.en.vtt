with the chain cleanup we just spray it
on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.579> chain<00:00:38.850> we're<00:00:39.660> spraying<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.170> the

on the chain we're spraying it on the
top<00:00:40.530> side<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> chain<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.910> we're

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
top side of the chain and then we're

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
top side of the chain and then we're
going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> spray<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> the

going to want to spray it down on the
bottom<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> chain<00:00:44.539> we're<00:00:45.539> inside

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
bottom side of the chain we're inside

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
bottom side of the chain we're inside
and<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:47.399> turns<00:00:47.670> into<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> foam<00:00:48.300> ish<00:00:48.960> goo<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and it turns into a foam ish goo that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
and it turns into a foam ish goo that
way<00:00:50.789> when<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> pull<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.510> chain<00:00:51.840> brush<00:00:52.050> out

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
way when you pull your chain brush out

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
way when you pull your chain brush out
it's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.649> dried<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.460> still<00:00:53.940> on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's not all dried up it's still on

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's not all dried up it's still on
there<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.719> take<00:00:55.289> chain<00:00:55.800> brush<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
there so you just take chain brush and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
there so you just take chain brush and
run<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> around<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> chain<00:00:57.989> pushing<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
run it around on the chain pushing it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.119 
run it around on the chain pushing it
inward<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.309> clean<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> outer<00:01:00.149> links<00:01:01.129> upward

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
inward to clean the outer links upward

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
inward to clean the outer links upward
to<00:01:02.730> clean<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:04.379> those

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to clean you know get down into those

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
to clean you know get down into those
links<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.339> good<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.549> clean<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
links and get them good and clean but

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
links and get them good and clean but
you're<00:01:06.780> also<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.860> spin

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you're also going to want to do is spin

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
you're also going to want to do is spin
it<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.210> other<00:01:09.240> direction<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.290> give

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it the other direction this will give

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.230 
it the other direction this will give
those<00:01:10.680> bristles<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> everything<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> chance

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
those bristles and everything a chance

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
those bristles and everything a chance
to<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> other<00:01:13.619> side

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to actually get up in the other side

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
to actually get up in the other side
because<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> chain<00:01:15.210> passes<00:01:15.600> through<00:01:15.780> it's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
because as a chain passes through it's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.590 
because as a chain passes through it's
only<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> clean<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.070> side

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
only going to clean on that one side

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
procedure push down on the chain pull it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.090 
procedure push down on the chain pull it
out<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:24.869> pushing<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.229> push<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
out as you're pushing down push it in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
point what I would recommend is just let

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.650 
point what I would recommend is just let
the<00:02:47.079> chain<00:02:47.319> dry<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:48.040> little<00:02:48.280> bit<00:02:48.510> drip<00:02:49.510> off

the chain dry a little bit drip off

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.059 
the chain dry a little bit drip off
maybe<00:02:49.930> put<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.349> gear<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.829> run<00:02:51.040> it

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
maybe put it in gear and just run it

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.610 
maybe put it in gear and just run it
fling<00:02:51.430> off<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> little<00:02:51.790> bit<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:53.170> next<00:02:53.349> thing

this is how I do it spraying it on the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.740 
this is how I do it spraying it on the
top<00:03:54.220> gets<00:03:54.489> pretty<00:03:54.819> much<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.180> whole<00:03:55.269> top<00:03:55.540> side

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
top gets pretty much the whole top side

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.370 
top gets pretty much the whole top side
of<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.840> chain

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
of the chain

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.909 
of the chain
then<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:58.299> know<00:03:58.419> obviously<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.139> made<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.470> mess<00:03:59.739> so

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
then you know obviously I made a mess so

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.550 
then you know obviously I made a mess so
I'm<00:04:00.040> going<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.220> wipe<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.489> off<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:02.290> know<00:04:02.319> got

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.089 
off all my chain guides and stuff like
that<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.660> once<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.349> get<00:04:08.470> all<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.709> wiped<00:04:08.950> down

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
just spray it on the bottom side of that

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.430 
just spray it on the bottom side of that
chain<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.739> way<00:04:15.130> we<00:04:15.790> have<00:04:16.440> lubrication

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
chain so that way we have lubrication

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.839 
chain so that way we have lubrication
all<00:04:17.530> over<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.859> chain<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.489> particular
