00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
forth so it'll just make kind of a very

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
forth so it'll just make kind of a very
small<00:00:59.600> gathering<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
know it's really gathered the fabric

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
is a very quick way and since I was

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.700 
is a very quick way and since I was
making<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.380> garment<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.549> large<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.960> my

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
making a garment that was so large if my

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.230 
making a garment that was so large if my
spacing<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.729> wasn't<00:01:24.119> very

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
spacing was off it wasn't very

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
spacing was off it wasn't very
noticeable<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.170> you're<00:01:25.799> making<00:01:26.189> something

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
noticeable if you're making something

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
noticeable if you're making something
that's<00:01:27.770> smaller<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> blouse<00:01:29.750> then<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's smaller like a blouse then and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
that's smaller like a blouse then and
you're<00:01:31.770> smoking<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.579> closer<00:01:32.970> together<00:01:33.210> then

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you're smoking is closer together then

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330 
you're smoking is closer together then
you<00:01:33.689> might<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.530> measure<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you might want to measure out the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
you might want to measure out the
distances<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.479> marks<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
to go through is cut the threads and if

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.009 
to go through is cut the threads and if
you<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.249> the<00:03:52.519> same<00:03:52.849> thread<00:03:53.810> as<00:03:54.200> your<00:03:56.019> fabric

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
you have the same thread as your fabric

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.690 
you have the same thread as your fabric
you<00:03:57.530> don't<00:03:57.739> even<00:03:57.889> really<00:03:58.129> have<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.549> do<00:03:58.670> this

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
you don't even really have to do this

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.979 
you don't even really have to do this
the<00:03:59.120> fact<00:03:59.420> sometimes<00:03:59.689> it<00:04:00.200> helps<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:01.959> make<00:04:02.959> the

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
the fact sometimes it helps to make the

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.309 
the fact sometimes it helps to make the
fabric<00:04:03.590> more<00:04:04.000> ruched<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.510> think<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.109> face

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
fabric more ruched I think the face

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.990 
fabric more ruched I think the face
Roush<00:04:07.329> Roush<00:04:08.329> together<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:12.560> up<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.739> you

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000

obviously<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.239> thread<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:15.500> used<00:04:15.889> a<00:04:16.539> different

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
obviously this thread I used a different

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.629 
obviously this thread I used a different
color<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.109> can<00:04:18.259> see<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.590> better<00:04:18.949> on<00:04:19.340> this

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
color so you can see it better on this

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.909 
color so you can see it better on this
effort<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:20.359> it's<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.109> same<00:04:21.229> color<00:04:21.650> as

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
effort but it's not the same color as

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.830 
effort but it's not the same color as
the<00:04:21.979> fabric<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:22.880> stuff<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.300> don't<00:04:23.509> want<00:04:23.660> all

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.469 
you can choose to cut these or not cut
them<00:04:39.620> if<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.830> don't<00:04:39.889> cut<00:04:40.699> them<00:04:40.849> actually<00:04:41.150> it

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
them if you don't cut them actually it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.060
