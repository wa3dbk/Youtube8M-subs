00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.240
 Hello friends and Andrei Nightingales 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.710
 seeing off the power of experimental videos in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.360
 whom we meet with different 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.550
 electronic technology so to speak 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.289
 live mode, but they are not moving away from the box office 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 today we are in electronic 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.570
 discounter sitilink 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.580
 I had the opportunity 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.430
 meet very interesting 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 ultrabook it's called asus ux32vd in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.620
 something we did not pay attention 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.660
 a laptop 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.390
 or rather the most dynamically developing 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 the ultrabook class of these devices 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.220
 This class of devices as well as myself 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.199
 the term ultrabooks will come up with a company 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.470
 Kenton launched with a light hand in 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.180
 free swimming a year ago 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.869
 what must the real answer 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.629
 ultrabook 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.299
 and what is the difference between a laptop and 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.330
 for example netbook first prefix 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.010
 ultra implies that this device 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.260
 ultra thin ultra light and natural 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.880
 ultra portable everything is the most ultra 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.710
 turns into the rules 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.109
 aluminum case weighing no more 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.380
 one and a half kilograms screen diagonal 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:17.299
 no more than 13 inches all that is less 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.520
 unspoken tradition refers class he 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.979
 netbooks and everything is more than usual 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.079
 laptop what happened is interesting for 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.759
 that year so far the ultrabooks are sold in 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.130
 stores on firstly they are significantly 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.420
 matured they got rid of children 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.850
 illnesses got a lot 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.439
 interesting and useful features there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.170
 the machine that is now with me 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.270
 in the hands is called asus x series 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 it weighs really about 1 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.340
 kilograms 450 grams about the widest 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 its thickness does not exceed 18 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.539
 millimeters by the way what's interesting is everything 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.770
 Ultrabooks differ in that they do not have 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.380
 optical drive 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.030
 this drive is gradually leaving in 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.549
 the story 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.530
 the unix series was no exception 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.880
 made of metal and looks and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.740
 feels right here 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.659
 cool but before we turn on 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.189
 let's see what connectors are in his 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.009
 on the sides of the left side is 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.569
 connector usb 30 it is celebrated like this 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.209
 Here is a blue insert to not confuse 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.400
 his accidentally immediately beaten 20 further goes 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.870
 multiformat card reader and proper 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.970
 everything on the left is nothing else 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.410
 interesting if you turn the device 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 the other side then opens here 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.830
 much more interesting picture here 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.970
 located connector for 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.160
 headphone 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.470
 further connector for external 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.319
 monitor then full hdmi output 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 and having specification 1.4 that is 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.040
 TV-enabled and full 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.099
 hd 1080p 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.500
 Next come the next 2 ports yusb st 30 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.769
 and that device has as many as three 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.880
 ports are located on two sides and 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.200
 the last connector is nothing more than just 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360
 power plug 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.130
 no mouse connectors left or right 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.650
 Neither the front nor the back of the device has 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.660
 Is that so you can mark on the back 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.780
 wall 2 speakers are located with two 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 sides and actually facing the ends on 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.079
 where is the power button you ask 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.660
 it turns out she is inside on 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.980
 the keyboard in the upper right also 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.170
 It is worth noting that the keyboard is here 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.850
 has a backlight and the touchpad is resolved as 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 one solid plate 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.350
 divided into left and right button 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.329
 only visually quite interesting 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.859
 constructive solution related to the system 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.350
 cooling thing is that this one 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.739
 ventilation grill introduces hot 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.299
 air from the processor into the gap between 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.970
 loops on which the matrix is attached 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.739
 display in this way even if you 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.459
 put a laptop on some kind of soft 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.380
 surface 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.660
 it will not overheat because 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.170
 the air will be where to go now I'm 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.940
 I suggest to start all this piece and while 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.350
 it loads see what's in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.790
 box because it's worth it too 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.069
 attention worth noting cool 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.500
 the package is that the laptop is designed 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.690
 live here in such a curious fabric 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.730
 envelopes in the same envelopes for example 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.170
 stored and still various accessories checks 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.630
 there is even such a special one 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.730
 pocket in which are located just 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.010
 such adapters one of them allows 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.870
 from its port itself getting networked 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.799
 rj-45 adapter to connect to 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.950
 local network 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.020
 and the second 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.420
 connector is nothing but an exit to that 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.239
 the monitor itself and the output it has svg 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.010
 but the power adapter unfortunately this 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.290
 cheholchik and devoid of and in all likelihood 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.209
 forced to live and hang around the bag 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.250
 self-sufficient than that in the middle 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.470
 boxes located paper envelopes 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.019
 inside of which we find the warranty 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.180
 coupon various instructions and here such 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.790
 Here is a strap that allows you to twist 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.260
 wound cord on this probably about 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.650
 enough packaging 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.740
 and we can go directly 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.050
 familiarity with the apparatus and so here he is 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.850
 already loaded as I said 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.470
 This model is equipped with a 13-inch 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.000
 matrix and not very high resolution 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.400
 only 1366 by 768 pixels but 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.910
 the screen is matt and has not bad angles 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.169
 a view of 178 degrees horizontally at that 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.210
 another interesting trend 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.979
 recent time it can be noted that 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.270
 matt screen and used as a rule 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.060
 in professional models 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.740
 all multimedia gaming laptops like 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.270
 the rule is to be equipped with glossy 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.979
 screens by the way exchange for 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.289
 professional non-gaming application 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.280
 this model can talk about 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.710
 the video card is simple 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.630
 integrated intel hd 3000 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.280
 no problem when working with office 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.050
 programs or internet surfing 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.120
 Of course you will not feel but 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.950
 run here heavy toys i wouldn't 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.840
 began to recommend with regard to 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.080
 characteristics then our machine is built 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.840
 on intel core i3 2367 processor 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.400
 m which runs on frequency 1 and 4 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.720
 gigahertz but 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.460
 equipped with four gigabytes 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.260
 random access memory 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.900
 and quite fast didiart 3 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.610
 operating at a frequency of 1600 megahertz, but 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.229
 overall by the way a good quick-fire 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.590
 The system is affected by the fact that 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.200
 the operating system here is 64-bit 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.360
 and winch with three 320 gigabytes of their capacity 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.970
 has a special flash buffer capacity 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.690
 20 4 gigabytes which is used for 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.950
 cache 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.080
 that's why the performance index 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.220
 which exposes windows 7 to the most 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.349
 its low purpose 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.930
 has 5 2 and it is delivered 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.800
 the processor is that this machine 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.639
 just a series 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.340
 x32 comes from 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.330
 powerful stones like bark and even 5 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.340
 core i7 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.080
 what else can you say about this machine 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.729
 Well, firstly, what's the battery here 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.580
 as is traditional now for many 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.139
 devices fixed here it is 6 ethical 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.139
 allows him to hold out on average 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.789
 about 5-6 hours offline and in 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.889
 first of all thanks not too 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.800
 fast but not too lived 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.439
 any process is also something for example 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.449
 bluetooth here has an interface already 40 a 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:35.169
 Wi-Fi adapter works 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.789
 hv4 ranges abe same and even n one more 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.550
 interesting feature is hidden under 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.069
 Arrow keys here written audio 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.779
 bytes bank anderson and from power and this 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.279
 which means that the audio system 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.139
 equipped with this device at 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.150
 least projected famous 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.250
 acoustic company but only 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.259
 check how good it sounds in 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.330
 such a huge hall does not appear 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.189
 no possibility if you are not yet 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.020
 Do you understand how good or bad this is? 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.729
 the machine, then I can finish you with one 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.629
 small arguments this argument 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.550
 called price 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:06.339
 the fact is that the retail value of this 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.620
 pieces are in the range of 30 thousand rubles 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.810
 if exact around 27 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.180
 imagine that for this money you 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.069
 get very functional very 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.589
 beautiful and very impressive machine 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:20.649
 although not too fast as I said 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:23.080
 ultrabooks in general and asus x series in 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:25.029
 particular is very good 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.460
 choice for the modern businessman 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:30.069
 if you theoretically arrange from 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.289
 a diagonal of 13 inches there is such a choice on 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:34.240
 my mind looks very justified
