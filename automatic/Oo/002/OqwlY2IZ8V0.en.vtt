00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.579 

this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.220> my<00:00:02.340> first<00:00:02.730> bookbinding<00:00:03.720> project<00:00:04.350> and

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is my first bookbinding project and

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.849 
this is my first bookbinding project and
I've<00:00:04.799> got<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> book<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.830> separated<00:00:07.830> from

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
I've got a book that is separated from

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.530 
I've got a book that is separated from
the<00:00:08.189> cover<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:09.240> I'll<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.200> using<00:00:11.179> some<00:00:12.179> book

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the cover so I'll be using some book

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.829 
the cover so I'll be using some book
repair<00:00:13.019> type<00:00:13.380> some<00:00:14.009> gummed<00:00:14.610> book<00:00:15.150> repair<00:00:15.509> type

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
repair type some gummed book repair type

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
repair type some gummed book repair type
and<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.289> sure<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.680> did<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.310> but

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and I'm not sure if I did this right but

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.029 
and I'm not sure if I did this right but
I<00:00:17.789> basically<00:00:18.720> will<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.080> using<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I basically will be using that in

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.939 
I basically will be using that in
conjunction<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:23.449> some<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.949> bookbinding

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
conjunction with some just bookbinding

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.109 
conjunction with some just bookbinding
glue<00:00:26.449> and<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.640> works<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
glue and so I think the way it works is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.709 
glue and so I think the way it works is
the<00:00:30.269> gum<00:00:30.510> helps<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.550> cloth<00:00:32.910> stick<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the gum helps the cloth stick to the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
the gum helps the cloth stick to the
glue<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> good<00:00:35.460> project

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
glue and all that so it's a good project

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080 
glue and all that so it's a good project
so<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.570> done<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.100> I've<00:00:38.100> taken<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so what I've done is I've taken the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.680 
so what I've done is I've taken the
binding<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.230> taken<00:00:40.530> three<00:00:40.950> strips<00:00:41.520> of

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
binding and I've taken three strips of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.590 
binding and I've taken three strips of
the<00:00:42.690> gummed<00:00:42.989> line<00:00:43.620> code<00:00:44.010> tape<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.149> actually

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the gummed line code tape it's actually

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.799 
the gummed line code tape it's actually
only<00:00:47.480> one<00:00:48.480> strip<00:00:48.930> wide<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.670> read<00:00:51.300> somewhere

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
only one strip wide but I read somewhere

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
only one strip wide but I read somewhere
that<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.469> needed<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:55.050> much<00:00:55.500> gum<00:00:56.219> tape

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that I needed to have as much gum tape

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
that I needed to have as much gum tape
as<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> book<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> wide<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> figured<00:00:58.710> I'd

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
as the book is wide so I figured I'd

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
as the book is wide so I figured I'd
reinforce<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.000> third<00:01:00.359> piece<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
reinforce it with a third piece so I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
reinforce it with a third piece so I
have<00:01:01.199> two<00:01:01.469> pieces<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> center<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
have two pieces going to the center or I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
have two pieces going to the center or I
have<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.870> piece<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> center<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
have one piece going to the center of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
have one piece going to the center of
the<00:01:05.430> binding<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.939> each<00:01:06.299> side<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.650> put

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the binding on each side and then I put

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
the binding on each side and then I put
a<00:01:07.979> third<00:01:08.250> piece<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> top<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
a third piece over the top and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.070 
a third piece over the top and
underneath<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.790> gum<00:01:12.000> side<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.659> put

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
underneath that on the gum side I put

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320 
underneath that on the gum side I put
the<00:01:13.229> glue<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.340> bottom<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the glue on the bottom and put that on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260

in behind it and my goal is on the pad

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
in behind it and my goal is on the pad
on<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.310> fingertip<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.299> put<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> glue

gum tape is going to sit underneath that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
gum tape is going to sit underneath that
flap<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> inside<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> binding

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
flap on the inside so I had the binding

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
flap on the inside so I had the binding
secured<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> gum<00:01:56.610> tape<00:01:56.939> I'll<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
secured with the gum tape I'll have the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
secured with the gum tape I'll have the
gum<00:01:58.110> tape<00:01:58.549> secured<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.180> inside<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> the
