00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.869
 cantinflas 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.869
 Meet Julius Caesar 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.019
 here are my pigeons 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.059
 It seems you have bad luck with your cantinflas camera 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.390
 yes and what happens is that the woman was chased by pigeons 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.970
 but it hits me to investigate the statues are equal 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.189
 Gijón 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 but if the city of Rome is full of structures 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.850
 and romo is very old and its history is full of important people 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.320
 maybe someday games for two 'mine for once 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.540
 good if you do something that makes you famous as a Cesar tetan a statute 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.970
 the care you have not heard about Caesar 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.970

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.550

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.440

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.810

 sojeros that's my name dump 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.720
 do not throw oppression in test and the lands of the ebro because yes already has 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.900
 too long 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.410
 I do not mean to take a walk this old city has changed since I was 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.430
 commanding 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.480
 when we govern from roma 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.100
 before gmt I was appointed supreme head of Rome back in the year 49 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.230
 1949 the 49 before Christ 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.210
 VICTOR VIGO WILL TEACH YOU 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.140
 papa daddy take me to the year 49 before Christ objects like the Spanish base 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 said trichet 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 wherever you go do what you see 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 monterrey is much better dressed so in the opinion of plane I feel very well 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 watch out 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 the beginning of the revolt in the year 65 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.959
 was appointed director of public works and game without title and all kinds of 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 recreations for the good citizens of Rome 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.289
 but caspe to the last penny of the budget in the construction of these 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 fun centers the town loved 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.089
 ready to follow 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.089
 Well, of course, if I'm in perfect order 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.399
 a temporary delay 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.319
 It also happened a couple of years ago and I thought that if I wanted to succeed as 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220
 politician was going to need a little help 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.139
 of cantinflas allows to represent each case eaton fe 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.500
 we formed the first triumvirate a governing board of three 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.530
 the government has shown more together for several years 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.489
 but I have to confess your age I do not like to share 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.549
 It does not have to be mockery or st you like that I wanted to be the mere grouper exactly 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.659
 I thought that the only way to achieve it was to make it famous and in my time 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.150
 the best way was to become a hero on the battlefield 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.249
 on the battlefield 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.279
 can you and I what am I doing in this costume pedro is a soldier me 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.529
 I led thousands of soldiers and conquered all kinds of nations like England and 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:23.909
 France 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.299
 you must mean he was in battles with swords and those things 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.159
 my soldiers were fighting against Rome enemies 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.169
 but I am a peaceful man and friends from around the world 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.719
 my success only lost all battled moves one year 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.749
 when I'm very happy 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.189
 with you 11 sun 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.799
 via roma has become law 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.430
 a nice soldiers who had anything that is ordered 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.670
 like who says in rome 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.620
 everybody adored him l 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.290
 well not really all the pompeyo public metheny activity succeeded 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.080
 convince a lot of people that I intended to make them laugh so that 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.969
 we had a small civil war between the two 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.319
 so I took my troops and chased Pompey and his people to Egypt 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 the people wanted to name merreikh of course I was offered the crown three times 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 but I rejected it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.800
 and because then very nice to be a victim or tells us to prefer to be 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.539
 lifelong ruling dictator 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.539
 good and wanted as a ruler 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.520
 public service and if that cartel all those counted 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.630
 travel all the roads to Rome to build hundreds of libraries 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.460
 public institutions dismissed many dishonest governors regale cereals 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.510
 to the poor 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080
 including better the calendar to take better account of the time 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.520
 others I think I have to go to the Senate 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.490
 I wanted that and cantinflas 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.139
 josé güemes that is March 15th so today I can give a speech 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.830
 and who are these gentlemen are Roman senators 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.189
 friends of caesar 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.629
 you know I do not want to tell you this but March 15 was a fateful day 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.619
 those men fear that someday Caesar will be named a tower and implanted 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.529
 we caught 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.529
 prevent 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:28.069
 they will not hurt again no friends 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.069
 with friends so one does not need enemies 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.810
 adicae haiti ps it was agreed to stop be careful for cantinflas wake up is 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.210
 suffering a nightmare friend 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.210
 there yes that would weigh sr 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.379
 we dream of being famous enough so that cristian of statues 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.270
 this plan has decided that he does not want to be famous 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.939
 does not want to be like the great July Caesar 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.469
 that is not to be seen, it is not necessary to be very comfortable, I think that with 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.829
 Caesar will agree to my popcorn themes for them in their pain sometimes 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:05.550
 we do
