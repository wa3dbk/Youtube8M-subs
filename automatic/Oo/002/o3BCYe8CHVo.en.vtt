00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
the most annoying thing about fighting

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
the most annoying thing about fighting
Gazzara<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.530> he<00:02:32.680> always<00:02:33.070> backs<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.610> into

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
Gazzara is that he always backs you into

Gazzara is that he always backs you into
a<00:02:33.940> corner<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.480> starts<00:02:34.840> smashing<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.530> with

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
it sounds and of course he did it when I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.230 
it sounds and of course he did it when I
fought<00:02:52.810> him<00:02:52.890> only<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.100> some<00:02:54.340> reason<00:02:54.820> this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
fought him only for some reason this

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.480 
fought him only for some reason this
caused<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.840> game<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.110> glitch<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.800> because

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
caused the game to glitch up because

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.400 
caused the game to glitch up because
once<00:02:57.730> he<00:02:57.940> started<00:02:58.270> smacking<00:02:58.840> me<00:02:58.960> he<00:02:59.200> never

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
fight in about 40 seconds but this

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.280 
fight in about 40 seconds but this
lasted<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:05.740> nearly<00:03:05.890> five<00:03:06.280> minutes<00:03:07.260> after<00:03:08.260> a

lasted for nearly five minutes after a
while<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.920> graphics<00:03:09.490> started<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.940> mess<00:03:10.150> up

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
while the graphics started to mess up

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.570 
while the graphics started to mess up
with<00:03:10.990> little<00:03:11.350> red<00:03:11.500> blocks<00:03:11.950> all<00:03:12.250> over<00:03:12.490> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
with little red blocks all over the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.870 
with little red blocks all over the
place<00:03:13.350> which<00:03:14.350> was<00:03:14.620> weird<00:03:14.920> because<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.520> just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
place which was weird because I just

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.910 
place which was weird because I just
took<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.210> game<00:03:16.390> out<00:03:16.600> blew<00:03:17.230> on<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.770> then

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
took the game out blew on it and then

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.400 
took the game out blew on it and then
started<00:03:18.310> again<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.880> wasn't<00:03:19.720> about<00:03:19.990> to<00:03:20.050> let<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
started again I wasn't about to let a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.440 
started again I wasn't about to let a
little<00:03:20.860> glitch<00:03:21.220> stand<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.820> my<00:03:22.030> way

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
little glitch stand in my way

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.020 
little glitch stand in my way
so<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.750> started<00:03:23.170> again<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:24.040> time<00:03:24.370> defeated

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
so I started again this time defeated

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
so I started again this time defeated

was on to the next planet Mars I browse

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.330 
was on to the next planet Mars I browse
around<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.260> board<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.709> found<00:03:35.950> something

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
around the board and found something

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.630 
around the board and found something
unexpected<00:03:37.470> where<00:03:38.470> Varun's<00:03:38.980> piece<00:03:39.310> should

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
unexpected where Varun's piece should

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.670 
unexpected where Varun's piece should
have<00:03:39.760> been<00:03:40.000> there<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.570> instead<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.320> piece

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
have been there was instead a piece

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.390 
have been there was instead a piece
representing<00:03:42.520> Titanosaurus<00:03:43.890> there<00:03:44.890> was<00:03:45.040> only

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
representing Titanosaurus there was only

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.210 
representing Titanosaurus there was only
ten<00:03:45.730> kaiju<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> game<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.870> titanosaurs<00:03:47.860> is

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
ten kaiju in the game and titanosaurs is

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.620 
ten kaiju in the game and titanosaurs is
not<00:03:48.820> one<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.300> them<00:03:49.560> or<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.890> thought<00:03:51.630> perhaps

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
not one of them or so I thought perhaps

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.690 
not one of them or so I thought perhaps
titanosaurs<00:03:53.380> was<00:03:53.620> originally<00:03:54.130> intended<00:03:54.490> to

be<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.270> game<00:03:55.480> but<00:03:55.750> was<00:03:55.959> swapped<00:03:56.440> out<00:03:56.680> with

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
be in the game but was swapped out with

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.330 
be in the game but was swapped out with
Varon<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.430> some<00:03:57.580> reason<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.470> began<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.130> feel

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
Varon for some reason so I began to feel

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.030 
Varon for some reason so I began to feel
very<00:04:00.670> excited<00:04:01.090> not<00:04:01.840> only<00:04:02.260> was<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.560> playing<00:04:02.860> my

Titanosaurus<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.490> was<00:05:31.700> worried<00:05:32.090> as<00:05:32.210> to

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
Titanosaurus and I was worried as to

what<00:05:32.540> kind<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:32.990> glitches<00:05:33.320> would<00:05:33.650> happen<00:05:34.040> this

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
what kind of glitches would happen this

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.210 
what kind of glitches would happen this
time<00:05:34.720> but<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.750> my<00:05:35.990> surprise<00:05:36.220> titanosaurs

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
time but to my surprise titanosaurs

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.640 
time but to my surprise titanosaurs
looked<00:05:37.550> just<00:05:37.790> fine<00:05:38.090> although<00:05:38.930> all<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.410> game's

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
looked just fine although all the game's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.850 
looked just fine although all the game's
bipedal<00:05:40.280> monsters<00:05:40.760> were<00:05:40.970> at<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.180> same<00:05:41.510> height

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860

titanosaurs<00:05:42.860> was<00:05:43.130> a<00:05:43.160> bit<00:05:43.400> taller<00:05:43.700> but<00:05:44.020> since

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
titanosaurs was a bit taller but since

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020 
titanosaurs was a bit taller but since
titanosaurs<00:05:45.710> actually<00:05:46.370> was<00:05:46.610> taller<00:05:46.940> than

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
titanosaurs actually was taller than

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
godzilla in his film debut I thought

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.310 
godzilla in his film debut I thought
this<00:05:49.340> was<00:05:49.550> kind<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.790> cool

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
this was kind of cool

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.260 
this was kind of cool
after<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.350> very<00:05:51.590> fun<00:05:51.980> fight<00:05:52.310> with<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.730> monster

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
after a very fun fight with the monster

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.240 
after a very fun fight with the monster
that<00:05:53.300> wasn't<00:05:53.930> supposed<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.470> be<00:05:54.590> in<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.800> game<00:05:55.010> I

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
that wasn't supposed to be in the game I

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.670 
that wasn't supposed to be in the game I
took<00:05:55.669> over<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.120> enemy<00:05:56.419> base<00:05:56.600> and<00:05:56.900> proceeded

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
took over the enemy base and proceeded

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.670 
took over the enemy base and proceeded
not<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:58.160> jupiter-like<00:05:58.669> normal<00:05:59.330> but<00:06:00.230> instead

not to jupiter-like normal but instead
to<00:06:01.610> pathos
