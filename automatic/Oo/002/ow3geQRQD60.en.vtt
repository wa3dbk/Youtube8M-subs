I did not realize today was the full

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.500 
I did not realize today was the full
moon<00:00:06.720> until<00:00:07.080> yesterday<00:00:07.940> so<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> want<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.389> give

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
moon until yesterday so I want to give

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.480 
moon until yesterday so I want to give
you<00:00:09.540> guys<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> quick<00:00:10.080> focus<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.769> was<00:00:10.920> asking<00:00:11.340> what

you guys a quick focus I was asking what

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.060 
you guys a quick focus I was asking what
we<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.849> do<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.809> further<00:00:13.019> anchor<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.710> new

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
we can do to further anchor in the new

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.279 
we can do to further anchor in the new
paradigm<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:15.059> today's<00:00:15.570> full<00:00:15.870> moon<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
paradigm with today's full moon it's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.410 
paradigm with today's full moon it's
full<00:00:16.529> tonight<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:17.160> nine<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:18.029> p.m.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
full tonight at nine something p.m.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.870 
full tonight at nine something p.m.
mountain<00:00:19.080> time<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.670> your<00:00:20.789> own

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
mountain time so look it up on your own

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.130 
mountain time so look it up on your own
calendar<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.510> what<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> what

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
calendar and see what it is and what

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.670 
calendar and see what it is and what
we're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.980> rather<00:00:23.939> than<00:00:24.680> plant

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we're going to do is rather than plant

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.560 
we're going to do is rather than plant
an<00:00:25.949> actual<00:00:26.430> stone<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.029> did<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.359> new

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
an actual stone like we did in the new

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.400 
an actual stone like we did in the new
moon<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.990> few<00:00:28.769> weeks<00:00:28.859> ago<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:30.090> time<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:31.019> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
moon a few weeks ago this time what we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.229 
moon a few weeks ago this time what we
want<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> imagine<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> energy

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
want to imagine is that the energy

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.510 
want to imagine is that the energy
that's<00:00:33.390> rising<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:35.160> reason<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that's rising up because the reason that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.569 
that's rising up because the reason that
the<00:00:35.700> oceans<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.930> water<00:00:37.530> bodies<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> our

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the oceans and the water bodies on our

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
the oceans and the water bodies on our
planet<00:00:38.760> expand<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> moon<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> full<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
planet expand when the moon is full is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.889 
planet expand when the moon is full is
because<00:00:40.910> everything<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> energy<00:00:42.750> there

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
because everything all the energy there

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
because everything all the energy there
is<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> fluffed<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.610> there's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is kind of fluffed up it's not there's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
is kind of fluffed up it's not there's
not<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> they're<00:00:46.140> just

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
not actually more of it they're just

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
not actually more of it they're just
more<00:00:46.440> space<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> between<00:00:47.039> there's<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
more space in between there's like a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000 
more space in between there's like a
bigger<00:00:48.090> scaffold<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.690> created<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
bigger scaffold and created so now that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
bigger scaffold and created so now that
this<00:00:50.100> scaffolding<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.149> why<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.660> we

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this scaffolding is here why don't we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
this scaffolding is here why don't we
build<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.160> high<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.940> try<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
build it up as high as we can try to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
build it up as high as we can try to
feel<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> full<00:00:55.530> moon<00:00:55.710> tonight<00:00:56.039> try<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
feel it the full moon tonight try to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.360 
feel it the full moon tonight try to
feel<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.570> high<00:00:58.170> energy<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:59.100> big

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
feel this high energy this big

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
feel this high energy this big
scaffolding<00:01:00.050> kind<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.289> tree<00:01:01.530> branches

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
scaffolding kind of like tree branches

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.450 
scaffolding kind of like tree branches
all<00:01:02.039> around<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> imbue<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
all around and then into it imbue the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.969 
all around and then into it imbue the
same<00:01:05.700> things<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> gridded<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.290> during

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
same things that we gridded with during

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
same things that we gridded with during
the<00:01:08.100> New<00:01:08.250> Moon<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.780> no<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.080> drama<00:01:10.470> between

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the New Moon so no more drama between

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
the New Moon so no more drama between
good<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.490> evil<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.180> challenge<00:01:12.780> between<00:01:12.960> how

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
good and evil just challenge between how

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
good and evil just challenge between how
amazing<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> create<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.659> when

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
amazing you can create it and also when

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
amazing you can create it and also when
you<00:01:15.960> create<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> energetic<00:01:16.950> scaffolding

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you create this energetic scaffolding

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.350 
you create this energetic scaffolding
make<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.540> personal<00:01:19.110> life<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
make it for your personal life if if we

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.030 
make it for your personal life if if we
all<00:01:21.509> create<00:01:21.810> our<00:01:21.990> own<00:01:22.020> heaven<00:01:22.409> bubbles<00:01:22.860> where

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
all create our own heaven bubbles where

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
all create our own heaven bubbles where
everyone<00:01:23.400> around<00:01:23.610> us<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.170> fulfilled<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
everyone around us is fulfilled and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
everyone around us is fulfilled and
happy<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.810> link<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
happy then we can all link it up and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.630 
happy then we can all link it up and
then<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> sudden<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.070> live<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> heaven

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
then all of a sudden we live in a heaven

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.390 
then all of a sudden we live in a heaven
on<00:01:29.700> earth<00:01:29.759> paradigm<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.799> goes<00:01:32.100> for

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
on earth paradigm and that goes for

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
on earth paradigm and that goes for
their<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.850> being<00:01:33.119> lack<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.720> goes<00:01:33.900> for

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
their not being lack there goes for

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.749 
their not being lack there goes for
their<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.380> being<00:01:34.650> things<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.100> war<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
their not being things like war and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
their not being things like war and
arguments<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.930> remember<00:01:37.320> whatever's<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
arguments because remember whatever's in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
arguments because remember whatever's in
here<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.220> reflected<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.930> we

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
here is reflected out there so if we

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
here is reflected out there so if we
still<00:01:40.470> live<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.979> world<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.549> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
still live in a world where there are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
still live in a world where there are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
then that means that something in our

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
then that means that something in our
projection<00:01:44.640> system<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.450> creates<00:01:45.810> our

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
projection system which creates our

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.069 
projection system which creates our
universe<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.530> own<00:01:46.680> personal<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:48.049> still<00:01:49.049> a

universe our own personal one is still a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
universe our own personal one is still a
little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:49.470> off<00:01:49.619> inside<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> us<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.460> let's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
little bit off inside of us so let's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.870 
little bit off inside of us so let's
just<00:01:51.210> try<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> imagine<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.590> best<00:01:52.920> individual

experiences of life that we possibly can
