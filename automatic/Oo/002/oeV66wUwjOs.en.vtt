00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
spaces of room from the right so like

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.070 
spaces of room from the right so like
this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.859> uh<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> melon<00:00:26.849> seed<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.300> you

this is uh this is a melon seed and you
need<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.410> extra<00:00:28.800> space<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> vine

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
need this extra space because the vine

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
need this extra space because the vine
will<00:00:30.810> grow<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.619> um<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> stick

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
will grow but then um I kind of stick

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
will grow but then um I kind of stick
out<00:00:32.850> towards<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.380> what

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
out towards the right and that's what

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.959 
out towards the right and that's what
the<00:00:34.739> melon<00:00:34.980> will<00:00:35.100> grow<00:00:35.250> no<00:00:35.460> take<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the melon will grow no take up this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:36.950 
the melon will grow no take up this
whole<00:00:36.180> spot<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.570> here

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
whole spot right here

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.130 
whole spot right here
so<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:39.300> takes<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> while<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.750> them<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
so yeah and it takes a while for them to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
so yeah and it takes a while for them to
grow<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.890> almost<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> whole<00:00:41.520> day<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
grow like almost the whole day and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.639 
grow like almost the whole day and
minecraft<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.200> sharing<00:00:43.410> but

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
minecraft I think I'm not sharing but

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.889 
minecraft I think I'm not sharing but
when<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> put<00:00:44.010> bow<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.309> mail<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> looks<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
when you put bow and mail it looks it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.510 
when you put bow and mail it looks it
looks<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> vine<00:00:46.920> you

looks like that that's the vine you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
looks like that that's the vine you
should<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.600> won't<00:00:48.750> want<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
should you probably won't want to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
should you probably won't want to
destroy<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.850> don't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
destroy that because if you don't
