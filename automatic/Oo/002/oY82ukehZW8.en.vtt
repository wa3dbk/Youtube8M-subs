00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
two lines for the mouth go up at an

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.250 
two lines for the mouth go up at an
angle<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> nose<00:00:39.559> pull<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:42.230> pull<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
angle for the nose pull it out pull it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:54.490 
angle for the nose pull it out pull it
through<00:00:44.539> fill<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:48.390> thin<00:00:52.250> Bend<00:00:53.250> there

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
through fill it in to a thin Bend there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.779 
through fill it in to a thin Bend there
thin<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.640> dorsal<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.489> there<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> go

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
thin there the dorsal and there you go

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.770 
thin there the dorsal and there you go
it's<00:01:00.530> funky<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.800> though<00:01:02.480> doing<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's funky because though doing it to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780 
it's funky because though doing it to
this<00:01:03.899> side<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> idea<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.760> just

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
this side but you get the idea you just

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.100 
this side but you get the idea you just
put<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> white<00:01:06.540> eye<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.979> gills<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
put a white eye on some gills and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.399 
put a white eye on some gills and
seriously<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.390> 15-second<00:01:12.390> shark<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
seriously it's like a 15-second shark so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
seriously it's like a 15-second shark so
that's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.369> good<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> your

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that's a really good one to have in your

that's a really good one to have in your
pocket<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.560> ton<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> kids<00:01:17.700> lines

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
