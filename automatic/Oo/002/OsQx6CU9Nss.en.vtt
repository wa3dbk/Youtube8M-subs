00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.449 
because today increased horsepower the
engine<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.350> they<00:02:49.440> put<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.250> bigger

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
engine that they put the bigger

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.550 
engine that they put the bigger
horsepower<00:02:51.000> Briggs<00:02:51.330> engine<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.470> they

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
horsepower Briggs engine in and they

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
horsepower Briggs engine in and they
were<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> first<00:02:52.950> ones<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.370> five<00:02:53.519> six<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
were the first ones at five six so the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.290 
were the first ones at five six so the
first<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.920> calls<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.370> ball<00:02:57.030> lock

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
first one with a it calls a ball lock

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.780 
first one with a it calls a ball lock
clutch<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.200> believe<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.280> positive<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.760> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
clutch I believe the positive is a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.430 
clutch I believe the positive is a
spring-loaded<00:03:00.390> clutch<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> ball<00:03:01.200> lock

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
spring-loaded clutch it was a ball lock

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.500 
spring-loaded clutch it was a ball lock
buzzes<00:03:01.860> ball<00:03:02.070> bearings<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.550> there<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
buzzes ball bearings in there that

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.910 
buzzes ball bearings in there that
engage<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.080> clutch<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:06.530> that's<00:03:07.530> why<00:03:07.739> they

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
engage the clutch and that's why they

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.590 
engage the clutch and that's why they
would<00:03:08.040> call<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> super<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:08.970> they<00:03:09.120> were<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
would call the super because they were a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.720 
would call the super because they were a
little<00:03:10.260> superior<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> ones<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.610> came

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
little superior to the ones that came

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.960 
little superior to the ones that came
before<00:03:11.940> them<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.360> guess<00:03:12.570> you'd<00:03:13.440> say<00:03:13.730> any<00:03:14.730> rate

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
before them I guess you'd say any rate

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.390 
before them I guess you'd say any rate
so<00:03:20.360> everything<00:03:21.360> else<00:03:21.739> once<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.830> get<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.130> baby

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so everything else once I get that baby

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.259 
so everything else once I get that baby
up<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.730> running<00:03:24.380> I'm<00:03:25.380> gonna<00:03:25.590> do<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> video<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:27.030> a

beautifully<00:04:03.040> bolt<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.550> simple<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.630> she<00:04:04.870> has

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
beautifully bolt up simple and she has

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.260 
beautifully bolt up simple and she has
the<00:04:05.260> pulley<00:04:05.740> on<00:04:05.980> there<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.370> was<00:04:06.550> on<00:04:06.820> there<00:04:07.090> on

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
the pulley on there that was on there on

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.630 
the pulley on there that was on there on
the<00:04:07.420> snowblower<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.170> think<00:04:08.980> lines<00:04:09.310> up<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
the snowblower and think lines up the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.010 
the snowblower and think lines up the
perfect<00:04:10.890> pulley<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.060> track<00:04:13.420> if<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.870> works

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
perfect pulley on the track if it works

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.140 
perfect pulley on the track if it works
great
