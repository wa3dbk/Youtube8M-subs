00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
but if you can pick him up in that first

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.020 
but if you can pick him up in that first
season<00:05:56.620> i'm<00:05:56.800> not<00:05:56.980> too<00:05:57.160> sure<00:05:57.190> on<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.640> price<00:05:57.880> of

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
season i'm not too sure on the price of

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.640 
season i'm not too sure on the price of
these<00:05:58.150> players<00:05:58.390> also<00:05:58.570> because<00:05:58.960> obviously<00:05:59.080> the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
these players also because obviously the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.410 
these players also because obviously the
game<00:05:59.860> full<00:06:00.250> game<00:06:00.400> hasn't<00:06:00.640> actually<00:06:00.940> came<00:06:01.300> out

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
game full game hasn't actually came out

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.510 
game full game hasn't actually came out
yet<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:01.660> i<00:06:01.840> think<00:06:01.900> possibly<00:06:02.590> it'll<00:06:03.130> go<00:06:03.250> from

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
yet but i think possibly it'll go from

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.130 
yet but i think possibly it'll go from
five<00:06:03.790> to<00:06:04.060> 10<00:06:04.240> million<00:06:04.420> because<00:06:04.660> obviously<00:06:04.810> and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
five to 10 million because obviously and

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.200 
five to 10 million because obviously and
local<00:06:05.500> law<00:06:05.650> he<00:06:06.040> is<00:06:06.190> definitely<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.610> grip<00:06:07.000> here

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
local law he is definitely a grip here

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.520 
local law he is definitely a grip here
possibly<00:06:07.540> could<00:06:07.780> even<00:06:07.810> get<00:06:08.080> them<00:06:08.230> online<00:06:08.350> in

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
possibly could even get them online in

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.200 
possibly could even get them online in
that<00:06:08.800> first<00:06:09.010> season<00:06:09.190> and<00:06:09.610> i<00:06:09.760> think<00:06:09.940> it'd<00:06:10.060> be<00:06:10.090> a

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
that first season and i think it'd be a

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.540
