this trick called mending and what that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
this trick called mending and what that
is<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> show<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is I'm going to show you how to do that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.939 
is I'm going to show you how to do that
but<00:00:53.610> basically<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.949> showing

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
but basically what it is is it's showing

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.369 
but basically what it is is it's showing
off<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.309> split<00:00:56.670> ends<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.870> trimming

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
off those split ends and just trimming

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
off those split ends and just trimming
them<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.829> rather<00:00:59.670> than<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.420> cutting

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
them off rather than actually cutting

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
them off rather than actually cutting
your<00:01:00.930> hair<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.739> doing<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.340> layers

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your hair and then doing your layers

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.000 
your hair and then doing your layers
because<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.809> tedious<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> I've

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
because that's just tedious and I've

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
because that's just tedious and I've
tried<00:01:05.309> doing<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.790> own<00:01:05.820> layering<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
tried doing my own layering and it's I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.070 
tried doing my own layering and it's I
can<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.790> choose<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.600> because

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
can do it but I don't choose to because

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.070 
can do it but I don't choose to because
I'm<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.000> can't<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.990> I'm

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
they're not as sharp and precise as the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.570 
they're not as sharp and precise as the
professional<00:02:24.480> hair<00:02:24.720> shears<00:02:25.320> use<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.190> salon

professional hair shears use it salon

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.100 
professional hair shears use it salon
but<00:02:27.180> they're<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> lot<00:02:27.600> better<00:02:27.780> than<00:02:28.080> getting

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but they're a lot better than getting

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.800 
but they're a lot better than getting
your<00:02:28.350> kitchen<00:02:28.770> shears<00:02:29.010> okay<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.240> ramp<00:02:30.570> is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
your kitchen shears okay so that ramp is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.250 
your kitchen shears okay so that ramp is
done<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.560> basically<00:02:31.950> what<00:02:32.250> mending<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
done so basically what mending is you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
done so basically what mending is you
take<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.890> section<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.820> hair<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:37.709> hold

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
take a section of your hair and you hold

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.729 
take a section of your hair and you hold
it<00:02:38.070> up<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.750> probably<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> be

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
it up like so it's probably going to be

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.280 
it up like so it's probably going to be
hard<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.160> see<00:02:41.459> on<00:02:41.489> camera<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.080> see

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
hard to see on camera if you can see

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
hard to see on camera if you can see
these<00:02:43.530> little<00:02:43.709> hairs<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.370> sticking<00:02:44.640> up

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
these little hairs that are sticking up

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.229 
these little hairs that are sticking up
I<00:02:45.269> am<00:02:46.050> personally<00:02:46.350> looking<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:47.130> them<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
I am personally looking at them and the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.170 
I am personally looking at them and the
ones<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.140> our<00:02:49.380> split<00:02:49.769> ends<00:02:50.280> that's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
ones that I see our split ends that's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.509 
ones that I see our split ends that's
what<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.510> trimming<00:02:51.780> off<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.340> don't

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
what I'm trimming off you really don't

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.310 
what I'm trimming off you really don't
have<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.820> trim<00:02:54.269> off<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.660> ones<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.989> aren't

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
have to trim off the ones that aren't

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.430 
have to trim off the ones that aren't
split<00:02:55.500> ends<00:02:55.739> because<00:02:56.430> they're<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.630> damaged

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
split ends because they're not damaged

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.410 
split ends because they're not damaged
so<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.400> keep<00:02:59.610> letting<00:02:59.940> those<00:03:00.060> grow

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
so you can keep letting those grow

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.850 
so you can keep letting those grow
especially<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.080> want<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.290> very<00:03:01.470> hair<00:03:01.680> out

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
especially if you want a very hair out

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.070 
especially if you want a very hair out
but<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.730> want<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.180> get<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> ones<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.870> are

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
but you want to get the ones that are

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.920 
but you want to get the ones that are
damaged<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:05.519> them<00:03:05.700> off<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.180> what<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.870> does

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
damaged get them off and what this does

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.840 
damaged get them off and what this does
it<00:03:07.440> helps<00:03:07.769> get<00:03:07.980> rid<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.160> those<00:03:08.250> split<00:03:08.549> ends<00:03:08.700> so

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
it helps get rid of those split ends so

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.000 
it helps get rid of those split ends so
your<00:03:09.000> hair<00:03:09.120> doesn't<00:03:09.150> keep<00:03:09.540> breaking<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
your hair doesn't keep breaking so that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580 
your hair doesn't keep breaking so that
you<00:03:11.459> don't<00:03:11.700> have<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.330> get<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> lot<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:13.290> doff

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you don't have to go get a lot from doff

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.190 
you don't have to go get a lot from doff
next<00:03:13.950> time<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.600> one<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.989> bad

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
next time you go so see that one is bad

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.979 
next time you go so see that one is bad
