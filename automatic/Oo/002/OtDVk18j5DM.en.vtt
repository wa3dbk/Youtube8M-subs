00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.630
 there are very good fictions how are you 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.970
 Welcome once again to my channel and 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.250
 well today I'm here mainly for 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.160
 thank you but good before 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.960
 nothing I want to qualify some temitas 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.730
 good in the previous video in which 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.409
 I warned them about my return to youtube which 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.300
 I leave you here in the annotation above 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.429
 right because I think the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.739
 you lost so many you have noticed in 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.509
 visits and likes it so 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.159
 as I said in that video I told you 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.989
 that I had bought a new computer 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.489
 and therefore the sony configuration 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.399
 vegas that is with the program that I 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.809
 edited it would be different and good in the 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.059
 comments you told me enough 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.109
 different opinions regarding the audio and 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.940
 to the video 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.890
 some told me that you heard very well 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.410
 others who did not listen to me too 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.629
 ones that the video looked very colorful and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 that was pretty cool other than not 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 that they did not like how it was this time 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.829
 so good though I sincerely 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.109
 I saw well how I do not really know what 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.999
 you want in this video I will not touch much 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.589
 the effects of color and I hope that it 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.350
 listen better since I will record with 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.640
 another device and with another program 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.530
 but as I do not promise anything and neither 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.690
 can i do much more please 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.520
 in this video, let me return to you 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.140
 opinions in the comments 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.390
 and if you do not know what I'm telling you about, 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.190
 by the previous video and you will see the color 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.460
 and the audio of my comment to see if you 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.530
 like if I did not qualify this as I said 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.180
 before today I come to thank you for 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.310
 the support that you gave me in the video of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.869
 the whole truth about bis was not 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.180
 amazing the truth without you did 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.159
 for me to broadcast 6 video on networks 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.259
 social networks and YouTube channels 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.810
 I saw it obviously that's why I can 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.759
 affirm what he did that very many 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.020
 youtubers saw my video and many 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.090
 subscribers of these youtubers me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.850
 give an opportunity by subscribing to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.979
 channel better I hope you stay here and not 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.700
 They will be signed only for a video since 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.250
 as you know 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.860
 I am anti inactive subscribers 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.450
 Regarding youtubers I 'm not going to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 name or highlight any special 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.280
 since they are more than 20 important and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.069
 I do not want to name one to leave me to another 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 since this seems like it's 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.420
 underestimating someone so better 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.970
 did not comment any of them but yes 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.459
 I want to clarify that thanks to my video and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.960
 thanks to your broadcast the video 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.790
 it came to these hands 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.710
 and made him end up erasing the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.780
 promotion of the double nuclear to tomorrow 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.540
 you choose bis not and this the truth is that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.580
 it was something that filled me the next day 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.470
 it is abyss as you will know a video went up 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.930
 asking for forgiveness and saying they have their 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.360
 channel there was only one game tomorrow the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.760
 others will be normal when just one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.990
 week before doing that video did 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.610
 another responding to his brother's video 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.400
 saying that in his channel no game 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.620
 it was tomorrow so well one day it says that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780
 does not have any game tomorrow another day 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.910
 he says he only has one if he 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.580
 we find another life that has two and 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.260
 so on because nobody believes 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.300
 have only one game tomorrow in your 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.160
 channel even I have more evidence of 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.380
 which no longer I bring forth the light post 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.300
 that the result is obvious the people who 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.700
 still subscribed to it will continue to be 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.400
 like limpets so this topic I 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.410
 Sincerely, he left it settled and good 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.780
 that I'm going around the bush as you see in the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.760
 title thanks to that video and to you 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.980
 mainly for spreading what I've 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 fulfilled nothing more and nothing less than 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.090
 four dreams on youtube 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.750
 I had in mind since I started climbing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.939
 videos the first that exceed the likes 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.670
 to the visits the physicists stayed 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.459
 set at 301 as they usually stay 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.909
 I always went to sleep when I had 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.090
 800 likes I guess you got over it with 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.340
 you grow other dreams for two others that 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.639
 meet were overcome a thousand likes and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.739
 the two thousand likes I mean incredible and 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.650
 finally the last dream was to appear 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.359
 on the YouTube main page there yes 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.250
 that I was amazed because in the 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.290
 home page only appears in the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.970
 featured videos but the truth is that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.099
 I was almost sure that it would appear 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.799
 since the day I uploaded the video 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.349
 without being narcissistic the subject 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.230

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.079
 messages broadcasting my video which 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.180
