there's<00:00:09.549> been<00:00:09.730> quite<00:00:09.849> a<00:00:09.940> bit<00:00:10.089> of<00:00:10.120> controversy

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
there's been quite a bit of controversy

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.779 
there's been quite a bit of controversy
about<00:00:11.019> where<00:00:11.410> we<00:00:11.620> get<00:00:11.799> stem<00:00:12.099> cells<00:00:12.400> where

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
about where we get stem cells where

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.820 
about where we get stem cells where
anybody<00:00:13.269> gets<00:00:13.480> those<00:00:13.690> there's<00:00:14.230> always<00:00:14.590> the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
anybody gets those there's always the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.260 
anybody gets those there's always the
the<00:00:15.070> argument<00:00:15.639> that<00:00:16.059> you're<00:00:16.150> getting

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
the argument that you're getting

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.999 
the argument that you're getting
embryonic<00:00:16.960> stem<00:00:17.200> cells<00:00:17.470> so<00:00:17.590> you're<00:00:17.740> killing

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009 
embryonic stem cells so you're killing

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
embryonic stem cells so you're killing
babies<00:00:18.310> are<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.520> getting<00:00:18.759> them<00:00:18.849> from

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
babies are you getting them from

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.790 
babies are you getting them from
somebody's<00:00:19.539> umbilical<00:00:20.289> cord<00:00:20.560> or<00:00:20.710> you're

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
somebody's umbilical cord or you're

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.920 
somebody's umbilical cord or you're
getting<00:00:21.009> from<00:00:21.189> somewhere<00:00:21.490> else<00:00:21.579> we<00:00:22.539> use<00:00:22.720> our

into<00:00:38.199> their<00:00:38.350> own<00:00:38.500> bodies<00:00:38.800> it's<00:00:38.980> an<00:00:39.129> autologous

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
into their own bodies it's an autologous

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.000 
into their own bodies it's an autologous
transplant<00:00:40.480> we're<00:00:41.170> taking<00:00:41.320> something<00:00:41.680> from

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
transplant we're taking something from

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.740 
transplant we're taking something from
you<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.489> putting<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.850> back<00:00:43.030> into<00:00:43.360> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 

one<00:00:49.560> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:49.830> efficient<00:00:50.310> ways<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
one of the most efficient ways of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
one of the most efficient ways of
getting<00:00:50.790> stencils<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:51.570> through<00:00:51.780> fat

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
getting stencils is actually through fat

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
getting stencils is actually through fat
tissue<00:00:52.200> for<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.950> less<00:00:53.100> invasive<00:00:53.700> than

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
tissue for one it's less invasive than

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
tissue for one it's less invasive than
getting<00:00:54.060> it<00:00:54.150> from<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:55.080> bone<00:00:55.320> marrow

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
getting it from from bone marrow

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.810 
getting it from from bone marrow
secondly<00:00:56.190> there's<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.460> higher<00:00:56.640> concentration

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
secondly there's a higher concentration

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.570 
secondly there's a higher concentration
in<00:00:57.450> fact<00:00:57.660> issue<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.559> course<00:00:58.860> we<00:00:59.040> can<00:00:59.309> also

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
in fact issue of course we can also

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.400 
in fact issue of course we can also
extract<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.270> bone<00:01:00.510> marrow<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.110> will<00:01:01.260> do

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
extract from bone marrow well we will do

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
extract from bone marrow well we will do
is<00:01:01.650> we'll<00:01:01.800> take<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:02.070> rather<00:01:02.850> large<00:01:03.120> syringe<00:01:03.630> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
is we'll take a rather large syringe and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.930 
is we'll take a rather large syringe and
insert<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.290> into<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> bone<00:01:04.830> extract<00:01:05.729> some<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
insert it into the bone extract some of

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.340 
insert it into the bone extract some of
the<00:01:06.000> marrow<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.600> purify<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.110> sauce

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the marrow and then purify the sauce

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
the marrow and then purify the sauce
from<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.670> basically<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.450> same

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
from there you get basically the same

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.520 
from there you get basically the same
kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> stem<00:01:10.590> cells<00:01:10.830> these<00:01:11.010> are<00:01:12.200> these<00:01:13.200> cells

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
kind of stem cells these are these cells

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.290 
kind of stem cells these are these cells
are<00:01:13.650> non<00:01:13.860> differentiated<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.940> nestled

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
are non differentiated we have nestled

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.730 
are non differentiated we have nestled
markers<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.229> turn<00:01:16.680> into

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
markers so they can actually turn into

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910 
markers so they can actually turn into
any<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> tissue<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.770> can

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
any kind of tissue that we like you can

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
any kind of tissue that we like you can
get<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> said<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:21.270> hip<00:01:21.990> bone<00:01:22.229> for

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
get them like I said from hip bone for

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.660 
get them like I said from hip bone for
example<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.130> from<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.550> were

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
example you can go from if he were

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
example you can go from if he were
usually<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.119> into<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> hip<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.890> extract

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
usually will go into the hip to extract

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
usually will go into the hip to extract
the<00:01:25.979> bone<00:01:26.160> marrow<00:01:26.360> as<00:01:27.360> far<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> adipose

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the bone marrow as far as the adipose

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
the bone marrow as far as the adipose
tissue<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.890> simple<00:01:29.580> matter<00:01:29.940> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
tissue well it's simple matter just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.109 
tissue well it's simple matter just
finding<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.660> fat<00:01:30.869> pouch<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
finding a little fat pouch and

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.380 
finding a little fat pouch and
extracting

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.749 

we're<00:01:38.390> actually<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.840> only<00:01:39.049> group<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:39.759> at

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
we're actually the only group that at

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.240 
we're actually the only group that at
the<00:01:40.909> moment<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.479> doing<00:01:42.049> placement<00:01:43.040> through

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the moment is doing placement through

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.180 
the moment is doing placement through
the<00:01:43.369> arterial<00:01:44.030> system<00:01:44.740> we're<00:01:45.740> using<00:01:45.920> an

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
the arterial system we're using an

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.490 
the arterial system we're using an
endovascular<00:01:46.880> approach<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.810> actually<00:01:48.320> get

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
endovascular approach to actually get

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.139 
endovascular approach to actually get
ourselves<00:01:48.590> closer<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.280> target<00:01:49.490> organ<00:01:49.970> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
ourselves closer to the target organ and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.240 
ourselves closer to the target organ and
that's<00:01:50.960> basically<00:01:51.380> something<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.009> no<00:01:52.159> one

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
that's basically something that no one

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.380 
that's basically something that no one
else<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:52.430> doing

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 

you
