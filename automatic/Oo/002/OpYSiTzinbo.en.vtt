00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
course on aviation and the environment
covers<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:35.320> main<00:00:35.620> three<00:00:35.980> topics<00:00:37.110> confronted

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
covers the main three topics confronted

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420 
covers the main three topics confronted
the<00:00:39.160> equation<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:40.110> aviation<00:00:41.110> contribution<00:00:42.070> to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
the equation is aviation contribution to

three<00:00:52.270> topics<00:00:52.600> are<00:00:52.990> addressed<00:00:53.950> not<00:00:54.670> only<00:00:54.910> in

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
three topics are addressed not only in

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.860 
three topics are addressed not only in
technical<00:00:56.140> terms<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:57.430> operational<00:00:58.030> terms<00:00:58.450> but

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
technical terms of operational terms but

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.410 
technical terms of operational terms but
also<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.410> let's<00:01:00.010> see<00:01:00.220> policy<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:00.940> political

address<00:01:10.180> today<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:11.530> important<00:01:12.009> part<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
address today an important part of the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.920 
address today an important part of the
course<00:01:12.759> is<00:01:13.110> dedicated<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:15.300> communication<00:01:16.300> how

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
course is dedicated to communication how

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.790 
course is dedicated to communication how
as<00:01:17.320> an<00:01:17.860> industry<00:01:18.130> should<00:01:18.970> we<00:01:19.270> communicate

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.110 

what<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.610> unique<00:01:25.180> with<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:25.510> course<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.140> think

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
what is unique with this course I think

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.970 
what is unique with this course I think
it's<00:01:28.120> related<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.870> fact<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.680> covers

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
it's related to the fact that it covers

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.450 
it's related to the fact that it covers
all<00:01:30.550> facets<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.840> problem<00:01:32.340> from<00:01:33.340> an

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
all facets of the problem from an

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.200 
all facets of the problem from an
airline<00:01:34.020> airport<00:01:35.400> manufacturer<00:01:36.400> point<00:01:37.030> of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
airline airport manufacturer point of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.110 
airline airport manufacturer point of
view<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:37.450> also<00:01:37.860> having<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:38.950> mind<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.430> whole

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
view but also having in mind the whole

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.870 
view but also having in mind the whole
of<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.810> air<00:01:41.020> navigation<00:01:41.250> service<00:01:42.250> providers

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
of the air navigation service providers

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.730 
of the air navigation service providers
so<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.820> global<00:01:45.820> approach<00:01:46.440> for<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.470> global

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
so it's a global approach for a global

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.450 
so it's a global approach for a global
problem<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.720> not<00:01:49.900> limited<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.860> let's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
problem and it is not limited to let's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.240 
problem and it is not limited to let's
say<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.120> aspect<00:01:52.870> of<00:01:53.170> environment<00:01:54.010> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
say the aspect of environment and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.560 
say the aspect of environment and
leading<00:01:54.670> airlines<00:01:55.770> participants<00:01:56.940> will<00:01:57.940> bring

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
leading airlines participants will bring

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.710 
leading airlines participants will bring
back<00:01:59.140> home<00:01:59.380> not<00:02:00.100> only<00:02:00.420> much<00:02:01.420> better

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
back home not only much better

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.510 
back home not only much better
understanding<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.560> knowledge<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:03.190> the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
understanding and knowledge of the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
understanding and knowledge of the
problems<00:02:03.910> but<00:02:04.810> also<00:02:05.290> some<00:02:05.910> specific<00:02:06.910> skills

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
problems but also some specific skills

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.670 
problems but also some specific skills
