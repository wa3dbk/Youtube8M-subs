hello there I'm like y'all doing anyways
as<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:03.990> can<00:00:04.140> see<00:00:04.430> starting<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.490> fire<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.029> I'm

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
as you can see starting a fire and I'm

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.100 
as you can see starting a fire and I'm
going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.440> attempt<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.620> cook<00:00:07.980> some<00:00:08.940> Irish<00:00:09.840> beef

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110

stew<00:00:10.620> over<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> fire<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> figured<00:00:12.570> I'd

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
stew over the fire so I figured I'd

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.460 
stew over the fire so I figured I'd
document<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> whole<00:00:13.590> process<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:15.470> if

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
document the whole process and if

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.930 
document the whole process and if
anything<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.190> how<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> make

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

something<00:00:59.440> like<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.850> probably<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.880> little

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
something like that probably a little

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.249 
something like that probably a little
more<00:01:01.180> than<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:04.089> said<00:01:04.449> minced<00:01:04.989> I

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
more than that it's a it said minced I

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.740 
more than that it's a it said minced I
did<00:01:05.800> sliced<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.460> then<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.700> had<00:01:06.850> some<00:01:07.090> internal

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
did sliced and then we had some internal

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.999 
did sliced and then we had some internal
debate<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:09.430> kind<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.700> did<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.880> job<00:01:11.009> about

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
debate so we kind of did a job about

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.400 
debate so we kind of did a job about
that<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.009> that's<00:01:18.100> just<00:01:18.250> going<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.520> cook<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:18.880> a

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
that and that's just going to cook for a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.650 
that and that's just going to cook for a
minute<00:01:20.410> just<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.649> soften<00:01:20.950> up<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:22.420> we'll<00:01:22.539> add

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
minute just to soften up then we'll add

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.950

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
in a pile so I grabbed those and made a

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.930 
in a pile so I grabbed those and made a
ring<00:05:36.720> out<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.790> incidentally<00:05:38.790> which

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
ring out of it and incidentally which

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.300 
ring out of it and incidentally which
worked<00:05:39.180> out<00:05:39.300> great<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:40.140> have<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.740> grill<00:05:41.040> on<00:05:41.220> it

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
couple inches on either side to kind of

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.780 
couple inches on either side to kind of
hold<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> in<00:05:54.240> place<00:05:54.419> for<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.980> uprights<00:05:56.370> it's

welded<00:05:59.310> onto<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.730> and<00:05:59.910> then<00:06:00.540> another<00:06:00.630> piece<00:06:00.960> of

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
welded onto it and then another piece of

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.290 
welded onto it and then another piece of
rebar<00:06:01.290> across<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:02.100> I<00:06:02.160> can<00:06:02.370> hang<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.669> pipe<00:06:02.850> or

rebar across that I can hang the pipe or
the<00:06:03.330> pot<00:06:03.930> from<00:06:04.260> so<00:06:05.419> you<00:06:06.419> know<00:06:06.540> I<00:06:06.570> don't<00:06:06.840> know

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
the pot from so you know I don't know

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.450 
the pot from so you know I don't know
how<00:06:07.080> much<00:06:07.200> those<00:06:07.410> bricks<00:06:07.680> really<00:06:07.980> cost<00:06:08.220> I

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
how much those bricks really cost I

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.950 
how much those bricks really cost I
wouldn't<00:06:08.880> imagine<00:06:09.000> they're<00:06:09.270> very<00:06:09.419> expensive

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
wouldn't imagine they're very expensive

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.159 
wouldn't imagine they're very expensive
but<00:06:10.830> for<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.640> pretty<00:06:12.200> simple<00:06:13.200> design<00:06:13.590> it<00:06:14.190> works

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
but for a pretty simple design it works

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.780 
but for a pretty simple design it works
shockingly<00:06:16.169> well<00:06:16.440> or<00:06:16.710> put<00:06:16.890> another<00:06:16.979> way<00:06:17.190> for

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
shockingly well or put another way for

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.330 
shockingly well or put another way for
as<00:06:17.940> much<00:06:18.390> as<00:06:18.450> I<00:06:18.690> just<00:06:19.350> be<00:06:19.560> asked<00:06:19.860> it<00:06:19.950> as<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.190> went

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
as much as I just be asked it as I went

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.760 
as much as I just be asked it as I went
and<00:06:21.030> we've<00:06:21.540> worked<00:06:21.780> out<00:06:21.960> surprisingly<00:06:22.169> good

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
and we've worked out surprisingly good

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.580 
and we've worked out surprisingly good
so<00:06:23.640> I'm<00:06:24.240> gonna<00:06:24.360> go<00:06:24.479> steer<00:06:24.720> my<00:06:24.900> potatoes<00:06:25.440> and

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
carrots there but I just thought I'd

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.170 
carrots there but I just thought I'd
point<00:06:27.810> out<00:06:27.930> kind<00:06:28.200> of<00:06:28.229> the<00:06:28.350> finer<00:06:29.040> points<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.490> my

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 
no chopping and stuff but it worked out

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.520 
no chopping and stuff but it worked out
pretty<00:07:34.120> good<00:07:34.270> and<00:07:34.750> the<00:07:34.930> way<00:07:35.050> you<00:07:35.110> cook<00:07:35.380> the

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530 
pretty good and the way you cook the

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.080 
pretty good and the way you cook the
stuff<00:07:35.770> with<00:07:36.100> having<00:07:36.430> to<00:07:36.520> brown<00:07:36.730> things

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
stuff with having to brown things

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.210 
stuff with having to brown things
everything<00:07:37.630> works<00:07:38.290> out<00:07:38.470> nice<00:07:38.680> over<00:07:38.920> the<00:07:39.010> fire

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
everything works out nice over the fire

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.800 
everything works out nice over the fire
because<00:07:39.550> the<00:07:39.790> fires<00:07:40.000> are<00:07:40.180> going<00:07:40.480> pretty<00:07:40.570> good

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
because the fires are going pretty good

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.510 
because the fires are going pretty good
at<00:07:40.930> that<00:07:41.080> point<00:07:41.320> and<00:07:41.470> then<00:07:41.560> when<00:07:42.400> you're

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
at that point and then when you're

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.700 
at that point and then when you're
simmering<00:07:42.910> in<00:07:43.030> here<00:07:43.270> it<00:07:43.360> dies<00:07:43.540> down<00:07:43.780> pretty

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
simmering in here it dies down pretty

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.010 
simmering in here it dies down pretty
