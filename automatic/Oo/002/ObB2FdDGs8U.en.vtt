we've done about 145
and<00:00:13.639> having<00:00:14.480> a<00:00:14.540> nice<00:00:14.690> climb<00:00:15.050> right<00:00:15.430> might<00:00:16.430> be<00:00:16.460> a

this<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.650> very<00:00:36.860> sloppy<00:00:37.280> way<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:37.880> starting

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
this is a very sloppy way of starting

this is a very sloppy way of starting

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
this this autopilot

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.490 
this this autopilot
really<00:00:40.120> want<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.360> make<00:00:40.480> sure<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.840> aircraft<00:00:41.020> is

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
really want to make sure the aircraft is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.220 
really want to make sure the aircraft is
trimmed<00:00:41.800> down

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
trimmed down

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.560 
trimmed down
I'm<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.010> telling<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.790> raise<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> nose

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.960 

it<00:00:50.050> has<00:00:50.410> a

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.270 

these<00:00:54.300> lights<00:00:54.600> blink<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.260> control<00:00:55.680> service<00:00:56.130> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
these lights blink my control service is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.750 
these lights blink my control service is
not<00:00:56.490> where<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.790> autopilot<00:00:57.240> wants<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> be

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
not where the autopilot wants it to be

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
not where the autopilot wants it to be
if<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.270> aircraft<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.840> properly<00:01:00.410> trimmed<00:01:00.649> out

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
if the aircraft was properly trimmed out

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.650 
if the aircraft was properly trimmed out
when<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.130> started<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> autopilot<00:01:02.059> all<00:01:02.480> of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
when I started the autopilot all of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
when I started the autopilot all of
these<00:01:02.780> lights<00:01:03.050> would<00:01:03.290> have<00:01:03.440> been<00:01:03.590> like

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
these lights would have been like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.300 
these lights would have been like
and<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.180> autopilot<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.650> electronically

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
and the autopilot is also electronically

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.300 
and the autopilot is also electronically
that's<00:01:10.549> why<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.820> new<00:01:11.420> life

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
that's why the new life

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.399 
that's why the new life
very<00:01:12.940> important

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.370 

we<00:01:18.799> seem<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.130> be

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
we seem to be

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.590 
we seem to be
or<00:01:20.770> until<00:01:21.010> we're<00:01:21.400> doing<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.640> nice<00:01:21.820> fast<00:01:22.180> climb

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
or until we're doing a nice fast climb

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.030 
or until we're doing a nice fast climb
which<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.049> fine

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.860 

by<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.580> way<00:01:31.730> we<00:01:31.910> still<00:01:32.150> have<00:01:32.300> her<00:01:32.390> aid<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:32.690> heal

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
by the way we still have her aid to heal

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.960 
by the way we still have her aid to heal
on<00:01:33.050> we'll<00:01:33.860> just<00:01:33.890> tell<00:01:34.190> her<00:01:34.280> waist<00:01:34.490> gunner<00:01:34.790> to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
on we'll just tell her waist gunner to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.020 
on we'll just tell her waist gunner to
turn<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.330> off<00:01:35.680> in<00:01:36.680> her<00:01:36.950> right<00:01:37.550> he's<00:01:37.730> gonna<00:01:37.850> go

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
turn that off in her right he's gonna go

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.399 
turn that off in her right he's gonna go
on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> back<00:01:38.360> now<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.020> turn<00:01:39.230> it<00:01:39.380> off

through<00:03:04.740> filters<00:03:05.510> which<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.660> hopefully

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
through filters which are hopefully

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.040 
through filters which are hopefully
clean<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.580> get<00:03:08.730> higher<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.270> altitude<00:03:09.420> it's

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
clean as we get higher in altitude it's

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.780 
clean as we get higher in altitude it's
important<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.800> turn<00:03:11.010> our<00:03:11.160> air<00:03:11.310> filters

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
important that we turn our air filters

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.660 
important that we turn our air filters
off<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.960> ram<00:03:13.290> air<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:14.070> when<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.460> turn

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
off and go to ram air now when we turn

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.880 
off and go to ram air now when we turn
these<00:03:14.880> filters<00:03:15.300> off<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.960> ram<00:03:16.170> air<00:03:16.200> doors<00:03:16.740> are

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
these filters off the ram air doors are

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.410 
these filters off the ram air doors are
going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> open<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.610> these<00:03:17.760> amber<00:03:18.210> lights

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
going to open and these amber lights

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.720 
going to open and these amber lights
will<00:03:18.630> become<00:03:18.960> green<00:03:19.260> which<00:03:20.130> means<00:03:20.160> we'll<00:03:20.610> be

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
will become green which means we'll be

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
will become green which means we'll be
pulling<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.270> ram<00:03:21.630> air<00:03:21.990> right<00:03:22.650> from<00:03:22.800> those

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
pulling in ram air right from those

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.590 
pulling in ram air right from those
intakes<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.790> leading<00:03:23.970> edge<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.420> wing

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
intakes in the leading edge of the wing

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.460 
intakes in the leading edge of the wing
that's<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.920> ram<00:03:26.190> air<00:03:26.520> induction<00:03:27.230> but<00:03:28.230> right

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that's the ram air induction but right

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590 
that's the ram air induction but right
now<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.710> filters<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.610> which<00:03:30.090> means<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
now the filters are on which means that

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.050 
now the filters are on which means that
air<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.990> being<00:03:31.200> pulled<00:03:31.560> from<00:03:31.770> inside<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.880> wing

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
air is being pulled from inside the wing

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.960 
air is being pulled from inside the wing
now<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.050> important<00:03:34.710> because<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.550> exhaust

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
now that's important because the exhaust

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.590 
now that's important because the exhaust
is<00:03:36.240> also<00:03:36.840> coming<00:03:37.290> from<00:03:37.320> inside<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.220> wing

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
is also coming from inside the wing

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.510 
is also coming from inside the wing
here<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.440> see<00:03:40.740> those<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:40.980> vents<00:03:41.400> on

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
here you go see those little vents on

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.270 
here you go see those little vents on
the<00:03:41.550> top<00:03:41.960> those<00:03:42.960> are<00:03:42.990> venting<00:03:43.890> out<00:03:44.070> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the top those are venting out the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.520 
the top those are venting out the
exhaust<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.330> air<00:03:45.510> inside<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.110> wing<00:03:46.320> is

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
exhaust so the air inside the wing is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.420 
exhaust so the air inside the wing is
dry<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.790> warmer<00:03:48.950> okay<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.310> we're

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
dry and it's warmer okay so now we're

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.310 
dry and it's warmer okay so now we're
going<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.610> start<00:03:50.850> taking<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.390> colder<00:03:52.020> Ram

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
going to start taking this colder Ram

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.040 
going to start taking this colder Ram
there<00:03:52.680> instead<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.910> warmer<00:03:54.360> filtered<00:03:54.840> air

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
there instead of the warmer filtered air

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.370 
there instead of the warmer filtered air
from<00:03:55.290> inside<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> wing

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
from inside of the wing

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.470 
from inside of the wing
now<00:03:57.890> let's<00:03:58.100> go<00:03:58.310> into<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.610> cockpit<00:03:58.790> where<00:03:59.390> we

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
now let's go into the cockpit where we

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.970 
now let's go into the cockpit where we
can<00:03:59.630> see<00:03:59.900> all<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.350> stuff<00:04:00.620> happening

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
can see all the stuff happening

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.740 
can see all the stuff happening
okay<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:02.640> what<00:04:02.940> I've<00:04:03.030> done<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.270> take<00:04:03.599> this

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
okay so what I've done is take this

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.449 
okay so what I've done is take this
carburetor<00:04:04.170> here<00:04:04.500> temperature<00:04:04.980> gauge<00:04:05.190> and

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
carburetor here temperature gauge and

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.000 
carburetor here temperature gauge and
blow<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.760> up<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.150> can<00:04:06.300> see<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.690> showing<00:04:07.440> 28

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
blow it up so you can see it showing 28

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.770 
blow it up so you can see it showing 28
and<00:04:08.280> 24<00:04:08.910> degrees

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and 24 degrees

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.680 
and 24 degrees
right<00:04:11.380> now<00:04:11.770> we're<00:04:11.950> switching<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.430> ramen

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
right now we're switching to ramen

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.470 
right now we're switching to ramen
the<00:04:14.050> doors<00:04:14.320> are<00:04:14.530> now<00:04:14.650> slowly<00:04:15.040> closing<00:04:15.880> and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
the doors are now slowly closing and

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.290 
the doors are now slowly closing and
slowly<00:04:16.900> taking<00:04:17.680> in<00:04:17.860> the<00:04:18.520> RAM<00:04:18.760> air<00:04:19.030> from<00:04:19.180> the

have<00:04:59.740> not<00:04:59.950> been<00:05:00.130> calibrated<00:05:00.990> typically

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
have not been calibrated typically

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.720 
have not been calibrated typically
you'll<00:05:02.170> do<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.530> once<00:05:02.860> after<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.490> get<00:05:03.700> a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
you'll do this once after you get a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.780 
you'll do this once after you get a
newly<00:05:04.090> rebuilt<00:05:04.450> engine<00:05:05.020> or<00:05:05.260> turbocharger<00:05:06.100> and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
newly rebuilt engine or turbocharger and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.340 
newly rebuilt engine or turbocharger and
you<00:05:06.910> would<00:05:07.000> perform<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.480> calibration<00:05:07.870> on

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
you would perform this calibration on

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.770 
you would perform this calibration on
the<00:05:08.560> runway<00:05:08.860> we<00:05:09.760> did<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.360> I'm<00:05:10.450> going<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.660> do

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
the runway we did so I'm going to do

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.210 
the runway we did so I'm going to do
something<00:05:11.170> you're<00:05:11.260> not<00:05:11.350> supposed<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.890> do<00:05:12.040> and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
something you're not supposed to do and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.420 
something you're not supposed to do and
I'm<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.430> calibrate<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:13.030> turbos

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
I'm going to calibrate the turbos

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.420 
I'm going to calibrate the turbos
inflight<00:05:16.139> okay<00:05:17.139> this<00:05:17.740> is<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.040> is<00:05:18.190> what<00:05:18.310> we

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
inflight okay this is this is what we

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.490 
inflight okay this is this is what we
have<00:05:18.580> here<00:05:18.790> this<00:05:19.570> is<00:05:19.720> our<00:05:19.840> manifold<00:05:20.199> pressure

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
have here this is our manifold pressure

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.370 
have here this is our manifold pressure
select<00:05:20.919> these<00:05:21.880> are<00:05:22.090> turbo<00:05:22.449> trimpots

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.110 

screws<00:05:25.620> in<00:05:25.800> there<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.550> turn<00:05:26.730> them<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.030> the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
screws in there and you turn them to the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.700 
screws in there and you turn them to the
right<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.570> increases<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.170> power<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.620> that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
right and increases the power to that

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.340 
right and increases the power to that
particular<00:05:29.160> turbo<00:05:29.520> basically<00:05:30.480> calibrating

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
particular turbo basically calibrating

and<00:05:31.440> trimming<00:05:31.800> your<00:05:32.160> own<00:05:32.340> turbo<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:33.920> you're

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
and trimming your own turbo so you're

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.880 
and trimming your own turbo so you're
supposed<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.340> turn<00:05:35.520> tune<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.360> turbos<00:05:36.750> at<00:05:37.140> at<00:05:37.680> 8

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
supposed to turn tune the turbos at at 8

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.950 
supposed to turn tune the turbos at at 8
and<00:05:38.160> full<00:05:38.310> power<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.390> since<00:05:39.720> we're<00:05:39.870> moving

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
and full power and since we're moving

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.020 
and full power and since we're moving
along<00:05:40.320> pretty<00:05:40.350> well<00:05:40.650> or<00:05:41.100> summer<00:05:41.370> temperatures

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
along pretty well or summer temperatures

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.180 
along pretty well or summer temperatures
are<00:05:42.150> ok<00:05:42.450> we<00:05:43.200> should<00:05:43.350> be<00:05:43.500> alright<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:43.920> we<00:05:44.040> have

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
are ok we should be alright but we have

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.720 
are ok we should be alright but we have
to<00:05:44.310> do<00:05:44.400> this<00:05:44.550> quick

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
to do this quick

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.050 
to do this quick
so<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.770> am<00:05:47.770> going<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.190> give<00:05:48.340> us<00:05:48.490> full<00:05:48.700> turbo

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
so I am going to give us full turbo

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.050 
so I am going to give us full turbo
power<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:50.290> I'm<00:05:50.770> going<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.100> turn<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.610> pods<00:05:51.820> and

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
power and I'm going to turn the pods and

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.000 
power and I'm going to turn the pods and
we're<00:05:52.210> going<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.360> make<00:05:52.540> all<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:52.990> these<00:05:53.380> sub

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
we're going to make all of these sub

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.050 
we're going to make all of these sub
manifold<00:05:54.850> pressure<00:05:55.150> readings<00:05:56.140> be<00:05:56.560> exactly<00:05:57.250> 46

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
manifold pressure readings be exactly 46

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.940 
manifold pressure readings be exactly 46
cuz<00:05:58.420> that's<00:05:58.690> what<00:05:58.990> it's<00:05:59.110> supposed<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.530> be<00:05:59.740> with

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
cuz that's what it's supposed to be with

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.640 
cuz that's what it's supposed to be with
the<00:06:00.040> rent

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
the rent

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.860 
the rent
oh<00:06:00.680> here<00:06:01.160> we<00:06:01.190> go

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.660 

all<00:06:09.230> right<00:06:09.470> so<00:06:09.800> we<00:06:09.890> see<00:06:10.100> our<00:06:10.280> number<00:06:10.520> one

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
all right so we see our number one

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.220 
all right so we see our number one
inches<00:06:11.000> little<00:06:11.270> high<00:06:11.390> and<00:06:11.450> a<00:06:11.720> full<00:06:11.750> this<00:06:12.050> thing

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
inches little high and a full this thing

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.310 
inches little high and a full this thing
back<00:06:12.410> here

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.440 

I'm<00:06:17.500> just<00:06:17.710> putting<00:06:18.010> my<00:06:18.100> mouse<00:06:18.310> over<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:19.210> trim

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
I'm just putting my mouse over the trim

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.620 
I'm just putting my mouse over the trim
pot<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:19.990> moving

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
pot and moving

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:30.090 
pot and moving
our<00:06:22.110> number<00:06:22.710> four<00:06:22.920> engines<00:06:23.340> of<00:06:23.490> little

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.839 

three<00:06:30.700> one<00:06:30.940> clicking<00:06:31.390> in<00:06:31.540> a<00:06:31.600> back

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.399 

those<00:06:36.999> are

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.619 

pretty<00:06:40.800> good<00:06:40.949> okay<00:06:41.639> so<00:06:41.699> I<00:06:41.879> want<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.360> pull<00:06:42.539> this

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
pretty good okay so I want to pull this

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:43.939 
pretty good okay so I want to pull this
back<00:06:42.869> we<00:06:43.050> don't<00:06:43.139> want<00:06:43.319> to<00:06:43.379> get<00:06:43.469> run<00:06:43.619> again<00:06:43.830> this

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
back we don't want to get run again this

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.540 
back we don't want to get run again this
full<00:06:44.189> power<00:06:44.399> for<00:06:44.639> too<00:06:44.759> long

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
full power for too long

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.710 
full power for too long
pull<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:45.910> back

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.730 

there<00:06:49.140> we<00:06:49.350> go<00:06:49.500> that's<00:06:49.740> sort<00:06:49.950> of<00:06:50.010> a<00:06:50.100> maximum
