00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.590
 This is very faithful 850 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.940
 you need the business wheel here are missing 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.280
 a couple of details I do not finish in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.610
 these days 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.740
 this is the super beast that inside 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 there are quite a few things left in the one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 work that we lack inside 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.560
 I have here we have 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 the car with the paint stains that 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.800
 you know with water and soap ladies 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.429
 he lacks in the law he said give me 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.429
 after 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.150
 the little engine is all right it's almost said 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.310
 all new 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.370
 pretty good to go to augur and come 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.220
 ample 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.030
 a car like a thread 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.030
 let's learn how not 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 we sit 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.080
 for our 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.980
 and all soft 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980
 and she surrounds me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.920
 long 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.840
 how I have bits 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 and if the auditor 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.140
 and I ask for 45 because I think that the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 vouchers tells you almost all the new engine 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.100
 all this and now yes with this from the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.970
 wheel as I warned you are missing a couple of 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.040
 nothing else 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.100
 Brakes have missing hand brake 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.260
 then it's all rather 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.250
 and a car to start with was pretty 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.090
 well I loved what I enjoyed and good 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.050
 now I want to change for something more 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
 big but 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.860
 to nobody 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 once for 90 days 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.290
 like the soft 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.970
 and good now how is good is not the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.210

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.210

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:12.430

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.760
 It's so new 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.370
 two thousand pesos to the purchase of three days 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.370

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.050
