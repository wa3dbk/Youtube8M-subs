00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 sad is a real freezer is 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.960
 the bench of the Mexican team 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 there's a lot of nerve there's tension between 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.930
 weeks left before the game 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.420
 the party is over 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.940
 oh no good still we get the luxury 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.100
 tendency to keep the cabal from 2 to 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.600
 0 is not a small thing because a while it's going to 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.890
 be adding goals in favor and 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 goals against is not a small thing 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.800
 It is the Christian Chaco 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.930
 chaco gimÃ©nez happens to be indebted the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 press people are trying to get bottom that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.050
 give the face as well as the good what is 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.630
 the problem was not damaged, it was not damaged 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 recognize not harmed accept and that comes 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.650
 the gimÃ©nez chaco seeks to recognize and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.380
 there is shame if you are ashamed and not 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.970
 they have the bad or on the contrary bad it would be 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.010
 not feel embarrassed in a 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.329
 moment like these 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.119
 so hopefully you take a plan of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.580
 crisis at this time and if we are going to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.530
 get to train and work with three 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 days before against panama will not pull 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.729
 this matter let's concentrate 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.500
 for a month we take measures 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.619
 extraordinary for a situation 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 criticism let's bring someone who knows 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.090
 this matter that can solve this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.240
 just ask those who have already passed through there 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 that in a call marquez to claudio to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 those who have already passed by this this is 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 so clear bring someone to lift 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 killed someone who plays for the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.780
 descent we are to follow it we are 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.990
 going to the second we are descending 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.350
 or we play the next two games as 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.229
 if we were small team to point here to 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.010
 edge of the decline or not even against 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.930
 new zealand we travel in the name of inÃ©s 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.510
 to line up the warrior 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.970
 Antonio Rosique of the immortal field I am 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.500
 martin o'neill thank you very much to see what 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.520
 happens with the selection 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520
 we are devastated
