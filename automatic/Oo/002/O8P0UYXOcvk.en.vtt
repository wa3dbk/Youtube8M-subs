Battle City duel disk model or should I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
say the 1996 duel disk model what I like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
say the 1996 duel disk model what I like
about<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.270> most<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.170> 10<00:00:37.469> times

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
about this the most is that it 10 times

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.030 
about this the most is that it 10 times
lighter<00:00:38.100> than<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.670> GX<00:00:39.149> disk<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.559> only<00:00:40.860> bad

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
lighter than the GX disk the only bad

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.299 
lighter than the GX disk the only bad
thing<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.520> hate<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
thing I hate about this is that the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
thing I hate about this is that the
magic<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> trap<00:00:44.610> card<00:00:45.030> zone<00:00:45.090> slots<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:46.079> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
magic and trap card zone slots are in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.279 
magic and trap card zone slots are in
the<00:00:46.500> Front's<00:00:47.010> other<00:00:47.789> rather<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> side

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the Front's other rather than the side

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.100 
the Front's other rather than the side
and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:50.670> bad<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and the only bad thing about that is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
and the only bad thing about that is
that<00:00:52.340> say<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:53.820> setting<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that say if you're setting that's a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.709 
that say if you're setting that's a
magic<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.680> trap<00:00:55.739> card<00:00:56.449> somebody<00:00:57.449> might<00:00:57.660> be

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
magic or trap card somebody might be

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
magic or trap card somebody might be
able<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> tilt<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
able to see if you tilt it up a little

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.439 
able to see if you tilt it up a little
bit<00:00:59.960> yeah<00:01:01.340> plus<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.730> bad<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bit yeah plus the other bad thing is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.969 
bit yeah plus the other bad thing is
that<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.450> GX<00:01:06.450> dis<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.200> hold<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.860> bit

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that the GX dis can hold a little bit

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.480 
that the GX dis can hold a little bit
more<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.000> Scott<00:01:09.570> big<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:11.130> card

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
more because it Scott big can use card

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
more because it Scott big can use card
sleeves<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.350> makes<00:01:13.650> your

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
sleeves but this doesn't so makes your

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
sleeves but this doesn't so makes your
deck<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> little<00:01:14.460> bit<00:01:14.820> under<00:01:15.600> pressure<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
deck a little bit under pressure and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
deck a little bit under pressure and
compact<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.150> makes<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> hard<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> pull<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
compact and it makes it hard to pull up

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.440 
compact and it makes it hard to pull up
your<00:01:19.470> cards<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> let's<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.320> further<00:01:22.680> ado

these<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> COS<00:02:00.030> owns<00:02:00.270> bend<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
these that the COS owns bend your the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.249 
these that the COS owns bend your the
corners<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.100> cards<00:02:02.640> sort<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.540> one

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
corners if you cards sort of like one

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.350 
corners if you cards sort of like one
lot<00:02:04.470> sort<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.550> card<00:02:05.880> destruction

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
lot sort of like this card destruction

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.100 
lot sort of like this card destruction
card<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.090> corners<00:02:09.959> are

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
card here as you can see the corners are

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
card here as you can see the corners are
a<00:02:10.170> bit<00:02:10.350> bent<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> duel

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
a bit bent I think it's from the duel

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.970 
a bit bent I think it's from the duel
disk<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.660> maybe<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.830> I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
disk or maybe it's just like that I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.050 
disk or maybe it's just like that I
really<00:02:14.580> don't<00:02:14.850> know<00:02:15.030> or<00:02:15.540> give<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> yeah

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
really don't know or give a so yeah
