00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.310
 whistle 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.750
 this is a railway network with a lot 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.570
 activity equal to that of everything 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.730
 all day the locomotives travel the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.670
 pathways from top to bottom leading to 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.100
 passengers where they want to go 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.050
 in the railway networks there is a lot 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.570
 movement and have many noises 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.279
 different but a sound always 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.000
 will say that you are near a network of 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.000
 steam locomotives 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.150
 and you know what sound is that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 exact that of the whistles 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.860
 the locomotives play their whistles all 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.460
 the day to tell everyone that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.460
 they are close 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.399
 this is very important let's see why 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.800
 this locomotive is going up by a 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 steep hill 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.649
 as the locomotive leaks the driver 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.840
 touch the whistle to warn everyone 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.229
 world at the top that the locomotive goes on 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.229
 path 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 when the locomotive advances by a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 pronounced curve another whistle 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.610
 driver notifies people who 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 they are near you will soon see a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.770
 imposing locomotive around the corner 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770
 corner 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.990
 the whistle is very important at the crossing 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.090
 of cars 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.810
 the crossing of cars is where the tracks 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 they cross the street 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.130
 the manager knows that the locomotive 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.229
 about but the driver of the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.369
 locomotive touches the whistle to also 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.369
 notify the cars 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.310
 sometimes the whistle is heard in the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 station 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.660
 the driver of the locomotive makes a 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.970
 small whistle before reaching the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.490
 station to notify passengers 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.270
 that the train is very close and that soon 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.270
 can they address 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.280
 and the driver is again a small 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 whistle as the train pulls away as 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.410
 saying goodbye 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.850
 sometimes a horn is heard instead of 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.850
 a whistle 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 who think he made that sound 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.040
 exact a diesel locomotive the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 diesel locomotives do not have whistles 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.050
 of steam they have a plan they are like 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.820
 whistles of steam locomotives the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.470
 horn of the bezel locomotives 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.390
 they tell people who are very close 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.460
 the whistle of a steam locomotive 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 it sounds very different to the horn of a 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.750
 diesel locomotive 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.670
 but it has the same function try 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.500
 listening to a whistle or a plan are the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.780
 next time you are near a network 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.470
 railway maybe the greeting is heard 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.470
 of a locomotive
