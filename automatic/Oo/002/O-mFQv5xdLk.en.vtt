I<00:00:59.629> chose<00:01:00.629> Tyrone<00:01:01.199> he's<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I chose Tyrone he's the first one and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.799 
I chose Tyrone he's the first one and
seems<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> make<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.510> pretty<00:01:03.750> much

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
seems to make like pretty much

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:15.590 
seems to make like pretty much
everything<00:01:04.199> he<00:01:04.500> throws<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> basket

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.510 

except<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:19.440> when<00:01:20.440> he<00:01:20.560> made<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.950> one<00:01:21.160> so

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
except for that when he made that one so

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.830 
except for that when he made that one so
that's<00:01:21.580> good

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.660

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
in this and that looked amazed me why I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.780 
in this and that looked amazed me why I
played<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.449> like<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.829> other<00:03:40.949> recordings<00:03:41.609> I

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
played it like in the other recordings I

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.580 
played it like in the other recordings I
made<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.299> from<00:03:42.540> half-filled<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.379> thought

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
made one from half-filled and I thought

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.229 
made one from half-filled and I thought
that<00:03:43.829> was<00:03:44.010> amazing<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.819> never<00:03:44.879> did

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
that was amazing because I never did

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:54.680 
that was amazing because I never did
that<00:03:45.389> before<00:03:45.510> either<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:53.389> yeah<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.419> think

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
that before either but yeah I think

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:26.190 
that before either but yeah I think
we've<00:03:54.810> pretty<00:03:54.959> much<00:03:55.079> won<00:03:55.530> here
