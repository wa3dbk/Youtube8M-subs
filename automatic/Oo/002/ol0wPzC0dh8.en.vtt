earlier<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.450> I'm<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.660> walking<00:02:51.840> around<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
earlier so I'm just walking around and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.759 
earlier so I'm just walking around and
let's<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:53.040> if<00:02:53.070> we<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.640> um<00:02:53.820> kind<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.019> find<00:02:55.650> that

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
let's see if we can um kind of find that

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.470 
let's see if we can um kind of find that
emeral<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:58.280> hear<00:02:59.280> something<00:02:59.640> guys<00:03:00.300> hear

could then use to trade with the
villagers<00:03:41.130> we<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.670> brought<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
villagers we have just brought so as you

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.180 
villagers we have just brought so as you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
can see once they grow to their normal

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.979 
can see once they grow to their normal
size<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.609> can<00:03:44.670> then<00:03:44.880> walk<00:03:45.090> around<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.660> such

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
size they can then walk around and such

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
size they can then walk around and such
so<00:03:46.530> let's<00:03:46.650> go<00:03:46.709> ahead<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.040> steal<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
so let's go ahead and just steal all of

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.490 
so let's go ahead and just steal all of
their<00:03:47.790> noses<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:48.810> we<00:03:49.019> grow<00:03:49.260> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
their noses now and this we grow and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.470 
their noses now and this we grow and
fill<00:03:49.739> amount<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.220> villagers<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:51.269> as<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.390> can

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
fill amount of villagers so as you can

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.880 
fill amount of villagers so as you can
see<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:51.780> they're<00:03:52.140> missing<00:03:52.320> all<00:03:52.530> their<00:03:52.709> noses

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
see now they're missing all their noses

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.229 
see now they're missing all their noses
and<00:03:53.160> we<00:03:53.250> need<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.459> right-click<00:03:53.640> on<00:03:53.880> them<00:03:54.090> now

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
and we need to right-click on them now

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.030 
and we need to right-click on them now
they<00:03:54.420> say<00:03:54.570> leave<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:54.900> alone<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.410> miss<00:03:55.650> my<00:03:55.829> nose

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so basically you can no longer trade

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.810 
so basically you can no longer trade
with<00:03:57.900> them<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.590> now<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.859> eight<00:03:59.040> noses<00:03:59.670> that

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
with them so now I have eight noses that

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.000 
with them so now I have eight noses that
can<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.000> regrow<00:04:00.480> any<00:04:00.720> more<00:04:01.019> villagers<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
can this regrow any more villagers so

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.289 
can this regrow any more villagers so
this<00:04:02.100> basically<00:04:02.459> means<00:04:02.640> could<00:04:02.850> have<00:04:02.940> endless

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
this basically means could have endless

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.900 
this basically means could have endless
amount<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.930> villagers<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.739> your<00:04:05.220> village<00:04:05.700> or

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
of course and they spawn down different

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.120 
of course and they spawn down different
types<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.220> villagers<00:04:12.140> with<00:04:13.140> great<00:04:13.620> succession
