here you two Jack's like this make you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
here you two Jack's like this make you
could<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> pinky<00:01:09.689> brick<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
could do like a pinky brick but I just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
could do like a pinky brick but I just
like<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.710> set<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.460> earlier<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> trick

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
like to set this up earlier in the trick

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.679 
like to set this up earlier in the trick
just<00:01:13.580> situate<00:01:14.580> these<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.630> see

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
just situate these so that you can't see

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
just situate these so that you can't see
the<00:01:15.900> ones<00:01:16.049> behind<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:19.790> hit<00:01:20.790> four

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the ones behind just be like I hit four

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
the ones behind just be like I hit four
jacks<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> cards<00:01:23.759> behind<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
jacks so you have the cards behind the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.160 
jacks so you have the cards behind the
jacks<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:25.229> cards<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:27.049> square<00:01:28.049> them

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
jacks for cards so when you square them

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830 
jacks for cards so when you square them
up<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.920> them<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> deck<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.270> four<00:01:30.509> random

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
up put them on the deck the four random

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
up put them on the deck the four random
cards<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> top<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.420> people<00:01:33.420> will

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
cards will be at the top and people will

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359
