00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that I made on the game to try and keep

that I made on the game to try and keep
the<00:01:07.950> game<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.369> obviously<00:01:08.700> cuz<00:01:08.880> plenty<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the game going obviously cuz plenty of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
the game going obviously cuz plenty of
time<00:01:09.900> real-life<00:01:10.350> play<00:01:10.500> later<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> game

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
time real-life play later in the game

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
time real-life play later in the game
when<00:01:11.400> they're<00:01:11.520> 35<00:01:11.820> years<00:01:12.060> old<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> they

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
when they're 35 years old and they

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.810 
when they're 35 years old and they
retire<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.780> 40<00:01:13.170> years<00:01:13.320> old<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> there's<00:01:14.670> no

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
retire or 40 years old and there's no

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
retire or 40 years old and there's no
other<00:01:15.000> players<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.570> what's<00:01:16.080> gonna<00:01:16.170> happen

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
other players there what's gonna happen

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.600 
other players there what's gonna happen
with<00:01:16.500> full<00:01:16.650> mana<00:01:16.830> obviously<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.430> why<00:01:17.490> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
with full mana obviously that's why they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
with full mana obviously that's why they
make<00:01:17.729> regenerate<00:01:18.270> players<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
make regenerate players and this is the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
make regenerate players and this is the
routine<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> program<00:01:20.520> goes<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.000> it's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
routine that program goes for and it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.219 
routine that program goes for and it's
been<00:01:21.210> laced<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> last<00:01:21.720> few<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.049> those

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
been laced for the last few see those

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
been laced for the last few see those
and<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.500> no<00:01:22.619> different<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.040> season<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.729> days

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and it's no different to season the days

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
and it's no different to season the days
maybe<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.509> two<00:01:24.540> days<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.409> still

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
maybe one or two days off but it's still

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
maybe one or two days off but it's still
the<00:01:25.740> same<00:01:25.920> principle<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the same principle so this is how it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
the same principle so this is how it
works<00:01:27.600> basically<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.159> basically<00:01:29.159> these<00:01:29.310> are

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
works basically so basically these are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
works basically so basically these are
the<00:01:29.460> dates<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.909> come<00:01:30.060> around<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> look

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the dates they come around so you look

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
the dates they come around so you look
for<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> key<00:01:30.810> ones<00:01:31.020> obviously<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.770> example

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
for the key ones obviously for example

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
for the key ones obviously for example
I'm<00:01:32.189> England<00:01:32.759> 13th<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> March<00:01:33.860> Europe<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I'm England 13th of March Europe is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
I'm England 13th of March Europe is
mainly<00:01:35.280> around<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> March<00:01:36.180> period<00:01:36.420> look<00:01:36.960> all

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
mainly around the March period look all

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
mainly around the March period look all
these<00:01:37.560> Europe<00:01:37.860> European<00:01:38.460> teams<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.390> what

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
these Europe European teams so what

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
these Europe European teams so what
happens<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> basically<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.400> gate<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> plays

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
happens is basically the gate the plays

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
happens is basically the gate the plays
are<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> notice<00:01:43.320> your

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
are made and also if you notice your

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.469 
are made and also if you notice your
manager<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> message<00:01:44.850> saying<00:01:45.030> youth

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
manager you get a message saying youth

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
manager you get a message saying youth
team<00:01:45.780> candy<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.439> come<00:01:46.649> through<00:01:46.680> that's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
team candy that's come through that's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700 
team candy that's come through that's
basically<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> trial<00:01:48.270> team<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.470> how

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
basically the trial team and that's how

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
basically the trial team and that's how
you<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:50.280> your<00:01:50.369> youth<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.909> how<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you get your youth that's how the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
you get your youth that's how the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
team after that your system says look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.359 
team after that your system says look
this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> key<00:02:01.380> player<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.159> who<00:02:02.280> we

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
this is the key player this is who we

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.560 
this is the key player this is who we
should<00:02:02.399> sign<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> players<00:02:03.390> I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
going to filter the searches so we have

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.929 
going to filter the searches so we have
to<00:03:11.849> do<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.859> where<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:13.950> go<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.280> can't

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
to do is you go to where you go I can't

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
find it pick attributes notice a so you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.449 
find it pick attributes notice a so you
got<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> condition<00:03:19.949> I<00:03:19.980> don't<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.310> why<00:03:20.370> I'm

a<00:03:46.829> team<00:03:47.010> like<00:03:47.389> Southampton<00:03:48.389> if<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.629> was<00:03:48.750> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
a team like Southampton if I was a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.569 
a team like Southampton if I was a
Southampton<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:49.379> example<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.159> we<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.489> do

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
Southampton for example so we have to do

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.979 
Southampton for example so we have to do
is<00:03:50.699> you<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.970> try<00:03:51.120> filter<00:03:51.510> even<00:03:51.690> further

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
is you have to try filter even further

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.020 
is you have to try filter even further
so<00:03:52.229> what<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.379> gotta<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.769> go<00:03:52.919> and<00:03:53.400> say

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
so what you gotta do is you go and say

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.050 
so what you gotta do is you go and say
for<00:03:54.150> example<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:55.139> go<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.590> condition

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
for example you go to a condition

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.809 
for example you go to a condition
club<00:03:57.870> division<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.709> example<00:03:59.099> you<00:03:59.519> go<00:03:59.760> to

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
club division for example you go to

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.309 
club division for example you go to
maybe<00:04:00.269> league<00:04:00.599> one<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:02.269> England<00:04:03.269> league<00:04:04.079> one

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
maybe league one so England league one

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.199 
maybe league one so England league one
you'd<00:04:05.010> look<00:04:05.190> through<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> players<00:04:05.639> here<00:04:05.940> you
