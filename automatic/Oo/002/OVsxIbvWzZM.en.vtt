00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
together so I want to do the top of the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
together so I want to do the top of the
bus<00:01:59.369> first<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> space

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
bus first and we kind of want to space

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.469 
bus first and we kind of want to space
out<00:02:01.439> where<00:02:02.280> our<00:02:02.399> pictures<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
out where our pictures but are going to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
out where our pictures but are going to
be<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> we'll<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> eyeball<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
make sure that it fits with the top of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
make sure that it fits with the top of
our<00:02:08.429> other<00:02:08.849> popsicle<00:02:09.450> stick<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.170> going

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
our other popsicle stick and we're going

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 
our other popsicle stick and we're going
to<00:02:10.319> use<00:02:10.470> our<00:02:10.590> glue<00:02:10.649> gun<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.069> put<00:02:11.340> these<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.730> two

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to use our glue gun to put these two two

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
to use our glue gun to put these two two
there<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.990> I'm<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.350> gonna<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.740> dab<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.190> glue

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
there so I'm just gonna do a dab of glue

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.700 
there so I'm just gonna do a dab of glue
on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.820> top<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:16.020> three<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.410> these<00:02:18.710> okay

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
on the top of all three of these okay

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.300 
on the top of all three of these okay
and<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.880> line<00:02:21.240> those<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.560> maybe

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and just line those up and just maybe

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640 
and just line those up and just maybe
put<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> end<00:02:23.850> one<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.470> way<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
put the end one on here so that way you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.820 
put the end one on here so that way you
can<00:02:25.890> decide<00:02:26.190> exactly<00:02:26.430> where<00:02:26.880> your<00:02:27.030> Center<00:02:27.390> is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
can decide exactly where your Center is

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.240 
can decide exactly where your Center is
go<00:02:32.150> okay<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.210> now<00:02:33.480> we've<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.500> top<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.100> our

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
go okay so now we've got the top of our

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
go okay so now we've got the top of our
bus<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.480> where<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:36.780> actually

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
bus here and that's where we're actually

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
bus here and that's where we're actually
gonna<00:02:37.110> put<00:02:37.320> our<00:02:37.410> photos<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.850> we're

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
gonna put our photos in and then we're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
going to grab our bigger popsicle sticks

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
going to grab our bigger popsicle sticks
okay<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.560> we're<00:02:43.860> gonna<00:02:43.950> line<00:02:44.430> these<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
okay and we're gonna line these up to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.960 
okay and we're gonna line these up to
make<00:02:45.240> our<00:02:45.360> actual<00:02:45.870> bus<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.100> like<00:02:47.340> mine<00:02:47.670> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
make our actual bus so I like mine to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.820 
make our actual bus so I like mine to
line<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:48.510> exactly<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.100> going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.310> put<00:02:50.520> two

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
line up exactly and I'm going to put two

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.260 
line up exactly and I'm going to put two
one<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> top<00:02:53.220> kind<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.970> center

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
one on the top kind of one in the center

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.360 
one on the top kind of one in the center
and<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> balance<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.070> set

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and then I'm going to balance this set

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.650 
and then I'm going to balance this set
in<00:02:56.520> this<00:02:56.640> third<00:02:56.880> one<00:02:57.320> right<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.470> top<00:02:58.800> there<00:02:59.660> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
in this third one right on top there to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.910 
in this third one right on top there to
give<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.530> little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.800> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
give just kind of a little bit of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.530 
give just kind of a little bit of
dimension<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:03.150> where<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.390> could

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
dimension and that's where you could

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.610 
dimension and that's where you could
write<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.780> name<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.080> school

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
write the name of the school

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.860 
write the name of the school
so<00:03:04.980> let's<00:03:05.220> glue<00:03:05.580> these<00:03:05.820> guys<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.420> same<00:03:06.630> way

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so let's glue these guys on the same way

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.000 
so let's glue these guys on the same way
so<00:03:07.440> I'm<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.330> three<00:03:09.650> dabs<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so I'm just going to do three dabs of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.980 
so I'm just going to do three dabs of
glue<00:03:11.070> here<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.120> want<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.360> leave<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:12.780> bit

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
glue here you want to leave a little bit

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.040 
glue here you want to leave a little bit
of<00:03:13.110> room<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.320> put<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:13.740> tires<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.370> too<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.720> put

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
of room to put your tires on too so put

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:25.750 
of room to put your tires on too so put
that<00:03:16.110> going<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:19.790> same<00:03:20.790> thing<00:03:20.820> up<00:03:21.120> here

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.759 

and<00:03:26.239> I'm<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.540> using<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.930> low<00:03:27.080> temp<00:03:27.349> glue<00:03:27.409> gun

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
and I'm just using a low temp glue gun

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.550 
and I'm just using a low temp glue gun
so<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.489> safe<00:03:28.819> for<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> kids<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.420> use<00:03:29.870> but

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
so that is safe for the kids to use but

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.160 
so that is safe for the kids to use but
you<00:03:30.680> could<00:03:30.830> also<00:03:30.980> use<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:32.060> Elmer's<00:03:32.750> glue<00:03:33.019> or

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
you could also use just Elmer's glue or

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.259 
you could also use just Elmer's glue or
