00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
game so these ones are called the first

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130 
game so these ones are called the first
games<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> someone<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

shoe right here oops 11-5 2003 and that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.120 
shoe right here oops 11-5 2003 and that
is<00:01:50.250> significant<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.930> first<00:01:52.200> game<00:01:52.500> LeBron

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is significant for the first game LeBron

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.870 
is significant for the first game LeBron
had<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.970> an<00:01:54.119> NBA<00:01:54.390> player<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
had as an NBA player so I think and you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
had as an NBA player so I think and you
guys<00:01:57.000> correct<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.630> wrong<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.380> think

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
guys correct me if I'm wrong I think

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
guys correct me if I'm wrong I think
that<00:01:59.310> he<00:01:59.700> didn't<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.090> end<00:02:00.390> up<00:02:00.540> playing

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that he didn't actually end up playing

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.480 
that he didn't actually end up playing
his<00:02:01.259> first<00:02:01.409> game<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:01.890> sneakers<00:02:02.310> though

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
his first game in these sneakers though

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.920 
his first game in these sneakers though
it's<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.790> which<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> ironic<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.719> they

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's just which is ironic that they

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's just which is ironic that they
actually<00:02:04.229> call<00:02:04.409> him<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.920> first<00:02:05.070> games<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.520> he

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
actually call him the first games and he

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.419 
actually call him the first games and he
wasn't<00:02:05.880> even<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> wearing<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.810> ones<00:02:07.079> also

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
wasn't even the wearing these ones also

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
wasn't even the wearing these ones also
i<00:02:08.429> don't<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.000> his<00:02:09.119> first<00:02:09.450> sneaker

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
i don't think it's his first sneaker

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
i don't think it's his first sneaker
ever<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.830> thought<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> LeBron<00:02:11.879> actually<00:02:12.209> had

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
ever i thought that LeBron actually had

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
ever i thought that LeBron actually had
some<00:02:12.480> air<00:02:12.660> force<00:02:12.870> ones<00:02:13.110> or<00:02:13.440> something<00:02:13.709> like

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
some air force ones or something like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.059 
some air force ones or something like
that

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
that

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.339 
that
um<00:02:14.299> before<00:02:15.299> he<00:02:15.510> actually<00:02:15.659> got<00:02:16.049> his<00:02:16.200> own

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
um before he actually got his own

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.770 
um before he actually got his own
signature<00:02:16.799> shoe<00:02:17.159> so<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.299> guys<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.569> correct

carbon fiber between here and then this

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.069 
carbon fiber between here and then this
material<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.489> kind<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.729> weird<00:03:53.909> it's<00:03:54.599> kind<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.959> a

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079
