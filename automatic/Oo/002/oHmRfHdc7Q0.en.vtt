tremendous reduction in weight and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.100 
tremendous reduction in weight and
simple<00:01:01.010> file<00:01:01.190> out<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.610> lines<00:01:01.930> because<00:01:02.930> of

those materials and those techniques

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.820 
those materials and those techniques
which<00:01:04.699> then<00:01:04.909> allowed<00:01:05.210> us<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.600> really<00:01:05.800> tap<00:01:06.800> into

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
which then allowed us to really tap into

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.820 
which then allowed us to really tap into
that<00:01:07.270> old-school<00:01:08.270> aesthetic<00:01:08.870> and<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.470> tribute

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you can see that the apparent is is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.880 
you can see that the apparent is is
blocked<00:01:19.670> pretty<00:01:19.970> simply<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.510> this<00:01:21.470> is<00:01:21.590> how<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
attacked you from abrasions by just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.359 
attacked you from abrasions by just
leathers<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.810> rubbers<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.470> thick<00:01:48.619> corydoras

leathers and rubbers and thick corydoras

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.070 
leathers and rubbers and thick corydoras
but<00:01:49.850> they<00:01:50.090> don't<00:01:50.270> necessarily<00:01:50.390> have<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.930> be

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
but they don't necessarily have to be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.840 
but they don't necessarily have to be
over<00:01:51.380> built<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.010> heavy<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:52.700> what's

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
over built or that heavy so what's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.070 
over built or that heavy so what's
interesting<00:01:53.030> about<00:01:53.360> New<00:01:53.510> Jersey<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:53.930> at<00:01:54.049> a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
interesting about New Jersey is at a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.890 
interesting about New Jersey is at a
very<00:01:54.170> simple<00:01:54.830> Jersey<00:01:55.640> but<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.330> really<00:01:56.600> isn't

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
very simple Jersey but it really isn't
