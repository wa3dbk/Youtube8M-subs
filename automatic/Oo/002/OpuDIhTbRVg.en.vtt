around 6:15 this morning and since we're
still<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.790> should<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.060> safe<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
still here I think we should be safe I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
still here I think we should be safe I
guess<00:01:13.260> I'll<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> grade<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.040> those<00:01:14.220> lab

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

the next exciting chapter miss Kimpton
will<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.800> do<00:03:24.980> me<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.160> honor<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:26.320> marrying<00:03:27.320> me

will you do me the honor of marrying me

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.840 
will you do me the honor of marrying me
so<00:03:29.840> let's<00:03:30.110> switch<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.530> live<00:03:30.709> feed<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
so let's switch the live feed and and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:51.660 
so let's switch the live feed and and
see<00:03:32.060> how<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.180> do

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.850 

looks<00:03:52.670> like<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.880> lost<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.240> live<00:03:53.420> feed<00:03:53.860> well

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
looks like we lost the live feed well

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.980 
looks like we lost the live feed well
even<00:03:55.400> if<00:03:55.460> she<00:03:55.490> says<00:03:55.730> no<00:03:55.760> mr.<00:03:56.450> Herman<00:03:56.750> only<00:03:56.870> had

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
even if she says no mr. Herman only had

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.060 
even if she says no mr. Herman only had
to<00:03:57.050> be<00:03:57.140> embarrassed<00:03:57.500> for<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.680> little<00:03:57.920> while

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
to be embarrassed for a little while

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.340 
to be embarrassed for a little while
because<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.940> world<00:03:59.270> might<00:03:59.420> end<00:03:59.540> today<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.200> as

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
because the world might end today so as

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.110 
because the world might end today so as
long<00:04:00.470> as<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> world<00:04:00.770> does<00:04:00.890> in<00:04:01.220> he's<00:04:01.640> fine

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
long as the world does in he's fine
