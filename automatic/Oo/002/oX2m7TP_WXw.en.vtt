I'm gonna be honest typically I do yoga
in<00:04:50.980> as<00:04:51.310> little<00:04:51.730> clothing<00:04:52.000> as<00:04:52.270> possible<00:04:52.330> just

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
in as little clothing as possible just

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.990 
in as little clothing as possible just
because<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.380> like<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.860> be<00:04:53.980> one<00:04:54.370> with<00:04:54.580> my<00:04:54.760> body

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
because I like to be one with my body

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.490 
because I like to be one with my body
and<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.420> feel<00:04:55.600> like<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.810> kind<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.050> defeats<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
and I feel like it kind of defeats the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.950 
and I feel like it kind of defeats the
purpose<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:57.220> be<00:04:57.760> wearing<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.090> bunch<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.390> crap

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
purpose to be wearing a bunch of crap

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.540 
purpose to be wearing a bunch of crap
but<00:04:59.290> for<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.590> sake<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.950> video<00:05:00.070> I'm

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
but for the sake of the video I'm

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.910 
but for the sake of the video I'm
wearing<00:05:01.360> things<00:05:01.630> but<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> just<00:05:02.620> wanted<00:05:02.830> you
