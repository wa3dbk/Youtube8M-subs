00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.009
 of high performance which means a 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.530
 high performance decline is an error with 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.330
 a more rounded leg and what 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.909
 It means having a defendant with a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 rounded means that you will give - 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.140
 row and will walk more that will bring 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.810
