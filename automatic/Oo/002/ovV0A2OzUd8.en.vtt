00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
kind of evens out the so it's not such a

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.050 
kind of evens out the so it's not such a
sharp<00:01:56.200> black<00:01:56.440> cherry<00:01:56.740> flavors<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.340> or<00:01:57.909> maybe

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.040 
cutting some of the sweetness yeah it
makes<00:07:02.050> it<00:07:02.200> less<00:07:02.380> sweet<00:07:03.180> definitely<00:07:04.180> it's

makes it less sweet definitely it's

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.350
