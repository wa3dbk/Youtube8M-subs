00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello in this geometrical thing too 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 say this bluetooth speaker 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.900
 which I bought myself as 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.519
 comparatively device to other bluetooth 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.790
 loudspeaker no longer looked 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.900
 and overall, this cycle is 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.730
 loudspeakers certainly not bad 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.260
 but there are better ones in my opinion 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 We can estimate the price 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.189
 is reasonably acceptable also at 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.359
 Amazon pretty good reviews 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.730
 but there are a few, too 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.699
 weak points who are relatively new since 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.369
 april 2013 on the market otherwise too 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 haptics is so far okay's the way 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 plastic that acts quite robust to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 if the thing falls down it works 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 certainly not broken something completely 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 pleasant is this down here a battery 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.989
 is installed 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 It is a normal Nokia battery 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.300
 850 milliliters is enough for about 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.190
 five hours 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 But there are even larger batteries 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 as with 1200 milliamp hours you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.050
 can buy for ten euros 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 so you could go here a bit 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.030
 better equip here are the back 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 connections to load what is special 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 he has a sd card slot and a usb 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 cards usb sticks wherever you are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 thus filing mp3 files can lead to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.460
 otherwise you can talk about it as I said 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 us about bluetooth of course and about one 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 external cable so from the headphones 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.240
 output from the computer or mobile phone and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.640
 that also has an extra 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 headphone output so that you too 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 for example, this via sd or usb 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 supplied if or there or radio 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.890
 on headphones, on the other hand, listening 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.520
 Control is via these buttons 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 up here 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.659
 there is a guide that's all 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 relatively close is not so easy 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.119
 because the thing has basically three modes it 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.119
 has blue usa has bluetooth has sd and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.220
 USB mode has radio and you have to do all that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 control with these buttons and it has 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.820
 also a handsfree that one 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.710
 can take a phone so you have to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 Steer a lot here with these buttons 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.820
 you have to use these keys to loudly quiet 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.630
 Control radio stations in front of radio stations 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.909
 back song for song back phone 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 accept phone hang up radio station 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.450
 search music stop music start 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.490
 and here select the mode radio usb 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.500
 apple 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.060
 and bluetooth that's a bit 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.319
 complicated I think you have that 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470
 maybe try a little bit 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.810
 to want because this device that is indeed 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.280
 in itself very praiseworthy as I think 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 just the radio may be a reason for many 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.190
 be for this device too 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 but decide what you ever see 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.760
 the whole has no antenna and that's why 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 Unfortunately, the radio is not synonymous 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.280
 so tingling so you need 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.230
 I already believe a place with good 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.739
 Received this really well 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.780
 what I can not receive 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.430
 I think I am so good to everyone now 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.170
 bluetooth mode and have the whole thing on 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.730
 The Kindle Fire contacts you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.299
 I play a bit of music 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.299
 just now 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.570
 So you can see the sound is quite good 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.130
 but there is better here in particular 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.270
 not getting well and better 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.060
 if you make it really loud then 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.410
 everything that I do not clank so well 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.040
 I think if I am in the radio now 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 modus go I do now times 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.129
 So I have to go back to the first 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.780
 I'm looking for a station right now 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.159
 made times but they seem to be 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.409
 to have deleted again 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.760
 So that's not very mature and 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.200
 of the problem I have none now 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 bluetooth that means if i am now 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 Switch back the bluetooth again 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.700
 I can not do that automatically 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.019
 kindle play music again but 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.290
 I have to comment again 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.489
 and you see , yes, I have 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.629
 unfortunately not a good one here 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.629
 radio reception found 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.000
 when I'm almost at it right now 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.019
 So that's not all that perfect 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.530
 that's why the thing unfortunately gets from me 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.510
 in the case only three stars now shows 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.380
 He reminds me that I will be back with bluetooth 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.730
 can connect 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.260
 but I just do not think so 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.370
 meaningful one would have here the bluetooth 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.470
 can keep connection 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.100
 in itself good concept with battery of 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.639
 is sometimes changeable house with sd 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.100
 card with usb stick and headphone output 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.389
 and radio and handsfree in the 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.940
 Handy works so well 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.139
 but I think you just have one here 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.180
 a little too much wanted 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.470
 I prefer to concentrate on 1 or 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930
 raise the price 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.770
 for the price unfortunately I find the whole 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.020
 not so optimal 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.060
 The range of the ur of the bluetooth is 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.070
 quite well with a wall in between about 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.260
 six meters and with no wall in between 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.780
 direct view from the device about ten meters 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.940
 that's right 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.380
 that would be but already out of radio 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.080
 you do not work here 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.970
 really good and if only you anyway 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 then you can use bluetooth 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.270
 synonymous equal to another bluetooth 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.040
 buy speakers 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.060
 Thanks for watching and I hope 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.620
 they could do some useful 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.620
