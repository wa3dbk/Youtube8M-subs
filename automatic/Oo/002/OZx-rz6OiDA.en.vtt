00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.279
 hello how are my name is gustavo 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.010
 neri and today I come to teach you 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 how to make this neck or scarf 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.609
 so if you are interested if eating 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.609
 hi how are you 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.739
 but the truth is that it is something very, very, very 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.600
 simple that you occupy very few things and it is 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.210
 that is perfect for those days that do not 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.739
 You know if it 's cold or hot then as 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.300
 you have it in your backpack and when 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.460
 You can see that it's something cold and you get 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.850
 goodbye 'cold the truth is that I every year 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.129
 I do one of these but I always 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.229
 lose in account of where it is and then 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 The truth is that the 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.890
 periods of cold and the truth is that already 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.539
 it merited me to make another 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.970
 technically the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.909
 use is a kind of these knit 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.610
 that you can occupy an old one that you have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.530
 out there I bought mine in clothes from 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.080
 second and the truth is that it did not cost me 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.970
 more than thirty forty pesos not 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.590
 I remember well but I think it is 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.310
 quite convenient because a scarf 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 regularly it costs you like a few 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.550
 100 108 pesos does not depend on much 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.340
 where we buy it, let's see how it is done 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.040
 well as I said we are going to occupy a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 sweater and then look between two things in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.430
 that of your parents a knit sweater that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.120
 no longer occupy or that you do not like much 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.280
 and then the evidence tests things 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.000
 and make sure you do not want it anymore 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.380
 sweater 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.720
 do not go crazy and 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.140
 miserable a sweater that always if you 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.110
 then tasted the tests and see if 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.060
 you really want to make a neck or a 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.340
 scarf with this sweater 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
 As I tell you I got mine in clothes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.180
 of second then it can be a turn 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.140
 good and then we'll snap 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.140
 occupy a sweater and the black one scissors 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.830
 and a needle 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.129
 and well, let's start cutting the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.439
 sweater and let's make a straight line 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.220
 let's cut as if the sweater 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:36.069
 go straight but let's cut a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.079
 centimeter line out so that the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.220
 time to sew makes it easier for us 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.220
 do not look like misshapen 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.140
 mystics were not helping much that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.620
 let's say but it's something very simple 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.680
 cut the top as the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.849
 shoulders like that we're just going to cut 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.849
 straight way 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.370
 do not 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.049
 and once cutting this is only 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.049
 thing to flip the sweater 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.790
 and let's know what we cut 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.790
 First 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.739
 this is something laborious will try to 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.650
 Sew it once and then return it to 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.190
 sew so that nothing is done 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.190
 fraying 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.920
 once we had cooked those two 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.430
 parties will give you back again 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.650
 being ether 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.650
 and let's meet now 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.250
 these parts of the sweater as of the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.290
 shoulder pads we are going to do 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.760
 a kind of hem like the one 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.260
 we do the pants but 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.210
 we just do not go in the parts of 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.730
 up in the same way so that we are not 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.159
 say the hat all ugly 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.290
 and this is the last step I tell you that it is 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.989
 one thing of the simplest the truth 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.850
 It is that you do not complicate anything and you out of 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.920
 many difficulties of the dark 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.350
 and then afterwards it is simply 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.600
 question of you getting creative and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.600
 you combine it with different clothes 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.420
 what do you see to your liking 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.270
 but that they do it and that they have liked 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.270
 really, really, really 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.940
 Another piece of advice I can give you is that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.730
 try that your sweater is like very 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.380
 big so you can go around 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.380
 just like he just did 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.640
 so you know if they would like to do 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.990
 the work is a matter of minutes and then 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.510
 If they do, I would like very much 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.430
