00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
made it into a lamination pouch for 22

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.209 
made it into a lamination pouch for 22
and<00:00:28.740> 17<00:00:29.070> HMR<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> nighttime<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.859> I'm

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and 17 HMR the nighttime use I'm

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.610 
and 17 HMR the nighttime use I'm
thinking<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.759> getting<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.120> dark<00:00:33.600> olive<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.320> or

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620

thinking of getting a dark olive one or
the<00:00:34.829> black<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.750> attaching<00:00:36.750> some

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
reflective material to the front and to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
reflective material to the front and to
the<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.910> way<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> dropped<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the back that way if it is dropped if it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.220 
the back that way if it is dropped if it

lamp around and the reflective material

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.970 
lamp around and the reflective material
will<00:00:49.200> show<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.250> show<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.640> where<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
will show up and show me where it is

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.049 
will show up and show me where it is
inside<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> moment<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> spec<00:00:54.449> 40<00:00:54.899> bullets

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
inside at the moment the spec 40 bullets

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.560 
inside at the moment the spec 40 bullets
the<00:00:57.059> store<00:00:57.360> quite<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.829> more<00:00:59.070> than<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
the store quite a bit bit more than that

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
the store quite a bit bit more than that
the<00:01:00.570> velcro<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.649> noisy<00:01:02.190> I've

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the velcro is a little bit noisy I've

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.630 
the velcro is a little bit noisy I've
got<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> few<00:01:03.239> ideas<00:01:03.559> later<00:01:04.559> quietly<00:01:05.010> down<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> bit

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
got a few ideas later quietly down a bit

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.719 
got a few ideas later quietly down a bit
but<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.689> that's<00:01:06.869> okay<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> ammunition

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but for now that's okay the ammunition

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
but for now that's okay the ammunition
storage<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.260> secure<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:12.630> won't<00:01:12.840> fall

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
storage is quite secure they won't fall

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.969 
storage is quite secure they won't fall
out<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:15.500> another<00:01:16.500> idea<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> had<00:01:18.680> there's<00:01:19.680> two

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
out and another idea I had there's two

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.570 
out and another idea I had there's two
layers<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.610> material<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:22.280> what<00:01:23.280> I've<00:01:23.400> done

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
layers of material there what I've done

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
layers of material there what I've done
I<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.759> placed<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.450> bullets<00:01:25.220> inside<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I just placed the bullets inside the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
I just placed the bullets inside the
material<00:01:26.580> between<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.689> layers<00:01:28.670> pinched

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
material between the two layers pinched

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600 
material between the two layers pinched
it<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.970> put<00:01:30.390> attacking<00:01:30.869> stitch<00:01:31.460> pinched<00:01:32.460> up

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it up put attacking stitch pinched up

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
it up put attacking stitch pinched up
the<00:01:32.759> other<00:01:32.880> side<00:01:33.170> leaving<00:01:34.170> enough<00:01:34.530> room<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the other side leaving enough room so it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.810 
the other side leaving enough room so it
was<00:01:35.880> firmly<00:01:36.420> held<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.950> still<00:01:38.189> easy<00:01:38.400> enough<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
was firmly held but still easy enough to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990 
was firmly held but still easy enough to
pull<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.180> another<00:01:39.590> stacking<00:01:40.590> stitch<00:01:41.000> put

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
pull out another stacking stitch put

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.319 
pull out another stacking stitch put
another<00:01:42.210> bullet<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.810> side<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:44.149> kept<00:01:45.149> on

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
another bullet the other side I kept on

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
another bullet the other side I kept on
doing<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> eventually<00:01:46.710> i'll<00:01:47.159> come<00:01:47.369> up

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
doing that and eventually i'll come up

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810 
doing that and eventually i'll come up
with<00:01:47.549> six<00:01:48.090> compartments<00:01:49.280> once<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.430> had<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
with six compartments once I had the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
with six compartments once I had the
basic<00:01:51.270> compartment<00:01:51.930> spice<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.710> run<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> line

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
basic compartment spice in I run a line

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.200 
basic compartment spice in I run a line
of<00:01:54.000> stitching<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.180> more

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
of stitching down to make it a bit more

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.200 
of stitching down to make it a bit more
secure<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.500> easy<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.700> bullets<00:02:00.030> won't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
secure and easy to use the bullets won't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.240 
secure and easy to use the bullets won't
slide<00:02:00.689> off<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.229> side<00:02:01.259> they'll<00:02:01.860> carry<00:02:02.130> on

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
slide off to one side they'll carry on

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
slide off to one side they'll carry on
down<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> line<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.869> separate

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
down the line of the these separate

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.449 
down the line of the these separate
pages<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:06.270> good<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.429> use

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
pages and the good thing is you can use

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.669 
pages and the good thing is you can use
a<00:02:08.970> number<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:09.629> rimfire<00:02:10.379> ammunition

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
a number of different rimfire ammunition

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.559 
a number of different rimfire ammunition
that's<00:02:11.190> available

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
that's available

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.720 
that's available
the<00:02:12.930> size<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.200> obviously<00:02:13.890> between<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.519> two

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the size is obviously between the two

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.259 
the size is obviously between the two
the<00:02:15.120> hmr<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:17.090> 17<00:02:18.859> 17<00:02:19.859> HMR<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.519> 22<00:02:20.909> lr

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
the hmr and the 17 17 HMR in the 22 lr

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.800 
the hmr and the 17 17 HMR in the 22 lr
it's<00:02:22.139> a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.409> different<00:02:23.359> what<00:02:24.359> I<00:02:24.389> would

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
it's a little bit different what I would

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.429 
it's a little bit different what I would
like<00:02:25.139> to<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.590> perhaps<00:02:25.889> is<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.519> separate<00:02:26.969> one

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
like to do perhaps is get a separate one

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.860
