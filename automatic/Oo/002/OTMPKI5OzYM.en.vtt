what<00:02:59.969> happens<00:03:00.689> when<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:01.950> oil<00:03:02.219> and<00:03:02.549> you're

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
what happens when you put oil and you're

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.890 
what happens when you put oil and you're
filling<00:03:02.939> up<00:03:03.060> well<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.299> pretty<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.599> turns

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
filling up well it pretty much turns

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.679 
filling up well it pretty much turns
into<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.200> bomb<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:06.480> get<00:03:06.569> out<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:08.689> you

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
into a bomb so to get out of that you

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.479 
into a bomb so to get out of that you
put<00:03:09.900> oil<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.439> filling<00:03:10.709> up<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:11.280> die<00:03:12.109> you<00:03:13.109> know

put oil and filling up you die you know

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.699 
put oil and filling up you die you know
pretty<00:03:14.489> self-explanatory

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
pretty self-explanatory

pretty self-explanatory
but<00:03:16.709> anyways<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:21.389> black<00:03:21.720> cap<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
but anyways this black cap here on the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.839 
but anyways this black cap here on the
fill<00:03:22.709> nipple<00:03:23.069> did<00:03:23.340> not<00:03:23.579> come<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:25.519> tank<00:03:26.519> I

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
fill nipple did not come with the tank I

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.670 
fill nipple did not come with the tank I
purchased<00:03:27.629> this<00:03:27.720> separately<00:03:28.169> in<00:03:28.319> my<00:03:28.409> local

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
purchased this separately in my local

purchased this separately in my local
paintball<00:03:28.889> field<00:03:29.250> as<00:03:29.519> well<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.220> slide

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
paintball field as well you just slide

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.960 
paintball field as well you just slide
that<00:03:32.609> on<00:03:33.199> and<00:03:34.199> pop<00:03:35.159> that<00:03:35.189> on<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.879> can

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
that on and pop that on I think you can

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.270 
that on and pop that on I think you can
get<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.269> black<00:03:36.840> cap<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.470> nice<00:03:37.709> gear<00:03:38.040> for

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
get this black cap and a nice gear for

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.280 
get this black cap and a nice gear for
like<00:03:38.400> probably<00:03:38.549> fifty<00:03:39.180> cents<00:03:39.569> or<00:03:39.689> a<00:03:39.720> dollar<00:03:39.810> or

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
like probably fifty cents or a dollar or

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.439 
like probably fifty cents or a dollar or
something<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.970> don't<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.209> like<00:03:42.419> it

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
something I don't know what I like it

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.909 
something I don't know what I like it
it's<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.229> nice

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.770 

all<00:03:46.919> together<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.389> tank

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
all together I really like this tank

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.199 
all together I really like this tank
except<00:03:49.409> for<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.769> 450<00:03:50.459> shots<00:03:50.759> to<00:03:50.909> get<00:03:51.000> off<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
except for the 450 shots to get off of

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.640 
except for the 450 shots to get off of
my<00:03:51.419> tip<00:03:51.659> men<00:03:51.840> but<00:03:53.180> hopefully<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:55.470> know

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
my tip men but hopefully I don't know

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.009 
my tip men but hopefully I don't know
soon<00:03:56.069> but<00:03:56.459> hopefully<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> might<00:03:57.479> be<00:03:57.689> getting<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
soon but hopefully I might be getting a

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.689 
soon but hopefully I might be getting a
soda<00:03:58.259> in<00:03:58.349> chaos<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.120> I'm<00:04:01.189> will<00:04:02.189> see<00:04:02.400> how<00:04:02.519> many

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
soda in chaos and I'm will see how many

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.270 
soda in chaos and I'm will see how many
shots<00:04:03.030> that'll<00:04:03.659> get<00:04:04.009> it's<00:04:05.009> still<00:04:05.250> a

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
shots that'll get it's still a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.449 
shots that'll get it's still a
mechanical<00:04:05.879> marker<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.479> it's<00:04:06.599> blowback<00:04:07.109> but

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
mechanical marker and it's blowback but

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.309 
mechanical marker and it's blowback but
I'm<00:04:08.459> pretty<00:04:09.000> sure<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.540> gonna<00:04:09.629> be<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.900> lot

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a lot

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.899 
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a lot
better<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.799> gas<00:04:11.040> than<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.669> tip<00:04:12.000> Minh<00:04:13.729> just<00:04:14.729> cuz

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
better on gas than a tip Minh just cuz

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.279 
better on gas than a tip Minh just cuz
its<00:04:15.090> hitman<00:04:15.299> demands<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.840> whole<00:04:16.049> lot<00:04:16.229> more<00:04:16.440> but

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
its hitman demands a whole lot more but

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.589 
its hitman demands a whole lot more but

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
I'm not exactly sure about this but you

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.380 
I'm not exactly sure about this but you
gotta<00:04:53.830> take<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.100> bonnet<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.670> right<00:04:54.940> here<00:04:55.180> and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
gotta take the bonnet off right here and

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.230 
gotta take the bonnet off right here and
there's<00:04:56.260> metal<00:04:57.040> shims<00:04:57.430> or<00:04:57.790> they<00:04:57.940> look<00:04:58.090> like

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
there's metal shims or they look like

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.730 
there's metal shims or they look like
washers<00:05:00.270> each<00:05:01.270> time<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.750> take<00:05:01.960> one<00:05:01.990> out<00:05:02.350> and

washers each time you take one out and

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.640 
washers each time you take one out and
lowers<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.130> output<00:05:03.850> pressure<00:05:04.650> probably

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
lowers the output pressure probably

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.960 
lowers the output pressure probably

but<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:14.169> more<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.470> take<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.070> more<00:05:15.280> it

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
but it the more you take out the more it

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.360 
but it the more you take out the more it
lowers<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.940> output<00:05:16.270> pressure<00:05:16.540> but<00:05:17.440> like<00:05:18.220> I

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
lowers the output pressure but like I

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.440 
lowers the output pressure but like I
said<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.610> use<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:18.940> tip<00:05:19.210> in<00:05:19.390> custom<00:05:19.750> 98<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:21.790> you

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
said I use a tip in custom 98 and it you

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.330 
said I use a tip in custom 98 and it you
have<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.930> run<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.200> on<00:05:23.230> high<00:05:23.470> pressure<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.160> don't

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
have to run it on high pressure so don't

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.159 
have to run it on high pressure so don't
even<00:05:24.460> touch<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.860> regulator<00:05:26.860> at<00:05:27.040> all<00:05:27.900> but<00:05:28.900> I

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
even touch the regulator at all but I

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.620 
even touch the regulator at all but I
know<00:05:29.860> I've<00:05:30.100> been<00:05:30.220> rivaling<00:05:30.760> sorry<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.540> know

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
know I've been rivaling sorry I know

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.200 
know I've been rivaling sorry I know
I've<00:05:31.840> been<00:05:31.930> rambling<00:05:32.410> on<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.880> you're<00:05:33.880> just

anyways pros and cons is tank it's 50

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.270 
anyways pros and cons is tank it's 50
bucks<00:05:37.919> it's<00:05:38.919> high<00:05:39.370> pressured<00:05:39.820> air<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:41.280> it's

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
bucks it's high pressured air and it's

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.850 
bucks it's high pressured air and it's
four<00:05:42.550> dollars<00:05:42.700> to<00:05:43.150> fill<00:05:43.500> for<00:05:44.500> high<00:05:44.590> pressure

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
four dollars to fill for high pressure

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.650 
four dollars to fill for high pressure
air<00:05:47.430> negatives<00:05:48.430> are<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:48.880> it's<00:05:49.180> kind<00:05:49.540> of

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
air negatives are it's it's kind of

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.010 
air negatives are it's it's kind of
heavy

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
heavy

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.180 
heavy
I<00:05:50.229> mean<00:05:51.419> it's<00:05:52.419> it's<00:05:52.780> it's<00:05:53.200> got<00:05:53.590> weight<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:54.010> it

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
I mean it's it's it's got weight to it

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.150 
I mean it's it's it's got weight to it
we'll<00:05:54.880> just<00:05:54.910> leave<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.390> at<00:05:55.479> that<00:05:55.919> but<00:05:56.919> when<00:05:57.070> you

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
we'll just leave it at that but when you

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.620 
we'll just leave it at that but when you
get<00:05:57.250> on<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.610> gun<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:57.850> you're<00:05:58.180> out<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.419> plane

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
get on the gun and you're out the plane

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.310 
get on the gun and you're out the plane
it's<00:05:58.810> not<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.169> bad

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
you only get about 450 shots off with it

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.570 
you only get about 450 shots off with it
and<00:06:06.330> about<00:06:07.330> 500<00:06:07.990> depending<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.560> marker<00:06:08.950> so

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580
