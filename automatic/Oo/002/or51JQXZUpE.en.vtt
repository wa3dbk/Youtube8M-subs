it<00:01:02.399> yet<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.179> there<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it yet I'm going to get there it's a I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410 
it yet I'm going to get there it's a I
think<00:01:05.160> it's<00:01:05.309> probably<00:01:05.399> about<00:01:05.610> 13<00:01:06.119> feet<00:01:06.360> long

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
think it's probably about 13 feet long

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.609 
think it's probably about 13 feet long
and<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.929> probably<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.289> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.440> biggest

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
