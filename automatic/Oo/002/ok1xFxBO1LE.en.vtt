 Hi everyone! How are you? My name is Felipe. 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.480
 of use and with whom we will not go too 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.280
 plus a simple click 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's time to have fun it's time to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.990
 Photographing Your Dog Outdoors 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.859
 photographing a pet is very 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.019
 cool 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.359
 everyday someone posted on social networks 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.610
 a photo of your pet but you want to do 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.379
 a more interesting photo right then 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.019
 leaves the cell phone a little aside and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.989
 the most appropriate equipment 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.550
 Your friend deserves a lot of action is the first 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.140
 thing that comes to mind when you think 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.000
 in photographing dogs 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.010
 the more freedom you owe your 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.290
 dog move better 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.420
 make him run jump play in places 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.860
 open like squares or parks 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.220
 if you intend to take photos as 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.220
 these 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.420
 I recommend a zoom lens 55,051 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.450
 Great you can use another telephoto 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.240
 set the camera to the sport mode that is 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.680
 this setting here is the sport mode of the canon 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.420
 adds two tools that are 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.290
 in a photo full of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.990
 movement 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.840
 the photos collection that the shutter button 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 tight to the middle keeps the focus 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.490
 even with the dog moving 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.259
 within the frame and the continuous shooting 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 makes the shutter speed faster 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.789
 quick help do not miss any moment 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.509
 generating fun and very 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.850
 action 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.890
 a tip that is also important is if 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.229
 position at dog height 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 this way you put yourself at the point of 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.430
 most interesting view with the bug is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.200
 better to see your face get into your 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.130
 the world and create a less 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.710
 predictable 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.110
 enjoy and create a scene come close 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 make pictures could angle 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.780
 photographing well from the bottom up by 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.850
 example it is always good to have a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.440
 toy like this one snack for 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.390
 to catch the dog's attention and to 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.099
 that he looks at you for that kind of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.770
 dog photo that asks for bigger 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.750
 approach a 40 or 50 lens 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.819
 millimeters of the canon with the aperture well 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.770
 great for a nice discount of the background is 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.870
 more than the indicated but the opening 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.900
 large mean smaller focal field 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.730
 so much attention on a beautiful portrait 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.310
 focus is on the eyes and not on the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 snout as we have just seen and 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 photographing your puppy is not only 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.140
 point the camera and push the button 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.270
 I hope this tutorial has been given 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.880
