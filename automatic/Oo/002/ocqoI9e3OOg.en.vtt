00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.390 

but<00:02:22.970> even<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.750> bad<00:02:23.959> fly<00:02:24.319> cast<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:25.250> in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.980 

I<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:42.130> love<00:02:42.430> when<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> fish<00:02:42.940> takes<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.450> fly

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
I really love when the fish takes a fly

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.480 
I really love when the fish takes a fly
especially<00:02:44.770> when<00:02:44.890> fishing<00:02:45.130> with<00:02:45.460> a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
especially when fishing with a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.160 
especially when fishing with a
double-handed<00:02:45.970> fly<00:02:46.330> rod<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> strong

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
double-handed fly rod with a strong

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.560 
double-handed fly rod with a strong
current<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.430> size<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.970> fish<00:02:49.150> really

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
current the size of the fish really

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.780 
current the size of the fish really
doesn't<00:02:50.020> matter<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.590> take<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.250> still<00:02:51.460> always

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
doesn't matter the take is still always

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:19.350 
doesn't matter the take is still always
very<00:02:52.240> distinct

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.140 

I<00:03:19.420> soon<00:03:20.110> realize<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:21.160> isn't<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.820> be<00:03:21.940> an

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
I soon realize this isn't going to be an

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.240 
I soon realize this isn't going to be an
epic<00:03:22.480> struggle<00:03:22.660> since<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.650> trout<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.100> too

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
epic struggle since the trout is too

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:43.780 
epic struggle since the trout is too
small

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.720 

and<00:03:43.879> then<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.719> can<00:03:44.900> see<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.260> fish<00:03:45.469> it's<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.459> small

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
and then I can see the fish it's a small

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.479 
and then I can see the fish it's a small
silvery<00:03:47.420> sea<00:03:47.659> trout<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.349> fish<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.459> just
