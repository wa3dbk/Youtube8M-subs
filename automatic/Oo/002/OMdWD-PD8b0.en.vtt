00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 here we are with the great champion 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 mexican jackie nava from the city of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.220
 mexico that does not come from one of two 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.350
 great battles against the sea and actors 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:17.880
 and now rival in door until the next 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.609
 May 5th 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.130
 she is Colombian that has scratched and comes 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.990
 with a group in his record says a lot 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.670
 experience we have seen the most a couple of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.550
 fights network of her there is not much material 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
 but hey we know that he has fought 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 then higher than this test 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 pretty strong and holds on everything 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 so I think that this training 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.469
 the speed the speed at which we 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 have to get ahead 58 here you know 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.969
 that it is inevitable to talk about battle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 when I marry towers that we interviewed you 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.809
 that fight of good go to the history of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 Mexican boxing you have both solidarity 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 done and also reading what they were already 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 that in summary that what is your 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 thought those fights then finally 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.780
 they have taken us out 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.840
 I think a lot of people came back to see us 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.950
 I think it's the delivery of the two above 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.950
 of the ring I think it's 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.650
 has put in it 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.010
 in another on another level so well then 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.680
 for my part this 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.350
 I left everything in the ring I 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.780
 tried to be better every time and good 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.580
 thanks to the people that seems to be the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.090
 third is negotiating the third and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.500
 we are waiting for that question in case 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 of trilogy like when more or less 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.140
 Latin America in the whole world 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.950
 according to the people I know there are I know 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.539
 there are comments good bad comments 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 work in that m 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.220
 I enjoy my work I try to be 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.930
 better every time learn from learning from 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.319
 business both good and bad so 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.510
 Well it's like a woman I say and we know 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.700
 that not everyone accepts it, not the course of 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 Menhir but hey it's a sport for me 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 it's a top ring sport is this 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.709
 not just throwing punches another one that is 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 this is a technique is mentality is 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.510
 discipline constancy this 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.700
 but so that they know it more inside
