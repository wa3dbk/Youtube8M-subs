00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.780

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.210
 years and a half 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 my name is clear that my holy self 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.180
 I'm 12 years old from the state college 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 So I'm at home dancing. 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.140
 time about two weeks 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.610
 It's dance, it 's what I want for my life. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.930
 and work is very important to me 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 mainly because it was where I 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.369
 I started dancing in the truth. 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.220
 in the church there my neighbor was studying at 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.990
 dancevic gabriel sign me up 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.420
 changes has always been where I learned a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.640
 different way of expressing myself through 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.840
 dance and it was where I chose the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.060
 career that I want to follow my 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.090
 life has many schools watching the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.289
 People, I think, are pleasing a lot of people. 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.789
 because we have patients receiving 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.069
 invitation to dance 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.500

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.530
 ecology 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.780
 even people who did not know the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.580
 who end up getting to know the show itself 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.399

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.380
 when we thought about making a 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.060
 work in 2012 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.459
 is precisely in the training process 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.080

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.000
 this issue alone has this characteristic 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.230
 this language that will mix poetry 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.760
 with dance 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.590
