00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
this is what I do I take each hot dog

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500 
this is what I do I take each hot dog
and<00:00:58.500> cut<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> about<00:00:59.239> 3/4<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.629> through

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
and cut it about 3/4 of the way through

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.850 
and cut it about 3/4 of the way through
and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.539> split<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> open<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.129> this

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and you split it open just like this

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.820 
and you split it open just like this
then<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.189> cheese<00:01:08.580> slice<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> fold

then I take my cheese slice then I fold
it<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.330> forests<00:01:19.130> are<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.310> origami<00:01:20.880> cheese

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it in forests are like origami cheese

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.710 
it in forests are like origami cheese
slices<00:01:21.600> here

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.440 

to<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.650> slice<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.160> this<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to make a slice like this and put it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
to make a slice like this and put it
inside<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.910> then<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.900> take<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:32.000> dough

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
little bit of extra flavor so that's

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.949 
little bit of extra flavor so that's
what<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> currently<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.600> after<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.870> get

okay<00:03:58.069> I<00:03:58.310> just<00:03:58.730> rolled<00:03:58.939> my<00:03:59.090> last<00:03:59.330> one<00:03:59.799> put<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.890> on

okay I just rolled my last one put it on
the<00:04:01.099> tray<00:04:02.650> there<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.769> old<00:04:03.890> knifes<00:04:04.220> lined<00:04:04.549> up

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
the tray there the old knifes lined up

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.250 
the tray there the old knifes lined up
cheese<00:04:05.599> side<00:04:05.900> up<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.760> did<00:04:07.810> spray<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> little<00:04:09.140> bit

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
cheese side up I did spray a little bit

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.740 
cheese side up I did spray a little bit
of<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.620> cooking<00:04:10.370> spray<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.879> here

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
of the cooking spray on here

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.240 
of the cooking spray on here
that<00:04:12.049> way<00:04:12.200> it'll<00:04:12.470> come<00:04:12.709> off<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.890> little<00:04:13.159> bit

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
that way it'll come off a little bit

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.520 
that way it'll come off a little bit
easier<00:04:13.720> even<00:04:14.720> though<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.989> instruction<00:04:15.349> says

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
easier even though the instruction says

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.900 
easier even though the instruction says
not<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:15.950> find<00:04:16.549> it's<00:04:16.760> easy<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:21.669> okay

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
not to I find it's easy to do that okay

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.870 
not to I find it's easy to do that okay
