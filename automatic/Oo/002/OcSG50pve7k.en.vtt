00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.679 

one<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.860> the<00:00:16.950> reasons<00:00:17.190> why<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.400> ride<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.210> on

one of the reasons why this ride is on

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.810 
one of the reasons why this ride is on
the<00:00:18.840> bucket<00:00:19.200> list<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the bucket list is because it is so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.510 
the bucket list is because it is so
unique<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.619> don't<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.099> of<00:00:23.220> anywhere
