00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.099
 hydration to my hair now in summer 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.159
 as good we expose the hair to 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.569
 stronger aggressions as good not 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 of external aggressions but in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 summer as we are more time to air 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.860
 free then those aggressions 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.850
 as more damaging to our skin and 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.530
 our hair and well then I the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.329
 product that I am using is not only 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.239
 for the dog I also use for the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.329
 body but above all I am 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.940
 using to hydrate my hair it 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.239
 try this argan oil from ccoo 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.070

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.510
 he explains that we can use it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.250
 Apply directly on the skin 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.800
 clean and massage until your complete 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.350
 absorption add it to your shower apply it to the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.509
 face as a make-up base enriches 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.429
 your moisturizer take care of your 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.910
 hair from external aggressions and 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.830
 revitalize your nails well here I have 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.179
 read more or less but here explains how 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.520
 you can do it to revitalize the 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.560
 nails for good hair care 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.970
 for hair care it says there 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.220
 than apply it and apply it directly 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.560
 all over your hair 30 minutes before 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.330
 Apply the shampoo repeat once to the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 good week this depends because if 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.200
 you have very fatty hair do it once 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.790
 a week the only thing that I will do 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 I believe is to oil the most the hair 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.920
 I use it when I notice my hair very 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.220
 dried for example followed to the pool 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.500
 many days during that week or during 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.010
 a period of time so if you notice me 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.770
 the hair much drier and I use that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.670
 every person and every person is a world 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.200
 then each one, then when you 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 see when you have time because 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.240
 also this takes so long I take time 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.600
 in applying I have a lot of hair and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.539
 very long and good now I am going to tell you 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.379
 how do I do it 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.780
 the pot brings 50 milliliters and is worth 850 yo 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.349
 I bought it as I said in perfumery 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.310
 It's great but you can get it 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.140
 better is not brand but another similar one in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 any perfume to which you pilla 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.560
 closer this is to put that is oil 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.379
 100% pure first cold pressure 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.659
 presents organic farming I do not think 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.430
 that is rather in 50 milliliters me 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.810
 It puts a lot of look how I wear it I've already 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.810
 used all summer 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.610
 and it spreads a lot, I do not know, it does not seem like a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.730
 exorbitant price seems to me quite 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.130
 Affordable comes with diffuser with a 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.830
 opening and turning does not open and it 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.270
 close and well I 'm not going to you now 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.000
 I'm going to put it on because I washed yesterday 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.910
 hair but I'll explain to you with water 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.940
 I pick up a brush of those who are that 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.209
 you come in neceser is good vital 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.970
 need that shows somewhere I 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.670
 I use this because with this I start 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.860
 a lot of hair and he used this part 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 what I do is with a hair clip 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.120
 I'm going to separate a bit what I do is 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.120
 I'm going 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.950
 I pick up my hair here up here 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.890
 I do not know if you will see it well because the sun 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.540
 is coming and I do not know what to do 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.710
 I pick up here my hair left me 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.190
 here a tuft quoted melo combed 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.980
 I give you 2 tints or those that you need 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:56.380
 depending on waters and soft for not 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.680
 you have to treat it with affection as well a 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.680
 bit 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.550
 and left on this side and then 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.600
 I take another strand cited 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.940
 it is from here 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.940
 I go back to pick up my hair up here 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.910
 and I again and again two masters 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.690
 to extend 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.690
 for all 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.390
 and comb again and then already once 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.880
 I have strands as well as this amount 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.480
 I'm separating them now I'm not going to gather 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.080
 with this one 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.689
 Now what I do is 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.729
 take out this here and I put it in the 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:51.060
 another good side this one is bigger but 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.189
 that as you can see, I pick up locks 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.509
 As they go out, they do not have to 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.330
 be an exact science and take the 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.820
 amount of hair equal every time then 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.500
 comb 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.650
 the steps and I put here around here 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.860
 well for the tip massaging well and another 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.590
 I'll come back with just this one 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.220
 and then like this when I have all the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.740
 hair 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.140
 all full of oil that you will see 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.870
 it seems that you have wet hair what 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.290
 I do that I take it all with the clamp 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.290
 in a bun 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.779
 and it stayed that way 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.509
 the time you want 30 minutes is what 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:39.169
 minimum and good the minimum what it puts 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.479
 here 30 minutes before harvest but 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.449
 come on I can be a whole day with 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:48.009
 this was very dry very lay down and a 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:52.159
 whole day with oil so good 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.809
 that 's my advice too in the video 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.859
 the hull of August mercadona os 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:00.459
 teach the mercadona oil the 

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.459
 sale 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.580
 this 24 oil look like I have it already 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.629
 this is the one that uses me this is not what 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.849
 used in the hair because it carries 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.770
 silicones, but this one does 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.409
 I put myself for the body for this area 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.050
 that to moisturize it more for stretch marks 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.090
 is that I'm not using it very few 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.729
 times for the body I use it for the 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.610
 hair so I do not expect anything 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.289
 liked I wanted to tell you that there are times that 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.080
 you ask me what lipstick I have 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.670
 is this from kiko 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.310
 I've been watching 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:41.070

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.070

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.930
 It's a pink bubble gum that I love and now 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.870
