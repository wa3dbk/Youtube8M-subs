00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.709
 welcoming friends we continue our lessons 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.849
 in the composition of the tournament let's not see 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.130
 how can you 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 start recording video in this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.589
 the program 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.869
 and as I said in the past, we have lessons 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:21.730
 for 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.039
 video recording 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.429
 there is such a button which 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.259
 call the screen entry let's 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.390
 we'll see 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810
 what it looks like 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 but see what appears like this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.210
 Here is a window such a panel 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.840
 allows you to manage records 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.810
 and if we need to choose 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.540
 some particular area 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.280
 specifically 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 and part of the program and part of the document or 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.520
 part of the greedy we need 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 take advantage of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.100
 here is this button 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 and here we can choose for the first time 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.930
 some standard resolution 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 if we need it 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.750
 and here there is also a button which 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.520
 allows 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 do what I said 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.680
 let's first come to the Crimea 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.210
 folder 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.610
 and see how it looks but for this 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.230
 push 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.980
 This button and imedi that if in May we bring 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.090
 on some 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.980
 specifically in 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.930
 then the program automatically 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 identifies and highlights 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630
 that is, if we want to be careful what 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.460
 happens 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.550
 specifically here are our tents 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 that can bring to the edge 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.300
 the program will only shoot what 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.170
 happening in this area 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530
 and if we don't need all this area we 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 we can only be limited to 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 and the main window itself is the data folder 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.700
 so we choose so us 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.690
 is necessary 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.230
 we click in the area um 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.870
 Already recording will occur 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.479
 specifically within 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.590
 this area 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.110
 and just as well we can choose those who are all 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.430
 screen that is everything in the area of ​​the crane can 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.050
 just point at 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.750
 the edge of the rivers screen is visible 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.340
 that areas of 10 spilled out and now 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.429
 recording will occur 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.060
 specifically per year 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090
 these limits 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 and now we need to make sure 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740
 Firstly, the sound is right 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.179
 we have a properly connected microphone 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:13.569
 and this shows 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 this indicator 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.270
 if you say and here 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.029
 happens 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.849
 some movement 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.799
 but we see that there is such a here 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.279
 green jumping strip it means 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.139
 that your microphone is active he is now 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.379
 key and recording will be made 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.260
 fine 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.719
 tips to put the data slider 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.520
 somewhere a little more than half 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.220
 for recording to be normal without 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.710
 so that there is no distortion 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.729
 incomprehensible noise 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.229
 but to make sure the microphone is set 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.489
 which is necessary 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.540
 or choose a microphone is enough 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.429
 click here 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.319
 my legs drop out 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.589
 among this list choose 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.349
 the microphone you need if you 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.579
 just don't know for sure 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.749
 And by typing, you already have to press in 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.229
 end up watching 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.139
 and what happens to this indicator 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.599
 does it work or not 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.969
 it should work of course 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.829
 and here you can also have keys for 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.680
 cameras if you need it that is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.559
 parallel 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.579
 she will go recording also her camera 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.350
 and after you have chosen 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.409
 region 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.259
 records after you 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.879
 decide that you have a microphone 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.609
 It works enough to press a button 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.099
 records she have such a big round 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.099
 red 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.959
 not to notice it is very difficult 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.959
 let's live on this button 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.719
 on seeing that we have gone the countdown 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.729
 and then we see that 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.199
 recording started 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.879
 this panel has changed a bit and now 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.479
 here under reflected 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.919
 the amount is recorded in time that is 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.409
 the duration of your future lesson 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.249
 here we see again our indicators 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.989
 it works, everything is fine 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.490
 they are some more buttons that can 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.519
 remove 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.919
 stop we go 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
 and make a temporary pause 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.469
 and start the video again 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.059
 and gave you the need to record the video itself 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.369
 and hold 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.389
 and your video tutorial be like 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.389

 ears need to save it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.759
 mother push the table button 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.889
 and then we have this 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.139
 here's the window 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.039
 in this window we can 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.360
 make a preliminary 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.960
 viewing if we have it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.340
 need to 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.919
 that is, if we see that we have a lesson 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.919
 initially failed already we can it 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.449
 simply 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.800
 and if we just want to save it 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.699
