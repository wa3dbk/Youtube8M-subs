00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.390 

New<00:00:03.300> Beetle<00:00:03.510> headlight<00:00:04.110> ball<00:00:04.859> should<00:00:05.220> be

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
New Beetle headlight ball should be

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.820 
New Beetle headlight ball should be
fairly<00:00:05.910> straightforward<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.690> replace<00:00:07.080> but

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
fairly straightforward to replace but

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.120 
fairly straightforward to replace but
sometimes<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> real<00:00:09.330> pain<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> ass

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
sometimes can be a real pain in the ass

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
sometimes can be a real pain in the ass
there's<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.190> little<00:00:11.460> hook<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:12.269> gotta<00:00:12.509> push<00:00:12.990> up

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
there's a little hook you gotta push up

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
there's a little hook you gotta push up
but<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> same<00:00:14.549> time<00:00:14.820> there's<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> little

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
but at the same time there's a little

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.120 
but at the same time there's a little
tab<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.750> got<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> push<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
tab you got to push in first so that the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.450 
tab you got to push in first so that the
hook<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.400> able<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> move<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.289> pushing<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hook is able to move so I'm pushing the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.880 
hook is able to move so I'm pushing the
little<00:00:20.699> tab<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.210> then<00:00:21.300> slide<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> hook<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.560> at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
little tab and then slide the hook up at

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.650 
little tab and then slide the hook up at
the<00:00:23.100> same<00:00:23.310> time<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> head<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.330> headlight

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the same time the head and headlight

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.689 
the same time the head and headlight
assembly<00:00:25.080> should<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.439> sliding<00:00:25.949> forward<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
assembly should be sliding forward and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.140 
assembly should be sliding forward and
out<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> fender<00:00:28.080> housing<00:00:29.150> sometimes

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
out of the fender housing sometimes

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.319 
out of the fender housing sometimes
shifty<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:32.070> hook<00:00:32.250> doesn't<00:00:32.550> move<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:33.030> whether

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
shifty the hook doesn't move up whether

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
shifty the hook doesn't move up whether
the<00:00:34.140> headlight<00:00:34.500> assembly<00:00:34.530> doesn't<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the headlight assembly doesn't want to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.209 
the headlight assembly doesn't want to
come<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.989> basically<00:00:37.230> push<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
come out and have to basically push and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.920 
come out and have to basically push and
coax<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> same

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
coax it from the back is at the same

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.400 
coax it from the back is at the same
time<00:00:40.399> as<00:00:41.480> lifting<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> hook

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.029 

obviously<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.860> plastic

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
obviously because it's plastic

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.100 
obviously because it's plastic
components<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> got<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.450> careful<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.960> how

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
components you got to be careful on how

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.670 
components you got to be careful on how
much<00:00:49.289> pressure<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.829> apply<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.469> case

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
much pressure you apply so in that case

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
much pressure you apply so in that case
if<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> doesn't<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> move<00:00:53.610> forward<00:00:53.879> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
if it doesn't want to move forward just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.959 
if it doesn't want to move forward just
coax<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> forth<00:00:55.760> until<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
coax it back and forth until the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:58.480 
coax it back and forth until the
assembly<00:00:57.360> pops<00:00:57.629> free

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.760 

once<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.299> Assembly's<00:01:59.780> popped<00:02:00.260> out<00:02:00.470> far

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
once the Assembly's popped out far

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.230 
once the Assembly's popped out far
enough<00:02:00.920> -<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.280> pretty<00:02:01.520> much<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:01.729> grab<00:02:02.210> it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
enough - you pretty much just grab it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.830 
enough - you pretty much just grab it
and<00:02:02.600> blow<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.140> rest<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.560> way

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.020 

then<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.829> remove<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.189> back<00:02:07.369> cover<00:02:07.399> to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
then you just remove the back cover to

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:20.070 
then you just remove the back cover to
gain<00:02:08.840> access<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.530> vault

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.300 

it's<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.200> little<00:02:21.470> beam<00:02:21.590> that's<00:02:21.830> being<00:02:22.010> replaced

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
it's a little beam that's being replaced

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's a little beam that's being replaced
you<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.880> disconnect<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.570> wire<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you just disconnect the one wire and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.650 
you just disconnect the one wire and
then<00:02:25.430> there's<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.670> spring<00:02:26.030> clip<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.480> holds

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
then there's a spring clip that holds

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:37.000 
then there's a spring clip that holds
the<00:02:26.960> bulb<00:02:27.230> against<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:29.200> fixture

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.650 

installation<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.129> in<00:02:38.250> Reverse

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.600 

Bob<00:02:45.200> only<00:02:45.470> fits<00:02:45.830> one<00:02:45.920> way

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:58.510 

put<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.270> sprinkler<00:02:49.750> back<00:02:49.960> over

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.960 

attach<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.420> wiring

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.840 

put<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.570> cover<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:06.190> because<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.550> had

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
put the cover on now because I had

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.460 
put the cover on now because I had
problems<00:03:07.360> sliding<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.020> assembly<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:10.470> ended

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
problems sliding the assembly out ended

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.490 
problems sliding the assembly out ended
up<00:03:11.560> being<00:03:12.420> some<00:03:13.420> dirt<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.750> debris<00:03:14.320> that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
up being some dirt and debris that

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.430 
up being some dirt and debris that
caused<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.040> plastic<00:03:15.760> slider<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.570> hang<00:03:16.930> up<00:03:17.110> a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
caused this plastic slider to hang up a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.680 
caused this plastic slider to hang up a
little<00:03:18.100> bit<00:03:18.280> liquid<00:03:18.640> grease<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.210> then

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
little bit liquid grease and then

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.460 
little bit liquid grease and then
working<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.320> slider<00:03:21.280> back<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.880> forth<00:03:22.470> freed

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
working the slider back and forth freed

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250 
working the slider back and forth freed
it<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.740> as<00:03:24.490> well<00:03:24.670> as<00:03:24.880> there's<00:03:25.210> a<00:03:25.240> piece<00:03:25.990> here

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
it up as well as there's a piece here

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930 
it up as well as there's a piece here
that<00:03:26.470> needed<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.770> be<00:03:26.860> pumped<00:03:27.280> back<00:03:27.430> into<00:03:27.490> place

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
that needed to be pumped back into place

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.420 
that needed to be pumped back into place
it<00:03:28.210> popped<00:03:28.480> out<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.960> that<00:03:29.920> caused<00:03:30.160> some

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
it popped out and that caused some

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.600 
it popped out and that caused some
binding<00:03:30.850> as<00:03:30.970> well<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:32.350> with<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.710> slide<00:03:33.310> now

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
binding as well so with the slide now

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.960 
binding as well so with the slide now
back<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:34.180> correctly<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.730> lubricated<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
back in correctly and lubricated the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.840 
back in correctly and lubricated the
thing<00:03:37.930> should<00:03:38.230> go<00:03:38.380> back<00:03:38.560> together<00:03:38.950> nicely<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
thing should go back together nicely and

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.320 
thing should go back together nicely and
come<00:03:40.540> apart<00:03:40.870> nicer<00:03:41.380> too

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.000
