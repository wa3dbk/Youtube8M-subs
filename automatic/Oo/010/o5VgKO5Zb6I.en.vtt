I'm going to use the caliber measure the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.900 
I'm going to use the caliber measure the
wire

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.680 

mark<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.060> with<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> sharpie<00:01:52.750> marker<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:54.690> then

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
mark it with a sharpie marker and then

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.660 
mark it with a sharpie marker and then
we're<00:01:55.840> going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:55.990> sawed<00:01:56.380> off<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.430> want<00:01:57.610> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
we're going to sawed off you want to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.460 
we're going to sawed off you want to
make<00:01:57.760> sure<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.630> blade<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:59.050> loaded

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
make sure that the blade is loaded

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.050 
make sure that the blade is loaded
properly<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.520> remember<00:02:03.520> makes<00:02:03.790> that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
properly and remember makes that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:17.100 
properly and remember makes that
instrument<00:02:04.720> sound<00:02:15.180> both<00:02:16.180> sides<00:02:16.630> should<00:02:16.930> have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
instrument sound both sides should have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.080 
instrument sound both sides should have
flat<00:02:17.410> surfaces<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.370> when<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.730> bend<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
flat surfaces so that when you bend the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.620 
flat surfaces so that when you bend the
metal<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.600> turns<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> two<00:02:21.880> ends<00:02:22.360> meet

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
metal it turns to the two ends meet

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.680 
metal it turns to the two ends meet
perfectly<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.640> by<00:02:24.940> using<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.420> number

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
perfectly can do that by using a number

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.060 
perfectly can do that by using a number
two<00:02:25.900> half<00:02:26.500> round<00:02:26.770> file<00:02:27.330> gripping<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.800> wire<00:02:29.800> in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
two half round file gripping the wire in

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.240 
two half round file gripping the wire in
your<00:02:30.130> bench<00:02:30.790> pin<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.330> filing<00:02:32.050> long<00:02:32.770> strokes

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
your bench pin and filing long strokes

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.949 
your bench pin and filing long strokes
away<00:02:33.490> from<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.150> at<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.990> same<00:02:35.260> angle<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
away from you at the same angle as the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.110 
away from you at the same angle as the
bench<00:02:38.170> pin<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.860> you're<00:02:39.040> creating<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.820> flat

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
bench pin so you're creating a flat

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.030 
bench pin so you're creating a flat
surface<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.690> next<00:02:44.080> step<00:02:44.290> once<00:02:44.620> you're<00:02:44.860> all

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
surface the next step once you're all

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.350 
surface the next step once you're all
measured<00:02:45.520> is<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.360> anneal<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.750> wire<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
measured is to anneal the wire with the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.600 
measured is to anneal the wire with the
flame<00:02:52.630> I'm<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.920> use<00:02:54.070> an<00:02:54.220> oxygen

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
flame I'm going to use an oxygen

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.080 
flame I'm going to use an oxygen
acetylene<00:02:54.940> torch<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> very<00:02:57.760> hot

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
acetylene torch which is a very hot

acetylene torch which is a very hot
focused<00:02:59.050> flame<00:03:00.570> first<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.810> turn<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:03.370> red<00:03:03.580> one

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
focused flame first you turn the red one

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.740 
focused flame first you turn the red one
on<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.470> gas<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.100> slowly<00:03:07.090> turn<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.450> oxygen

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
on the gas and slowly turn the oxygen

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.390 
on the gas and slowly turn the oxygen
until<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.680> get<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> nice<00:03:09.100> sharp<00:03:09.550> point<00:03:11.400> when

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
until you get a nice sharp point when

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.009 
until you get a nice sharp point when
you're<00:03:12.550> heating<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.970> metal<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.600> want<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> go
