there so now I have an empty peg and a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
there so now I have an empty peg and a
peg<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.360> two<00:00:48.510> loops<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.559> gonna<00:00:49.649> take<00:00:49.800> my

peg with two loops now I'm gonna take my

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
peg with two loops now I'm gonna take my
working<00:00:50.340> yarn<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.670> place<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.239> front<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
working yarn and place it in front of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
working yarn and place it in front of
that<00:00:52.170> middle<00:00:52.500> peg<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.789> ahead

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that middle peg and I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.650 
that middle peg and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:54.090> wrap<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.750> last<00:00:55.110> peg<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.329> I'm<00:00:57.329> simply

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and wrap the last peg and I'm simply

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
and wrap the last peg and I'm simply
going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.109> knit<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> looks

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
going to knit and this is what it looks

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.310 
going to knit and this is what it looks
like<00:00:59.399> from<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> top<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
like from the top just you do to see and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
like from the top just you do to see and
then<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.530> simply<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> take<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.910> bottom

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
then I'm simply going to take the bottom

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.539 
then I'm simply going to take the bottom
two<00:01:03.480> loops<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.290> place<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> top

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
two loops and place them over the top

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
two loops and place them over the top
just<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.090> normally<00:01:06.420> normally<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> unit

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just like I normally normally do it unit

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
just like I normally normally do it unit
it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.670> harder<00:01:09.000> because

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it's just a little bit harder because

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's just a little bit harder because
you're<00:01:09.740> knitting<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.189> many<00:01:11.250> once<00:01:12.180> again<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you're knitting off so many once again I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.920 
you're knitting off so many once again I
am<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> middle<00:01:14.549> loop<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.270> put

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
am going to take the middle loop and put

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
am going to take the middle loop and put
it<00:01:16.020> over<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> next<00:01:16.890> peg<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> can't<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it over the next peg if I can't get it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240 
it over the next peg if I can't get it
also<00:01:18.960> note<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.530> tricky<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:20.040> both

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
also note is it's tricky to get both

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.600 
also note is it's tricky to get both
strands

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
strands

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.580 
strands
and<00:01:23.000> then<00:01:23.330> I'm<00:01:23.450> taking<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:23.750> working<00:01:24.140> yarn<00:01:24.170> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and then I'm taking my working yarn and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.850 
and then I'm taking my working yarn and
placing<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.040> in<00:01:25.190> front<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.840> empty<00:01:27.620> peg

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
placing it in front of that empty peg

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.300 
placing it in front of that empty peg
and<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:29.570> going<00:01:29.810> ahead<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.290> wrap<00:01:30.530> around

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and I'm going ahead and I wrap around

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.630 
and I'm going ahead and I wrap around
the<00:01:31.820> next<00:01:32.120> peg<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.660> then<00:01:33.230> knitting<00:01:33.500> two<00:01:34.310> over

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
the next peg and then knitting two over

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.730 
the next peg and then knitting two over
one<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:35.900> I'm<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.170> gonna<00:01:36.260> do<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:36.470> again

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
one and then I'm just gonna do it again

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.070 
one and then I'm just gonna do it again
here<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.220> do<00:01:37.430> need<00:01:37.640> three<00:01:38.030> stitches<00:01:38.330> or<00:01:38.750> three

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
here you do need three stitches or three

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.110 
here you do need three stitches or three
pegs<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.530> should<00:01:39.680> say<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.250> complete<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.760> eyelid

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
pegs I should say to complete the eyelid

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.380 
pegs I should say to complete the eyelid
stitch<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:43.580> obviously<00:01:43.850> do<00:01:44.120> back<00:01:44.360> to

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
stitch and you can obviously do back to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.000 
stitch and you can obviously do back to
back<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.780> back<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.470> I'm<00:01:45.590> going<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.830> go<00:01:45.920> ahead

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
back to back now I'm going to go ahead

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.650 
back to back now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:46.190> knit<00:01:46.280> three<00:01:46.670> rows<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:47.090> between<00:01:47.300> this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.230 
stitch i knitted two rows than I did in
high<00:02:21.860> Latrobe<00:02:22.190> needed<00:02:22.520> two<00:02:22.670> rows<00:02:22.820> island

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
high Latrobe needed two rows island

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.000 
high Latrobe needed two rows island
throw<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.690> two<00:02:23.900> rows<00:02:24.080> by<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.320> row<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
throw them in two rows by the row so I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.979 
throw them in two rows by the row so I
really<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> created<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.420> lace<00:02:26.660> like

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.090 
know I mean it's a little bit more holy
so<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.600> little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.870> more<00:02:36.080> breathable<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100
