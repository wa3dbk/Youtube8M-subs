00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the pickles themselves goes very well

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.620

with<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.830> barbecue<00:02:23.340> sauce<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.240> meat<00:02:24.480> is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
with that barbecue sauce but the meat is

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.090 
with that barbecue sauce but the meat is
just<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:25.080> little<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> light<00:02:25.800> side<00:02:26.070> is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
just a little on the light side is

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.690 
just a little on the light side is
really<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> meat<00:02:27.060> inside<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:28.490> hmm

really not a lot of meat inside this hmm

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.350 
really not a lot of meat inside this hmm
I<00:02:31.310> mean<00:02:32.310> what's<00:02:32.490> there<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.850> good<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.210> it's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
I mean what's there is good but it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
I mean what's there is good but it's
just<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.630> little<00:02:33.840> lacking<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.530> terms<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just a little lacking in terms of the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.320 
just a little lacking in terms of the
quantity<00:02:35.130> compared<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> picture<00:02:36.150> that's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
quantity compared to the picture that's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.810 
quantity compared to the picture that's
for<00:02:36.540> sure<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.380> flavor<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.890> decent<00:02:38.250> toasted

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
for sure but flavor is decent toasted

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.430 
for sure but flavor is decent toasted
bun<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> pretty<00:02:39.300> good<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.570> well<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.050> onions

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bun is pretty good as well the onions

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.810 
bun is pretty good as well the onions
are<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> nice<00:02:40.860> touch<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.310> think<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.580> would<00:02:41.670> work

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
are a nice touch I think what would work

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.610 
are a nice touch I think what would work
better<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.630> some<00:02:42.960> red<00:02:43.170> onion<00:02:43.500> so

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
better with this is some red onion so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.900 
better with this is some red onion so
you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.250> little<00:02:44.490> bit<00:02:44.610> extra

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you can really get a little bit extra

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.160 
you can really get a little bit extra
pop<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.660> would<00:02:45.780> continue<00:02:46.020> to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
pop I think that would continue to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.810 
pop I think that would continue to
enhance<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.740> barbecue<00:02:47.130> sauce<00:02:47.310> kind<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.700> like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
enhance the barbecue sauce kind of like

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.190 
enhance the barbecue sauce kind of like
the<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> tartness<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.660> pickles<00:02:49.020> does

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the way the tartness of the pickles does

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.130 
the way the tartness of the pickles does
I<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:49.650> key<00:02:53.959> pretty<00:02:54.959> decent

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I think that's key pretty decent

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.810 
I think that's key pretty decent
flavorful<00:02:55.830> enough<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.430> when<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
flavorful enough and when you get the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.350 
flavorful enough and when you get the
two<00:02:56.970> four<00:02:57.180> five<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> bad<00:02:57.930> value<00:02:59.360> all

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
two four five it's not a bad value all

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.970 
two four five it's not a bad value all
