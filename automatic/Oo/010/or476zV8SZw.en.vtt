game<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.829> no<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.489> had<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.670> make<00:02:27.970> your<00:02:28.120> money

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
game but no you had to make your money

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.410 
game but no you had to make your money
didn't<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:29.049> about<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.650> cash<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.579> you<00:02:31.090> buy

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
didn't you all about the cash if you buy

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.690 
didn't you all about the cash if you buy
premium<00:02:31.900> essentially<00:02:32.709> two<00:02:33.129> out<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.489> five

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
premium essentially two out of the five

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.850 
premium essentially two out of the five
map<00:02:33.970> packs<00:02:34.269> should<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.019> been<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.349> disk

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
map packs should have been on the disk

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.850 
map packs should have been on the disk
so<00:02:36.459> really<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.150> premium<00:02:37.840> has<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.290> exist<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
so really if premium has to exist it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.100 
so really if premium has to exist it
should<00:02:39.519> have<00:02:39.610> only<00:02:39.819> cost<00:02:40.239> forty<00:02:40.720> dollars

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
should have only cost forty dollars

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.979 
should have only cost forty dollars
which<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.709> still<00:02:41.980> far<00:02:42.519> too<00:02:42.760> high<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.720> at<00:02:43.870> least

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
which is still far too high but at least

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.979 
which is still far too high but at least
it's<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.379> little<00:02:44.650> bit<00:02:44.799> more<00:02:44.980> reasonable<00:02:45.220> in

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it's a little bit more reasonable in

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's a little bit more reasonable in
Australia<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.200> PC<00:02:47.620> version<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.040> Battlefield

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
Australia the PC version of Battlefield

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.520 
Australia the PC version of Battlefield
4<00:02:48.790> cost<00:02:49.480> $80<00:02:51.180> $80<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.540> P<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.019> console

4 cost $80 $80 and the P and the console

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.030 
4 cost $80 $80 and the P and the console
versions<00:02:53.920> cost<00:02:54.250> about<00:02:54.780> $100<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:56.560> means<00:02:56.859> that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
versions cost about $100 this means that

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.039 
versions cost about $100 this means that
if<00:02:57.159> you<00:02:57.189> bought<00:02:57.489> battlefield<00:02:58.030> 4<00:02:58.239> premium<00:02:58.269> and

the game on PC you would pay a hundred
and<00:03:02.769> forty<00:03:03.159> dollars<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:04.269> game<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.599> has
