 otherwise, the process may 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.370
 drag on for a long time 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.900

 is on joint or not 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.609
 therefore it is better to still get 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.620
 spouse's notarized consent as 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.060

 preparing a sales transaction 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.690

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.560
 leave it or return it if someone 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.260
 of the participants in the transaction will refuse 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.410
 purchases or sales if the buyer 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.379
 gets 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.949
 deposit and write agreement about deposit not 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.430
 the sales contract did not sign 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.540
 this amount is an advance ie 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.859
 it happened gender court practice and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.799
 do not recognize the courts 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.840
 this this this amount by deposit that is there 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.629
 differences in what what if it is you 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.579
 returns if it is a deposit then the country 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.579
 which provided a deposit 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.169
 refuses to conclude further 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.000
 contract mainly sale on and 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.699
 loses so much that passed down 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.680
 should there double loses it and who 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.430
 got yes they must return by war 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.769
 deposit accordingly in this case 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.190
 if just for making an agreement 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.989
 to the deposit then it will be an advance if 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.479
 concluded was a preliminary contract and in 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.940
 The preliminary contract states that 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:12.019

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.239
 amount of payment 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.799
 the amount of the deposit indicates that it is 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.870
 is provisional measures then this 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.100
 will be a mystery when terminating the contract 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 accordingly you can charge double 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.480
 advance payment or deposit should be 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.280
