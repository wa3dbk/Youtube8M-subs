00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.240
 you are already in your segments to go 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.569
 crafts in today you 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.139
 I will teach how to make this cute little shoe 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.969
 They must be nice with points and it's 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 lined in the back the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.680
 materials that we will need are 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.990
 this pattern is very easy of you alone 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.840
 take the scissors and round this part 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.750
 here and then do a little opening 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.570
 more downstairs shy of pizza for 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.260
 do this here below 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.110
 these edges 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.860
 the pencil with if we want to spend it like me 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.480
 I did it here the politicians to do the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.880
 crillon to make these points that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.410
 want to do alone and the drill 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.000
 to make a back hole if they want 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.890
 hang up 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.150
 and the glue to stick the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.040
 surfaces that we are going to use 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.040
 we put silicon here 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.559
 here we put a silicone type 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.230
 we stick it there 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.670
 a little here and a little 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.360
 is as he testified for us 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 and later 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.179
 we add and put deadlines surfaces 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.179
 in the middle of the circle 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 we give them some glue for here 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.750
 as well 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 we do the following in circles 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 same 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.700
 and so we are running the forms of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.700
 our 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 we are going to take a form 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.780
 and we're going to stop silicon by the sides 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.200
 to stick it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.180
 then it is very easy to do 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.060
 If you do not understand the video, you can 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.900
 sue a message to me or my facebook 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 he managed crafts them quickly the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.319
 rest 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.489
 it is staying like this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.489
 and later 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.209
 the palm of the 5 was cut in the part of 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.209
 behind 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.439
 I stick it well and I make a little circle 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.970
 to place it 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.970
 in the part of adela 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.260
 and so it makes us look our lids 5 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.530
 let's catch 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.920
 and we will make public at the error 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.140
 points around the whole 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.840
 and that's not how our 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.780
 apathetic very well very nice and come 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.260
 in today until next week 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.260
 bye bye 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 ah
