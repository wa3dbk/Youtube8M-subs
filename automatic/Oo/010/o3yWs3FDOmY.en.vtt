from<00:00:56.000> corner<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.420> wind<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.379> didn't

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
from corner into the wind and I didn't

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
from corner into the wind and I didn't
do<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.830> because<00:00:59.220> I<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> wind<00:01:00.180> changes<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
do that because I the wind changes I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.369 
do that because I the wind changes I
said<00:01:01.080> enough<00:01:01.350> anyway<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.960> corner

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
said enough anyway so this is one corner

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
said enough anyway so this is one corner
I<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.739> set<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.450> anchor

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I just set up with the the same anchor

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.340 
I just set up with the the same anchor
and<00:01:07.500> I've<00:01:07.680> done<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.360> all<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.840> other<00:01:09.990> corner

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.359 
now double thing but luckily you have
trekking<00:01:19.680> poles<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.180> buried<00:01:21.920> one<00:01:22.920> trekking

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
trekking poles so I buried one trekking

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
trekking poles so I buried one trekking
pole<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.910> there's<00:01:24.660> two<00:01:24.869> ways<00:01:25.050> of<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
pole there there's two ways of doing it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.180 
pole there there's two ways of doing it
I<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.920> either<00:01:26.399> bury<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.660> dead<00:01:28.200> men<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:29.160> I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
I can either bury down dead men so I

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.900 
I can either bury down dead men so I
would<00:01:29.520> put<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.200> over<00:01:31.200> its<00:01:31.410> own<00:01:31.590> Tory<00:01:31.910> like

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
would put this over its own Tory like

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.440 
would put this over its own Tory like
that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.260 
that
bury<00:01:33.960> down<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.700> garland<00:01:36.149> around

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
bury down with with the garland around

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.710 
bury down with with the garland around
it<00:01:36.660> or<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.280> case<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.970> used<00:01:39.300> that<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it or in this case I just used that is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.460 
it or in this case I just used that is
basically<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.800> gigantic<00:01:41.479> peg<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.930> stake

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
basically as a gigantic peg or stake

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.430 
basically as a gigantic peg or stake
now<00:01:44.250> obviously<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.030> find<00:01:45.300> some<00:01:45.569> some

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
now obviously you might find some some

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.029 
now obviously you might find some some
rocks<00:01:46.679> or<00:01:46.920> wood<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:48.929> thing<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
rocks or wood to do the same thing but I

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.680 
rocks or wood to do the same thing but I
just<00:01:50.069> made<00:01:50.429> my<00:01:50.610> life<00:01:50.789> difficult<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.450> there

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
just made my life difficult so there

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.639 
just made my life difficult so there
yeah<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:53.069> one<00:01:53.780> bit<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:57.649> innovation

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
yeah that's one one bit of innovation

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.330 
yeah that's one one bit of innovation
some<00:01:59.220> huge<00:01:59.940> peg<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.080> particular<00:02:01.619> point

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
some huge peg now this particular point

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.900 
some huge peg now this particular point
is<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:03.319> load-bearing<00:02:04.319> really<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
is not load-bearing really so the the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.800 
is not load-bearing really so the the
tent<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.330> hand<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.959> there<00:02:07.490> by<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.550> one<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
tent is hand up there by this one so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.040 
tent is hand up there by this one so
what<00:02:10.500> I've<00:02:10.649> done<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:12.270> show<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.370 

I<00:02:22.160> buried<00:02:23.570> I'll<00:02:24.570> take<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.900> down<00:02:24.930> ate<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
I buried I'll take you down ate it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
I buried I'll take you down ate it
otherwise<00:02:25.650> it'd<00:02:26.030> take<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> fall<00:02:27.390> down<00:02:27.570> but

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
otherwise it'd take the fall down but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.870 
otherwise it'd take the fall down but
there<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> shoe<00:02:28.350> inside<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.640> that's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
there is a shoe inside there so that's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480 
there is a shoe inside there so that's
my<00:02:30.060> anchor<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.560> shoe<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
my anchor is the shoe and this is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.730 
my anchor is the shoe and this is
basically<00:02:32.730> how<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.600> dead<00:02:34.500> main

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
basically how you do your dead main

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.190 
basically how you do your dead main
anchor<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.150> something<00:02:36.420> down<00:02:36.810> bury

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
anchor you put something down bury

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.560 
anchor you put something down bury
something<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.830> even<00:02:38.790> deeper<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.390> need

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
something down even deeper if you need

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.990 
something down even deeper if you need
to<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:40.350> cheaper<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.070> load<00:02:41.850> bearing

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
to much cheaper for the load bearing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
to much cheaper for the load bearing
bits<00:02:42.390> abilities<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> did<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> same<00:02:45.980> gain

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
bits abilities now I did the same gain

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.240 
bits abilities now I did the same gain
part<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.520> our<00:02:47.670> despair<00:02:48.300> tracking<00:02:49.080> Holmes<00:02:49.320> I

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
just happened to a fort I can pause here

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.010 
just happened to a fort I can pause here
be<00:02:52.710> into<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> pit<00:02:53.250> person<00:02:53.640> think<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.690> I've<00:02:54.960> used

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
be into a pit person think so I've used

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.690 
be into a pit person think so I've used
one<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:56.160> bit<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:57.990> side<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.670> other

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
one one bit for for this side the other

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.360 
one one bit for for this side the other
one<00:02:59.970> there<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> other<00:03:02.160> side<00:03:02.430> babies

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.040 

this<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.520> actually<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> corner<00:03:10.540> into<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
this is actually the corner into the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.260 
this is actually the corner into the
wind<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.770> I<00:03:12.069> could<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.370> set<00:03:12.610> up<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.120> lot

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
wind and I could have set up this a lot

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.130 
wind and I could have set up this a lot
better<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.910> just<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.360> realized<00:03:16.900> later

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
better but it just I just realized later

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.870 
better but it just I just realized later
on<00:03:17.350> what<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.709> going<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.520> couldn't<00:03:18.730> be

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
on what was going on so I couldn't be

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.820 
on what was going on so I couldn't be
bothered<00:03:19.030> doing<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.510> game<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.650> show

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
bothered doing a game but just to show

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.710 
bothered doing a game but just to show
you<00:03:20.890> what<00:03:21.130> I've<00:03:21.250> done<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:22.600> I<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:24.720> I'm

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you what I've done there is I have I'm

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.390 
you what I've done there is I have I'm
going<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.050> let<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.319> down<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:27.250> will

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
going to let it down so that it will

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.300 
going to let it down so that it will
collapse<00:03:27.700> here<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:28.810> go<00:03:28.959> no<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.650> doesn't<00:03:29.950> anyway

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
collapse here we go no it doesn't anyway

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.880 
collapse here we go no it doesn't anyway
this<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.239> my<00:03:32.700> shovel<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.660> or<00:03:35.080> Spade<00:03:35.350> I've<00:03:35.620> used

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
this is my shovel so or Spade I've used

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.270 
this is my shovel so or Spade I've used
that<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.760> DJ<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.450> same<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.989> yes<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.070> course

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
that to to DJ the same and yes of course

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.220 
that to to DJ the same and yes of course
it<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.519> apart<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.239> do<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.540> with<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.490 

with<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.670> Kings<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.420> Heineken<00:03:46.780> Kings<00:03:47.230> or

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
with the Kings the Heineken Kings or

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.110 
with the Kings the Heineken Kings or
something<00:03:47.890> by<00:03:48.100> anywhere<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:48.700> happen<00:03:49.000> to

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
something by anywhere just happen to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.540 
something by anywhere just happen to
have<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.480> those<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.350> that's<00:03:50.620> what<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:50.980> use

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
have one of those so that's what I use

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.250 
have one of those so that's what I use
but<00:03:51.910> obviously<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.510> idea<00:03:52.780> was<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.019> have

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
but obviously the idea was to have

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.090 
but obviously the idea was to have
something<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:55.380> mice<00:03:56.380> take<00:03:56.709> some

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
something so that the mice take some

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.190 
something so that the mice take some
champions<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.670> be<00:03:57.819> over<00:03:58.060> there<00:03:58.269> now<00:03:58.540> wouldn't

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
champions to be over there now wouldn't

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.160 
champions to be over there now wouldn't
fly<00:03:59.560> away<00:03:59.830> that's<00:04:00.489> it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
fly away that's it

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.680 
fly away that's it
back<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.319> home<00:04:03.030> okay<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.090> if<00:04:04.300> you<00:04:04.450> are<00:04:04.510> at<00:04:04.600> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
back at home okay so if you are at the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.630 
back at home okay so if you are at the
beach<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.470> one<00:04:05.650> thing<00:04:05.860> is<00:04:05.980> for<00:04:06.160> sure<00:04:06.190> is<00:04:06.489> that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
beach and one thing is for sure is that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.530 
beach and one thing is for sure is that
you<00:04:06.880> have<00:04:06.910> st.<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:07.840> that's<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:08.860> you<00:04:08.950> use<00:04:09.540> now

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
you have st. so that's what you use now

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.190 
you have st. so that's what you use now
ideally<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:12.489> would<00:04:12.670> be<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.450> most<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:14.140> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
ideally it would be and most of the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.199 
ideally it would be and most of the
times<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.650> fact<00:04:14.890> actually<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.459> will<00:04:15.640> find<00:04:15.940> ox

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
times in fact actually you will find ox

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.789 
times in fact actually you will find ox
so<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:18.430> will<00:04:18.609> bury<00:04:19.380> something<00:04:20.380> if<00:04:20.530> there<00:04:20.709> be

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
so you will bury something if there be

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.230 
so you will bury something if there be
enough<00:04:21.100> obvious<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.519> can<00:04:21.700> just<00:04:21.910> live<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
enough obvious you can just live in the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.060 
enough obvious you can just live in the
surface<00:04:22.600> otherwise<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.289> bury<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.860> hope

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
surface otherwise you just bury a hope

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.400 
surface otherwise you just bury a hope
like<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.490> as<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.270> as<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.260> dead<00:04:26.620> man<00:04:26.800> anchor<00:04:27.190> so

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
like that as a as a dead man anchor so

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.409 
like that as a as a dead man anchor so
the<00:04:29.410> deeper<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.220> better<00:04:30.370> up<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.850> point<00:04:31.090> a

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
the deeper the better up to a point a

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.650 
the deeper the better up to a point a
couple<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:32.050> feet<00:04:32.229> will<00:04:32.530> do<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> good<00:04:33.340> job<00:04:33.660> or

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
couple of feet will do a good job or

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.080 
couple of feet will do a good job or
you'll<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.320> given<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.220> small<00:04:36.490> log<00:04:36.789> like<00:04:37.060> that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
you'll have given a small log like that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.250 
you'll have given a small log like that
it's<00:04:37.600> it's<00:04:38.560> enough<00:04:38.979> again<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:39.850> put<00:04:40.030> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
it's it's enough again to just put a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.740 
it's it's enough again to just put a
rope<00:04:41.260> around<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:41.979> again<00:04:42.610> buried<00:04:43.030> deep<00:04:43.240> you

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
rope around it and again buried deep you

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.380 
rope around it and again buried deep you
could<00:04:43.960> pass<00:04:44.260> some<00:04:44.669> smaller<00:04:45.669> stones<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.300> you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
could pass some smaller stones if you

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.760 
could pass some smaller stones if you
have<00:04:46.510> anything<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.320> know<00:04:47.440> it's<00:04:47.590> time<00:04:47.740> to

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
have anything that you know it's time to

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.310 
have anything that you know it's time to
flip<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.160> down<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.550> then<00:04:48.669> obviously<00:04:49.140> call<00:04:50.140> as

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
flip it down and then obviously call as

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.190 
flip it down and then obviously call as
much<00:04:50.500> sand<00:04:50.770> as<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.070> can<00:04:51.310> now<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.180> other<00:04:52.450> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
much sand as you can now the other the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.830 
much sand as you can now the other the
typical<00:04:54.070> way<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.280> would<00:04:54.550> do<00:04:54.729> it<00:04:54.910> is<00:04:55.270> if<00:04:55.690> you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
typical way you would do it is if you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.150 
typical way you would do it is if you
don't<00:04:56.050> know<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.320> can<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:56.590> anything<00:04:56.830> is

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
don't know if you can have anything is

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.270 
don't know if you can have anything is
you<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.840> snow<00:04:59.320> saying<00:04:59.800> pegs

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
you have a the snow saying pegs

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.580 
you have a the snow saying pegs
something<00:05:01.030> on<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.330> door<00:05:01.690> better<00:05:02.020> these<00:05:02.320> ones

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
something on that door better these ones

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.040 
something on that door better these ones
but<00:05:02.830> you're<00:05:03.100> not<00:05:03.250> likely<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:03.970> those<00:05:04.750> on

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
but you're not likely to have those on

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.870 
but you're not likely to have those on
the<00:05:05.140> next<00:05:05.380> hike<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:06.250> would<00:05:06.400> have<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.640> little

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
the next hike you would have this little

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.810 
the next hike you would have this little
start<00:05:07.270> if<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.570> know<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.350> build<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.860> camp

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
start if you know that you build a camp

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
but again there are alternatives so for

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.339 
but again there are alternatives so for
example<00:05:25.149> if<00:05:25.239> you<00:05:25.329> just<00:05:25.359> think<00:05:25.719> of<00:05:25.899> it<00:05:26.019> you<00:05:26.259> know
