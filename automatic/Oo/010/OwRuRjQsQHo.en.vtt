00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:17.680
 the alpe adria hgaa most positive very good 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.960
 impact tourism on the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.400
 community that's what I 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.279
 I think that is unique in all of us 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.619
 europe the trail is for his first 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.060
 a tremendous success it is that year 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.470
 most successful hiking project that mine 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.320
 Carinthia ever had never had that over 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.180
 booking center over 400 fax and 2001 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 Real sold know but due 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.290
 told to put that at least 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.000
 20,000 nights lukriert to date 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.920
 really have almost every day 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 keep others from coming in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 trailer are on the road and that is through 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.350
 is growing really positive guys 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.659
 alpe adria drill is really for us 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.760
 a sensation because he just that 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.830
 combines what it's about back there 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.559
 enjoy this joy of life around this 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.500
 this beautiful landscape too 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.809
 experience and feel what I notice 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.619
 is that the customer frequency very well 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.019
 increases 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.890
 So you always see everything 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.350
 bear and what I find especially great 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.229
 is the enthusiasm of this for us 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.710
 i think albert's new target group 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.890
 rist very positive because a lot 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.049
 Scouting come here and also very 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.049
 many things and need 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.950
 Relatively many people in the area 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.590
 come 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.360
 that already has to carry prices there 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 can work economically and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.020
 just that it's summer of these products 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.250
 rather carinthia is all about and where you are 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.660
 all were created and all 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.790
 have made each other and I am there 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.110
 in the future it would make sense to date 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.880
 only positive feedback 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.310
 the guests are enthusiastic about 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.300
 emigration and also at the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.920
 transport services and the hoteliers 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.240
 that works great we have a lot 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 many local food and regular customers 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.260
 as countries on the huts but the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.000
 altmark aktuell brings additional 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.640
 londoner for our cabins and that is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.330
 we are very positive in the operation we say it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.330
 is for our place and for our house 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.100
 really a huge start 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.860
 So we already have many bookings 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 or they are very interested and all 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.600
 are very excited about the game 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.010
 the most positive party is that he is for 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.170
 anyone is walkable 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.830
 and that is really the way he advertised 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 want one in the garden of glockner to 1 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.500

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.660
 from the people who know already committed 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.780
 the way of it for us directly over 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.209
 before coming in again and when 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.070
 then you see us calling and there that 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.019
