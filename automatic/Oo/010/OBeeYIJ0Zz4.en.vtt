 blame that I have this animal that is of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.700
 evaluations that increase everything 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 the thought 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.010

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.000
 black earth 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 what happens just this line that is 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.049
 puts in view does not allow them to pay attention 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.899
 of blood, blood can not 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.880
 reason is why they do things 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.250
 brutal they do as for example 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 send their kids to state school 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.799
 free where nobody knows as 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.420
 with the brutal schools that there are in 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.420
 europe and not kind you saw it 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.739
 the marin institute 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.680
 with these people who do not descend from anyone 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.450
 are as gas hobby 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.430
 you know that if he is poor and that the robbery 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.500
 it makes her beloved frank with half everything 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.930
 the time for treatment 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.340
 what happens that people saw that you have the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.080
 mentality upside down because if one thing 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.090
 someone like a poor person who talks 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.090
 English that is left to Europe 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.010
 among all countries we leave everything 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.930
 eat meat they pull through life as 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.780
 we filthy in the pastera used to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.110
 resentful socially digestive people 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.080
 the mentality does not take taxis 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.460
 He loves to spend collectively but not 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.560
 they take a good collective and they fear that 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.910
 any where your car breaks 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.380
 you take that with more than 2 267 20 thousand 39 that 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.850
 they go to the northern district to the neighborhood park 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.750
 where you do not meet with a 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.750
 well-known maid 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 port wine types 407 520 those 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.480
 depressing numbers dresses 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:43.030
 everyone wants to change everything 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:46.170
 established but do not like how they are 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 against like 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.800
 a friend of mine says they preserve themselves 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.950
 know who will be the work 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.840
 they say everything that goes back 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.870
 and the one that gave the yen to Russia that much 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.830
 they like how they like it so depressing 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.840
 where everyone speaks Russian that nobody 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
 understand you saw this country with its 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.739
 not photogenic leaders are fat 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.739
 what was the woman of crosses 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.930
 that he does not do is because of ideas and 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.030
 they have 14 months the winter 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.009
 I do not tell you with the amount of snow that 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.520
 have the Russians not I would not have done that 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.900
 closed as you saw 18 curtain d'ampezzo 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.320
 but I do not remove iron curtain 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.720
 pasta 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.710
 and you know it 's much more serious what 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.870
 it seems I am here a brutal dimension that 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.240
 it's called the alliance against progress to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 you saw the best people not that you have like 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.230
 fundamental objective to detect the poor 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.849
 saw and separate them because poverty is 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.830
 very contagious 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.959
 and to differentiate them we have invented a 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.369
 brutal test that we will teach 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:55.749
 for you to apply it you saw that 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:57.830
 with your friends and with your parents 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.209
 I do not want to choose anyone of you 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.439
 what happens that I suspect criticism 

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.600
 unfriendly but I will ask for example 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.990
 he has 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.310
 it's called the left but to you that 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.500
 dedicate to someone who seems to have 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.930
 dreaded crawls half poor all this the 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.930
 Balance mind dance because he 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.790
 person with whom I have loved 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.300
 the lady chose it and have wanted 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:27.830
 repeat what I will not just say 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.430
 the one that we go to texts that are not so 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.430
 only U.S 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.109
 the car contact and 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:46.560
 do not force yourself, you can see the neighborhood 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:51.890
 you are poor who came here 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.890
 here do not look them immune to the bell beak 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.550
 bad bitch frontwoman has come for

 new inventions saw that invention 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.730
 scary they have done now they give them 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.950
 agreement I do not know what thing to sink 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.130
 for cancer with everything our great 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.350
 sinister party segment of the dress 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.720
 the depression that just launched the 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.580
 same look that I look at it and I get sick 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.580
 because the agreement sector that is this
