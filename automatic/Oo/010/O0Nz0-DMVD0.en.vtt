00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.030
 but shit listen guys he we 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 two games left to play against 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.110
 marseille the other against senchim cannes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.290
 then it's not at all the moment we 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.290
 mope 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.340
 tell me we record you think we have 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340
 reached our limits 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 I was sure that we were 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.350
 better than we were better but 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.350
 it's clear the score is without appeal 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.070
 I thought well you know I ended up 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.609
 tell me to join forces with 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.589
 pure talent 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.280
 it may not be the ideal solution 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.280
 case 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:18.640
 head under your step usually say 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.910
 nonsense but the reality is obvious 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 I will never find what the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.220
 the only one who can beat me is myself 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 to both matches before wounded kagami is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.950
 stayed on the bench 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.960
 as for sudden curvature drop of 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.960
 diet 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.520
 it's because he saved us so much 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.730
 many times was only the shadow of her 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.730
 even
