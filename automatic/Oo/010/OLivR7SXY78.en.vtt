that's<00:04:04.769> good<00:04:04.980> yeah<00:04:05.459> anyways<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.329> was

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
that's good yeah anyways like I was

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.909 
that's good yeah anyways like I was
saying<00:04:06.629> earlier<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.290> reason<00:04:07.500> why<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.650> think

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
saying earlier the reason why I think

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.050 
saying earlier the reason why I think
this<00:04:08.040> might<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> best<00:04:08.430> Call<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.760> Duty<00:04:08.940> ever

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
this might be the best Call of Duty ever

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.670 
this might be the best Call of Duty ever
is<00:04:09.209> because<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.660> guns<00:04:09.870> are<00:04:09.989> balanced<00:04:10.470> there's

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
is because the guns are balanced there's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.140 
is because the guns are balanced there's
not<00:04:10.949> really<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.310> single<00:04:11.699> gun<00:04:11.910> that's

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
not really a single gun that's

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.879 
not really a single gun that's
ridiculously<00:04:12.750> moreover<00:04:13.230> power<00:04:13.560> than<00:04:13.739> every

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
ridiculously moreover power than every

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.860 
ridiculously moreover power than every
other<00:04:13.949> gun<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:14.699> the<00:04:14.819> UMP<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.239> mon<00:04:15.449> refer<00:04:15.690> to

so<00:05:17.490> many<00:05:17.580> people<00:05:17.880> who<00:05:17.970> just<00:05:18.150> run<00:05:18.390> around<00:05:18.510> with

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
so many people who just run around with

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.110 
so many people who just run around with
really<00:05:19.110> loud<00:05:19.260> footsteps<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.860> don't<00:05:20.070> care<00:05:20.310> and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
really loud footsteps and don't care and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.550 
really loud footsteps and don't care and
I'm<00:05:21.210> usually<00:05:21.419> pretty<00:05:21.660> good<00:05:21.810> at<00:05:21.990> hearing<00:05:22.290> them

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
I'm usually pretty good at hearing them

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.860 
I'm usually pretty good at hearing them
from<00:05:22.860> at<00:05:22.950> least<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.310> short<00:05:23.610> distance<00:05:23.820> away<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.840> i

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
from at least a short distance away so i

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.840 
from at least a short distance away so i
can<00:05:25.080> turn<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:25.410> kill<00:05:25.590> him<00:05:25.740> well<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.669> can't

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
can turn and kill him well you can't

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.770 
can turn and kill him well you can't
really<00:05:26.880> do<00:05:27.090> anything<00:05:27.240> about<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.480> anymore

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
really do anything about that anymore

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.320 
really do anything about that anymore
and<00:05:28.020> lastly<00:05:28.500> i'm<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.950> perks<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.910> perks<00:05:30.180> are

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
and lastly i'm the perks the perks are

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.300 
and lastly i'm the perks the perks are
very<00:05:30.540> well<00:05:30.750> balanced<00:05:31.229> in<00:05:31.320> my<00:05:31.440> opinion<00:05:31.770> there

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
very well balanced in my opinion there

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.950 
very well balanced in my opinion there
isn't<00:05:32.580> like<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.729> stopping<00:05:33.150> power<00:05:33.300> or<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.600> slight

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
isn't like a stopping power or a slight

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.719 
isn't like a stopping power or a slight
of<00:05:34.080> hand<00:05:34.110> or<00:05:34.470> anything<00:05:34.770> like<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:34.950> if<00:05:35.520> you

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729

think and also gives you a little bit
more<00:05:46.500> accuracy<00:05:46.950> so<00:05:47.190> it's<00:05:47.280> kind<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.460> like<00:05:47.550> a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
more accuracy so it's kind of like a

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.760 
more accuracy so it's kind of like a
two-for-one<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.270> it's<00:05:48.990> pretty<00:05:49.110> awesome<00:05:49.290> now

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
two-for-one and it's pretty awesome now

firing<00:05:54.720> seems<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.320> be<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:55.410> little<00:05:55.650> overpowered

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
firing seems to be a little overpowered

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.070 
firing seems to be a little overpowered
people<00:05:56.940> who<00:05:57.060> just<00:05:57.240> slap<00:05:57.450> on<00:05:57.600> the<00:05:57.630> laser<00:05:57.900> on

people who just slap on the laser on
their<00:05:58.200> gun<00:05:58.380> into<00:05:58.530> start<00:05:58.830> hip<00:05:58.979> firing

everywhere<00:05:59.550> they<00:05:59.669> go<00:05:59.700> they<00:06:00.390> can<00:06:00.510> get<00:06:00.630> from

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
everywhere they go they can get from

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.000 
everywhere they go they can get from
hallways<00:06:01.110> from<00:06:01.260> like<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:01.410> hundred<00:06:01.560> feet<00:06:01.770> away

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
hallways from like a hundred feet away

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.800 
hallways from like a hundred feet away
and<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.880> will<00:06:02.910> not<00:06:03.180> beat<00:06:03.450> them<00:06:03.600> if<00:06:03.690> you're

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
and you will not beat them if you're

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.060 
and you will not beat them if you're
aiming<00:06:04.050> down<00:06:04.110> your<00:06:04.260> sights<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.890> some

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
aiming down your sights and in some

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.950 
aiming down your sights and in some
scenarios<00:06:05.220> so<00:06:05.940> that's<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:06.270> little<00:06:06.419> overpowered

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
scenarios so that's a little overpowered

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.230 
scenarios so that's a little overpowered
in<00:06:07.020> my<00:06:07.169> opinion<00:06:07.500> i'm<00:06:07.740> really<00:06:08.400> not<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:08.760> fan<00:06:08.940> of

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
in my opinion i'm really not a fan of

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.080 
in my opinion i'm really not a fan of
hip<00:06:09.600> firing<00:06:09.840> anyway<00:06:10.290> so<00:06:10.370> yeah<00:06:11.370> but<00:06:12.000> i<00:06:12.030> mean

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
hip firing anyway so yeah but i mean

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.640 
hip firing anyway so yeah but i mean
aside<00:06:12.360> from<00:06:12.510> that<00:06:12.720> there's<00:06:13.050> really<00:06:13.350> not<00:06:13.590> too

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
aside from that there's really not too

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.219 
aside from that there's really not too
much<00:06:14.070> i<00:06:14.220> can<00:06:14.340> complain<00:06:14.669> about<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:15.720> jumping<00:06:16.110> is

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
much i can complain about the jumping is

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.740 
much i can complain about the jumping is
quite<00:06:16.440> irritating<00:06:17.010> I<00:06:17.160> suppose<00:06:17.850> there's<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.630> lot

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
quite irritating I suppose there's a lot

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.969 
quite irritating I suppose there's a lot
of<00:06:18.780> people<00:06:18.960> who<00:06:19.080> just<00:06:19.260> go<00:06:19.380> around<00:06:19.500> thinking

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
of people who just go around thinking

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.170 
of people who just go around thinking
that<00:06:20.160> they're<00:06:20.250> playing<00:06:20.490> halo<00:06:20.850> I<00:06:20.880> think<00:06:21.090> it's

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
that they're playing halo I think it's

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.400 
that they're playing halo I think it's
because<00:06:21.240> halo<00:06:21.600> just<00:06:21.810> came<00:06:21.930> out<00:06:22.050> or<00:06:22.169> something

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
because halo just came out or something

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.810 
because halo just came out or something
but<00:06:22.560> they're<00:06:22.950> going<00:06:23.130> around<00:06:23.280> they're<00:06:23.430> jumping

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
but they're going around they're jumping

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.219 
but they're going around they're jumping
every<00:06:23.970> time<00:06:24.000> they<00:06:24.240> see<00:06:24.419> somebody<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:25.169> you're

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
every time they see somebody and you're

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.330 
every time they see somebody and you're
so<00:06:25.350> freaking<00:06:25.590> hard<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.800> shoot<00:06:26.010> them<00:06:26.160> because

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
so freaking hard to shoot them because

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.010 
so freaking hard to shoot them because
they're<00:06:26.460> like<00:06:26.640> halfway<00:06:26.910> up<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.479> jump<00:06:27.840> so<00:06:27.990> high

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
they're like halfway up the jump so high

they're like halfway up the jump so high
