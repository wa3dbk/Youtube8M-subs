magic<00:00:22.450> mech<00:00:22.630> too<00:00:22.930> but<00:00:23.860> it's<00:00:24.310> really<00:00:24.820> cool<00:00:25.090> back

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300

magic mech too but it's really cool back
right<00:00:25.509> here<00:00:25.689> i<00:00:25.719> think<00:00:25.809> we<00:00:25.989> did<00:00:26.079> a<00:00:26.140> really<00:00:26.200> good

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
right here i think we did a really good

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.740 
right here i think we did a really good
job<00:00:26.579> representing<00:00:27.579> this<00:00:27.759> from<00:00:27.969> the<00:00:28.059> show<00:00:28.239> it'd

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
job representing this from the show it'd

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.240 
job representing this from the show it'd
probably<00:00:28.899> be<00:00:29.110> like<00:00:29.259> a<00:00:29.290> thirty<00:00:29.559> dollar<00:00:29.739> set<00:00:30.099> if

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
probably be like a thirty dollar set if

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.310 
probably be like a thirty dollar set if
it<00:00:30.369> was<00:00:30.489> an<00:00:30.610> actual<00:00:30.939> site<00:00:31.149> see<00:00:31.540> include<00:00:32.290> a

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
thing i added with this model is just

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.150 
thing i added with this model is just
basically<00:00:58.570> kind<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:58.989> small<00:00:59.350> shrine<00:00:59.739> for<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
basically kind of small shrine for the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.520 
basically kind of small shrine for the
staff<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.270> elements<00:01:01.780> right<00:01:01.899> here<00:01:02.079> you<00:01:02.200> can<00:01:02.350> see

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
staff of elements right here you can see

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.990 
staff of elements right here you can see
that<00:01:02.680> it's<00:01:02.860> that<00:01:03.070> same<00:01:03.280> one<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.520> came<00:01:03.790> in<00:01:03.910> the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
that it's that same one that came in the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.649 
that it's that same one that came in the
set<00:01:04.210> except<00:01:04.689> we<00:01:05.220> changed<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:07.180> was<00:01:07.390> a

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
set except we changed this it was a

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.270 
set except we changed this it was a
translucent<00:01:08.409> red<00:01:08.530> piece<00:01:08.799> even<00:01:08.979> though<00:01:09.100> was

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
translucent red piece even though was

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.950 
translucent red piece even though was
inaccurate<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.090> weren't<00:01:10.360> really<00:01:10.479> we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
inaccurate so you weren't really we

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.080 
inaccurate so you weren't really we
replaced<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.469> with<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.740> accurate<00:01:12.610> color<00:01:12.850> of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
replaced it with the accurate color of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.060 
replaced it with the accurate color of
translucent<00:01:13.780> blue<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.500> can<00:01:14.620> take<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.799> look<00:01:14.950> at

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
translucent blue you can take a look at

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.200 
translucent blue you can take a look at
this<00:01:15.190> right<00:01:15.340> here<00:01:15.370> it's<00:01:15.580> just<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.760> very<00:01:16.000> simple

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
this right here it's just a very simple

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.880 
this right here it's just a very simple
design<00:01:16.570> there's<00:01:16.840> not<00:01:16.960> really<00:01:17.080> much<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.470> it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
design there's not really much to it it

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.289 
design there's not really much to it it
just<00:01:17.920> be<00:01:18.190> able<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.340> add<00:01:18.610> into<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> psyche

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
just be able to add into the psyche

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.240 
just be able to add into the psyche
little<00:01:19.810> plant<00:01:20.049> up<00:01:20.170> here<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.920> i<00:01:20.950> thought<00:01:21.100> was

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
little plant up here so i thought was

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.630 
little plant up here so i thought was
pretty<00:01:21.310> cool

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
pretty cool

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.219 
pretty cool
add<00:01:21.850> into<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.210> set<00:01:22.450> since<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.870> can<00:01:23.020> put<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
add into the set since you can put the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.539 
add into the set since you can put the
staff<00:01:23.440> on<00:01:23.650> here<00:01:23.920> kind<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.250> make<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.400> little

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
staff on here kind of make a little

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.870 
staff on here kind of make a little
playability<00:01:24.940> feature<00:01:25.270> maybe<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.490> moving<00:01:27.790> up

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
playability feature maybe so moving up

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.399 
playability feature maybe so moving up
to<00:01:28.030> classes<00:01:28.420> earth<00:01:28.600> mech<00:01:28.930> i<00:01:29.080> think<00:01:29.290> this<00:01:29.350> is

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
to classes earth mech i think this is

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.469 
to classes earth mech i think this is
one<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.770> best<00:01:29.979> mechs<00:01:30.310> i<00:01:30.520> me<00:01:31.299> and<00:01:31.420> my

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
one of the best mechs i me and my

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.940 
one of the best mechs i me and my
brother<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.930> made<00:01:32.200> my<00:01:32.530> brother<00:01:32.740> made

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
brother have made my brother made

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.530 
brother have made my brother made
basically<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.490> main<00:01:33.700> frame<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
basically the main frame of it in the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.600 
basically the main frame of it in the
middle<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:35.320> i<00:01:35.500> kind<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.860> extended<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
middle then i kind of extended it on the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
to you can just kind of set them in

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.949 
to you can just kind of set them in
there<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.750> sometimes<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.840> can

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
there like that sometimes you can

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.839 
there like that sometimes you can
actually<00:02:36.049> sit<00:02:36.409> them<00:02:36.530> down<00:02:36.560> up<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.189> don't<00:02:37.700> know

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
actually sit them down up I don't know

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.270 
actually sit them down up I don't know
if<00:02:37.909> he<00:02:38.090> actually<00:02:38.599> do<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.349> time<00:02:39.409> you<00:02:40.159> can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
if he actually do it this time you can

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.770 
if he actually do it this time you can
see<00:02:40.459> how<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.879> can<00:02:41.030> set<00:02:41.239> them<00:02:41.329> down<00:02:41.359> in<00:02:41.659> there

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
see how you can set them down in there

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.479 
see how you can set them down in there
as<00:02:41.930> well<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.799> there's<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.010> couple<00:02:43.129> different

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
as well so there's a couple different

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.559 
as well so there's a couple different
ways<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.700> can<00:02:43.819> put<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.120> there<00:02:44.239> there's<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
ways you can put them in there there's a

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.849 
ways you can put them in there there's a
way<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> stand<00:02:45.079> them<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.290> at<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.470> bottom<00:02:45.769> but

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
way to stand them up at the bottom but

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.140 
way to stand them up at the bottom but
it's<00:02:46.040> kind<00:02:46.189> of<00:02:46.220> hard<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> get<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.819> when<00:02:47.030> you're

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's kind of hard to get to when you're

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.819 
it's kind of hard to get to when you're
you<00:02:47.450> know<00:02:47.480> doing<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.109> camera<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.590> most<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
you know doing it on camera on most the

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.800 
you know doing it on camera on most the
time<00:02:49.069> you'll<00:02:49.549> end<00:02:49.670> up<00:02:49.700> screwing<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.209> screwing

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
time you'll end up screwing up screwing

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.360 
time you'll end up screwing up screwing
it<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.049> if<00:02:51.230> you're<00:02:51.319> on<00:02:51.349> camera<00:02:51.769> but<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.280> can

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it up if you're on camera but you can

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.220 
it up if you're on camera but you can
see<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.000> legs<00:02:53.420> are<00:02:53.599> here<00:02:53.810> are<00:02:53.900> some<00:02:54.049> cool

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
detailed but they're just kind of made

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.309 
detailed but they're just kind of made
for<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.180> being<00:03:05.359> able<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.659> whack<00:03:05.900> it's<00:03:06.109> tough

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
for like being able to whack it's tough

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.259 
for like being able to whack it's tough
being<00:03:06.500> able<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.769> fight<00:03:07.099> things<00:03:07.400> definitely<00:03:08.239> a

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
being able to fight things definitely a

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.729 
being able to fight things definitely a
cool<00:03:08.420> looking<00:03:08.689> mech<00:03:08.900> right<00:03:09.079> here<00:03:09.260> though<00:03:09.709> I

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
cool looking mech right here though I

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.199 
cool looking mech right here though I
think<00:03:10.069> there's<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> lot<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.489> details<00:03:10.879> on<00:03:11.030> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
think there's a lot of details on it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.089 
think there's a lot of details on it
these<00:03:11.659> arms<00:03:12.079> just<00:03:12.349> kind<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.560> move<00:03:12.709> back<00:03:12.920> and

these arms just kind of move back and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.619 
these arms just kind of move back and
forth<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.639> they're<00:03:13.939> kind<00:03:14.389> of<00:03:14.420> just

forth like this they're kind of just

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.059 
forth like this they're kind of just
meant<00:03:14.810> for<00:03:14.959> show<00:03:15.170> obviously<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.709> can<00:03:15.859> use

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
meant for show obviously you can use

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.679 
meant for show obviously you can use
them<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.340> hit<00:03:16.489> stuff<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.269> they're<00:03:17.389> not<00:03:17.510> really

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
them to hit stuff but they're not really

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.720

meant<00:03:17.900> for<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.260> huge<00:03:18.709> use<00:03:19.189> of<00:03:19.370> playability

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
meant for the huge use of playability

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.640 
meant for the huge use of playability
definitely<00:03:20.689> has<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> lot<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.049> details<00:03:21.409> on<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
definitely has a lot of details on this

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.780 
definitely has a lot of details on this
model<00:03:21.950> though<00:03:22.040> that's<00:03:22.220> one<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.519> things<00:03:22.670> I

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
really like probably said that a bunch

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.099 
really like probably said that a bunch
of<00:03:26.060> times<00:03:26.239> now<00:03:26.389> but<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.569> can<00:03:26.689> see<00:03:26.840> how<00:03:26.930> that

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
of times now but you can see how that

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.039 
of times now but you can see how that
lifts<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:27.709> oops<00:03:28.129> down<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.840> turning<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:29.989> around

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
lifts up oops down and turning it around

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.020 
lifts up oops down and turning it around
to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.349> side<00:03:30.590> looks<00:03:30.859> very<00:03:31.040> cool<00:03:31.220> as<00:03:31.340> well<00:03:31.519> we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.309 
to the side looks very cool as well we
could<00:03:32.150> add<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.329> couple<00:03:32.510> details<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.169> back

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
could add a couple details on the back

came<00:03:39.829> up<00:03:39.949> with<00:03:40.069> this<00:03:40.190> kind<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.549> design<00:03:40.970> right

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
came up with this kind of design right

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.819 
came up with this kind of design right
here<00:03:41.449> with<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.690> eyes<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:41.989> stuff<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.709> going

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.259 
here with the eyes and stuff and going
outward<00:03:43.280> definitely<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> really<00:03:44.180> good

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
outward definitely a really good

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.300 
outward definitely a really good
designed<00:03:44.659> by<00:03:44.810> him<00:03:45.049> right<00:03:45.260> there

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
designed by him right there

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.890 
designed by him right there
so<00:03:46.669> that<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.239> did<00:03:47.359> a<00:03:47.419> pretty<00:03:47.690> good<00:03:47.840> job

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
so that I think we did a pretty good job

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720 
so that I think we did a pretty good job
making<00:03:48.349> this<00:03:48.560> back<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.010> show<00:03:49.190> obviously

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
making this back from the show obviously

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.729 
making this back from the show obviously
it<00:03:49.819> wasn't<00:03:50.150> in<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.419> huge<00:03:51.109> amount<00:03:51.169> of<00:03:51.440> time<00:03:51.620> in

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
it wasn't in a huge amount of time in

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.140 
it wasn't in a huge amount of time in
the<00:03:51.799> show<00:03:51.949> it's<00:03:52.280> kind<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.489> just<00:03:52.609> a<00:03:52.790> small

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
the show it's kind of just a small

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.960 
the show it's kind of just a small
little<00:03:53.930> battle<00:03:54.260> scene<00:03:54.500> between<00:03:55.040> J<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.370> Klaus

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
little battle scene between J and Klaus

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.229 
little battle scene between J and Klaus
but<00:03:56.209> definitely<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.659> sweet<00:03:56.870> Mack<00:03:58.090> alright<00:03:59.090> guys

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
but definitely a sweet Mack alright guys

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.759 
but definitely a sweet Mack alright guys
so<00:03:59.389> that<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.629> basically<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.109> for<00:04:00.229> this<00:04:00.530> Mach

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
so that is basically it for this Mach

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.500 
so that is basically it for this Mach
it's<00:04:01.010> kind<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.310> smaller<00:04:01.790> Mach<00:04:02.209> for<00:04:02.479> a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
it's kind of a smaller Mach for a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.300 
it's kind of a smaller Mach for a
Ninjago<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.109> definitely<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.500> cool<00:04:03.769> one<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.190> my

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
Ninjago but definitely a cool one in my

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.780 
Ninjago but definitely a cool one in my
opinion<00:04:04.729> this<00:04:05.479> is<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.629> highly<00:04:06.019> suggested<00:04:06.829> Mach

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
opinion this is a highly suggested Mach

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.729 
opinion this is a highly suggested Mach
night<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.780> people<00:04:09.049> wanted<00:04:09.260> me<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.349> make<00:04:09.500> from

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
night that people wanted me to make from

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.530 
night that people wanted me to make from
Ninjago<00:04:10.099> obviously<00:04:10.849> there<00:04:11.030> will<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.269> other

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
Ninjago obviously there will be other

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.780 
Ninjago obviously there will be other
ones<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.930> come<00:04:12.049> out<00:04:12.169> soon<00:04:12.530> highly<00:04:13.010> suggested

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
ones to come out soon highly suggested

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.349 
ones to come out soon highly suggested
ones<00:04:14.139> one<00:04:15.139> suggestion<00:04:16.039> that<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.400> am<00:04:16.669> denying<00:04:17.120> is

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
ones one suggestion that I am denying is

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.110 
ones one suggestion that I am denying is
the<00:04:17.510> preeminent<00:04:18.159> due<00:04:19.159> to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> fact<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.940> its

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
the preeminent due to the fact of its

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.210 
the preeminent due to the fact of its
size<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.840> could<00:04:20.900> maybe<00:04:21.440> make<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.769> smaller

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
size I could maybe make a smaller

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.420 
size I could maybe make a smaller
version<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.150> by<00:04:23.780> honestly<00:04:24.680> making<00:04:24.919> that<00:04:25.250> I

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
version of it by honestly making that I

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.430 
version of it by honestly making that I
mean<00:04:25.639> Chen<00:04:26.150> steamboats<00:04:26.659> one<00:04:26.990> thing<00:04:27.260> but

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
mean Chen steamboats one thing but

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.930 
mean Chen steamboats one thing but
that's<00:04:27.620> kind<00:04:27.949> of<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.130> whole<00:04:28.310> nother<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.849> I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
that's kind of a whole nother and I

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.310 
that's kind of a whole nother and I
really<00:04:29.300> don't<00:04:29.389> have<00:04:29.539> enough<00:04:29.750> pieces<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.199> make

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
really don't have enough pieces to make

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.350 
really don't have enough pieces to make
something<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:32.000> I'm<00:04:32.180> honestly

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
something like that so I'm honestly

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.330 
something like that so I'm honestly
gonna<00:04:32.779> deny<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.320> one<00:04:33.469> for<00:04:33.710> now<00:04:33.830> unless

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
gonna deny that one for now unless

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.850 
gonna deny that one for now unless
something<00:04:35.090> happens<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.659> future

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
something happens in the future

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.920 
something happens in the future
and<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.550> end<00:04:37.940> up<00:04:38.060> deciding<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.599> make<00:04:38.720> it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
and I do end up deciding to make it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.170 
and I do end up deciding to make it
obviously<00:04:39.349> but<00:04:39.560> for<00:04:39.620> now<00:04:39.889> it's<00:04:40.430> not<00:04:40.759> probably

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
obviously but for now it's not probably

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.420 
obviously but for now it's not probably
gonna<00:04:41.270> happen<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.590> definitely<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:43.160> cool

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
gonna happen but it is definitely a cool

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.670 
gonna happen but it is definitely a cool
thing<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:43.759> would<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.780> would<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.080> cool<00:04:45.319> set

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
thing that would it would be a cool set

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.869 
thing that would it would be a cool set
um<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.270> don't<00:04:47.479> really<00:04:47.629> know<00:04:47.810> how<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.169> would

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
um but I don't really know how you would

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.999 
um but I don't really know how you would
exactly<00:04:49.879> design<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.569> you<00:04:50.990> know<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.139> think<00:04:51.590> you

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
exactly design it you know I think you

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.439 
exactly design it you know I think you
guys<00:04:52.129> kind<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.400> get<00:04:52.520> what<00:04:52.580> I'm<00:04:52.669> saying<00:04:52.909> but<00:04:53.389> I

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
guys kind of get what I'm saying but I

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:54.969

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
thought that was this was a pretty cool

thing<00:04:56.479> to<00:04:56.690> make<00:04:56.810> from<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.050> show<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.500> kind<00:04:57.710> of

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
thing to make from the show and kind of

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.850 
thing to make from the show and kind of
a<00:04:57.830> smaller<00:04:58.419> not<00:04:59.419> really<00:04:59.659> recognized<00:05:00.229> mock<00:05:00.560> um

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
that people have made so far I saw a

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.390 
that people have made so far I saw a
couple<00:05:03.470> people<00:05:03.620> make<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:03.949> mock<00:05:04.159> and<00:05:04.310> they
