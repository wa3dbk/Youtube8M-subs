00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
feel about the serving situation let's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.570 
feel about the serving situation let's
assume<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> instead<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.310> instead<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
assume that instead of the instead of a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.820 
assume that instead of the instead of a
teacher<00:01:33.120> who<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.420> who<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.230> trying<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.620> preach

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
teacher who is who is trying to preach

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.220 
teacher who is who is trying to preach
the<00:01:35.040> ideas<00:01:35.370> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.550> Bible<00:01:35.960> instead<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.080> that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
the ideas in the Bible instead of that

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.170 
the ideas in the Bible instead of that
let's<00:01:37.620> say<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.580> was<00:01:38.670> another<00:01:38.880> teacher

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
let's say that it was another teacher

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.340 
let's say that it was another teacher
who<00:01:39.300> was<00:01:39.540> trying<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.310> teach<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> Quran<00:01:42.350> what

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
who was trying to teach the Quran what

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
who was trying to teach the Quran what
would<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
would you think about that and do you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.070 
would you think about that and do you
think<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.390> accept<00:01:45.840> no

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
think that that would be just accept no

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050 
think that that would be just accept no
I<00:01:46.110> mean<00:01:46.320> obviously<00:01:46.830> we're<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.940> firm

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
I mean obviously we're a pretty firm

boats<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.290> mean<00:02:18.410> we're<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.890> river<00:02:19.040> Bay

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
boats I mean we're just at the river Bay

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.500 
boats I mean we're just at the river Bay
their<00:02:19.489> boats<00:02:19.670> there<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.120> say<00:02:20.239> but<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.420> could

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
their boats there they say but it could

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
their boats there they say but it could
fit<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.690> dinosaur<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.200> those<00:02:21.410> boats<00:02:21.620> okay<00:02:22.099> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
fit a dinosaur on those boats okay I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.830 
fit a dinosaur on those boats okay I
don't<00:02:22.549> think<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> things<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.480> good<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
don't think the things so good the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.509 
don't think the things so good the
dimensions<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> boat<00:02:24.799> were<00:02:24.980> specifically

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
dimensions of the boat were specifically

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.150 
dimensions of the boat were specifically
discussed<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> Bible<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.920> they

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
discussed in the in the Bible and they

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.830 
discussed in the in the Bible and they
were<00:02:28.220> well<00:02:28.700> they<00:02:28.730> were<00:02:28.879> considerably<00:02:29.420> smaller

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
were well they were considerably smaller

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.690 
were well they were considerably smaller
and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.650> think<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.010> would<00:02:31.099> be<00:02:31.220> very<00:02:31.489> very

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and I think it would be very very

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.640 
and I think it would be very very
difficult<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.920> somebody<00:02:33.920> who<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.220> think<00:02:35.650> 600

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
difficult for somebody who I think 600

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.580 
difficult for somebody who I think 600
said<00:02:37.030> he<00:02:38.030> was<00:02:38.180> an<00:02:38.299> old<00:02:38.450> man<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.810> very<00:02:39.200> old<00:02:39.349> I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
said he was an old man it's very old I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.130 
said he was an old man it's very old I
think<00:02:39.829> he<00:02:40.220> was<00:02:40.400> its<00:02:40.819> evolution<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.720> scientific

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
think he was its evolution is scientific

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
think he was its evolution is scientific
it's<00:02:42.590> something<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.299> is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it's something that that is that is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.850 
it's something that that is that is
truly<00:02:44.870> important<00:02:45.349> it's<00:02:45.470> something<00:02:45.560> that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
truly important it's something that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.369 
truly important it's something that
should<00:02:46.129> be<00:02:46.160> talking<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.670> us<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.230> evolution<00:02:48.230> is

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
should be talking to us but evolution is

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.500 
should be talking to us but evolution is
not<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:49.069> has<00:02:49.190> nothing<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.549> do<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.299> any
