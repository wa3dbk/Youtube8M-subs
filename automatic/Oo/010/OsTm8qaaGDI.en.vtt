00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.910
 If you are not alone you should be a surprise where my wife is 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.510
 Uh ... 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.510
 He attacked just fine and allocated what great conferences and on 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.890
 Uh ... Being a talkative host I would like to think I know a lot 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800
 Uh ... but I've already done 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.739
 I really learned the time of the day I think this was incredible it was earlier but we did 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.919
 To continue this guys this team oh ... I'm thrilled to hear more 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.300
 About Wadhi 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.829
 Uh ... the situation that you're screaming about is a republic that uses Grady here for everyone 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.910
 Talk about it 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 I think United citizens 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 The shooting was mainly on a losing horse 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.170
 I think a lot of shot the horse in the first place 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.350
 So uh ... it's good to see that 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 People recognize the fact that companies give uh these ... 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.850
 Speech rights are able to contribute to a large-scale policy is what caused 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 The problem is in the first place 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.470
 Uh ... I think a lot of different ways to solve those amendments was obvious 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.679
 Discuss this 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.549
 Summarize that they were discussing shareholder rights and giving them 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.730
 More power 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.970
 So they can determine what uh ... political spending companies there only 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.080
 Was addressed in 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.610
 More should be discussed here. We will talk about legislative solutions 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.890
 There are some legislative proposals as well as awesome and I just want to say 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.680
 Uh ... that from 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 My point really fast is the mention on 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 This is because our FCP II happens to think that the constitutional amendment 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390
 Very necessary 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.870
 Uh ... there are two things that do not modify 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 An intense legal personality and no public funding for the elections 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.530
 Now I understand some of the speakers and others that I have 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.990
 I researched with a person who was quite outgoing and adjusting my businesses 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 It says either it does not have constitutional rights 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.450
 Is a bit of a nuclear option 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.530
 George says 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.090
 The 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.180
 Now that is not to exclude other ideas, whether liberal 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.319
 Liberalism is conservative ideas 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.509
 I love to have a convention and that's what we pay for 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.389
 Where uh ... and everyone get a suggestion 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.249
 There are different ways to end corruption 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.959
 Sosa technology convention and corruption that I think the vast majority of like 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.499
 Country can get behind 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.169
 That is why I am also very optimistic about these legislative solutions 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.979
 Because there is one thing that these country greases have divided 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.849
 It is that by our politics the money is damaged 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 Professor Yessig has shown you seventy-five percent 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.469
 Uh ... of Americans believe that this is the case I saw referenda of course that 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.359
 They entered the range of 84 percent 85 as well as all that we 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.499
 agree 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.519
 It looks like an incredibly tough battle 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.489
 No matter how you go oh ... MSN just let me give you a quick sense of 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.090
 The 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 The problem was mentioned to the solution 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.489
 Uh ... I thought it was too deep 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.879
 That we have 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.139
 In fact 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.339
 Our democratic loss 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.619
 and now after 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.510
 To a person who is not familiar with all the details of who 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.319
 It may sound a bit harsh 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.469
 Is not really harsh when the 90 percent three time in Congress with the person 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.559
 More money when choosing 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.669
 Now what remains unsettled is whether this person is a Republican or a Democrat 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.530
 What remains unresolved is whether they are liberal or conservative 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.569
 The remainder is not settled any of their ideas or ideology 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.659
 What is the most Internet 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.479
 Is how much money they have if they have more money 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.049
 They won the election 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.060
 So you tell me what to choose from votes as a democratic state 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.599
 Money words 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.930
 And I think that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.719
 All most Americans know that in their bones 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.579
 Call Republicans capitulation capitalism 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.550
 We call corruption in companies 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.339
 But this same thing with different names 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.289
 And so got it 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.969
 For example again that on the list was published press and grew up this morning 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.909
 Climate change there was just a survey done 67 percent science 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.269
 Of the american said 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.999
 Politicians need to do something about climate change with the need to take 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.689
 Legislative work 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.350
 Said every 20 e five percent do not do not do anything 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.459
 We have an effective democracy 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.179
 There will also be no measures to do so 

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:30.039
 But in fact there is no 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.340
 Not just from the Republican candidate who boasts about how his energy policies are 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.560
 Written by coal power oil companies 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.409
 But by the Democratic candidate 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.899
 Incidentally also the most important people that profit more than this 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.560
 A corrupt system 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 TV stations 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.300
 Where all this money goes 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.199
 In big big already very close to ads t_v_ 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.149
 Are you surprised that there are no questions? 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:05.939
 On corruption in any of the discussions 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.199
 There were no questions about climate change there were no questions 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.569
 In any case appeal 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.680
 Corporate governance 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.040
 That will raise this money 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.189
 And then handed to those companies t_v_ the same 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.740
 We have no functioning democracy and that is why we lose on climate change 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.690
 even though 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.020
 The vast majority of the American people are with us 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.530
 The American people believe the vast majority of re-making associations should not be 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.620
 Cut back under any circumstances 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.899
 In the seventies eighties high 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.230
 Great cause 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.189
 Never be discussed in democracy 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.080
 Which a politician has the right to consider 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.840
 They thought they were 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.379
 The voters will sign on to proceed with the election and propose what 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.499
 Eighty-two percent of the world's two countries are deployed 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.360
 She did not 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.990
 We had a democracy 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.679
 If the boys think that was more important but not 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:59.610
 What matters most with this election term is more than anything else 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.919
 About ninety three percent of the time 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.499
 He who has more money 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.600
 we have to 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.029
 We should 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.419
 Change this system 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.389
 In order to save our democracy 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.960
 As now he told me there are many different ways to get rid of some knowledge 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.360
 Those on the plate today 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.430
 But I'll leave you a note of optimism 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.439
 For my credit here 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.249
 That is 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.950
 We've got at least 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.369
 3 ropes country in our favor message 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.160
 Three quarters of the country 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.620
 The long-term 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.889
 You will not lose 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.490
 We are going to wear 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.539
 Although all this matter is 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.570
 when and how 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.069
 That seventy-five percent is a country 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.330
 He is dying for a car 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.380
 To clean up this corruption 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.330
 There is a waiting for someone 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.169
 Or make a decision somewhere to say 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.650
 Here is how you can do it 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.770
 Here's how 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.950
 Now force your back you take it back from the people that you spend on 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.580
 money 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.520
 To buy politicians and your own by your government 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.940
 Here is what they did not mention when they saw that 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.250
 Yeah hell 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.189
 To liberals and conservatives say they will sell and liberties u_s_a_ 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.550
 I knew people were worried about what was happening in the agreement 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.190
 Three quarters of the States have ratified any amendment whatsoever 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.009
 It occurs in a connection 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.459
 The only thing that three ropes the country is agreeing to 

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:24.889
 Money may damage our policies and we will work to put an end to them
