world dr. Parviz and his team are still
in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:09.510> early<00:00:10.080> stages<00:00:10.110> but<00:00:10.679> they've

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
in the very early stages but they've

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.789 
in the very early stages but they've
made<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> first<00:00:11.910> steps<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:13.049> example<00:00:13.500> has

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
made the first steps this example has

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.849 
made the first steps this example has
one<00:00:14.070> pixel<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.700> small<00:00:15.299> blue<00:00:15.599> dot<00:00:15.839> powered<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
one pixel a small blue dot powered and

one pixel a small blue dot powered and
controlled<00:00:16.920> by<00:00:17.520> radio<00:00:17.730> waves<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.480> the

essentially<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:24.119> pixel<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> contact

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
essentially is one pixel on a contact

research that is currently going on in

research that is currently going on in
labs<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.829> dr.<00:02:05.159> Parviz<00:02:05.520> --is<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.259> blue

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
labs like dr. Parviz --is so if one blue

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.369 
labs like dr. Parviz --is so if one blue
pixel<00:02:08.009> could<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.369> day<00:02:08.550> lead<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:09.090> many<00:02:09.379> what

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
pixel could one day lead to many what

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960

might<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> world<00:02:10.979> look<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
might the world look like the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
might the world look like the
and<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.210> computer<00:02:12.690> screen<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.170> your<00:02:13.350> eye<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:14.730> can

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and a computer screen in your eye we can

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.270 
and a computer screen in your eye we can
only<00:02:15.000> speculate<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:16.050> perhaps<00:02:16.280> something

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
only speculate but perhaps something

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.240 
only speculate but perhaps something
like<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:21.320> information<00:02:22.320> from<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> web<00:02:22.770> could

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
like this information from the web could

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.160 
like this information from the web could
be<00:02:23.370> layered<00:02:23.610> onto<00:02:23.910> almost<00:02:24.150> anything<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.990> look

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
be layered onto almost anything we look

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.090 
be layered onto almost anything we look
at<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:27.750> will<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.230> up<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> smart<00:02:28.920> lens

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
at it will then be up to the smart lens

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.790 
at it will then be up to the smart lens
users<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.970> future<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.810> determine<00:02:31.290> what<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
users of the future to determine what is
