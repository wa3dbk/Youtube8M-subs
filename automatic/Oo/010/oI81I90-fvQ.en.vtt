00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.430
 mathematics axis thematic numbers and 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.530
 proportionality 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.630
 we will see how to add or subtract fractions and 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.860
 mixed numbers maybe we will 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.900
 helped with diagrams 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 we want to add one fifth plus two fifths 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.379
 so we will see how to make 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 one-fifth diagram and the diagram 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 two fifths and we'll see the result for 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.820
 the diagram of a fifth what we will do 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.610
 will be to divide an integer into five parts 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 because in five parts because the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 denominator tells us in how many parts 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.809
 five parts and how many parts we painted 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 tells us the numerator is to say the number 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.630
 of rivers 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.300
 this is the diagram of a fifth 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.220
 and that we want to add two fifths and the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 two fifths diagram following the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.110
 same logic is an integer divided into 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.150
 five parts that has two parts 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 painted 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.260
 and therefore the result is going to be a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.880
 whole also divided into five parts 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.880
 with beads painted parts 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 1 2 and 3 that is the result that is 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.190
 we divide the whole into 5 parts and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.280
 we paint accounts 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.500
 3 the result of a fifth plus two 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 fifths are three fifths 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.400
 let's see another example we want to add two 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.490
 thirds plus one third plus two thirds 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.290
 the two-thirds diagram is a whole 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.160
 divided into three parts of which 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.050
 they painted two the diagram of a third is 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.620
 an integer divided into three parts of the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 which one is painted and the two diagram 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.790
 thirds is the same as the first 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 then it is an integer divided into three 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.530
 parts of which two are painted and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.170
 we want to add but this time if we 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
 we fix we have five painted parts and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 we are dividing the integers in 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.410
 three parts therefore the result is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 the one that is here five painted parts 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.270
 in two integers divided into three parts 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.240
 therefore the result is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.100
 we divide the whole into three parts but 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.509
 of those we have five graffiti 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.620
 five thirds 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.830
 If we look 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.790
 the denominator below is the same and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 up in the sum of two plus one plus two 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.080
 but this we can write it as 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.319
 mixed number and that mixed number would be 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.430
 like this number that is entirely 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:34.000
 painted that is an integer and how many 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.560
 over two thirds there are two thirds left over so 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.349
 so much to write this as number 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.830
 mixed is written an integer with two 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.430
 thirds 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.129
 let's make a following example 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 we want to be mixed numbers two 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.260
 whole three quarters minus a whole one 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.000
 fourth two whole three fourths 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.950
 schematizes as well as 12 whole parts and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.200
 an entire part divided in four of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.969
 which three are painted two between 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.299
 the three quarters are already wanted 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:07.180
 subtract an integer a quarter a part 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.660
 whole with a whole with a single room 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.450
 painted 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:19.370
 if you look at two whole three quarters 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:21.500
 We have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 parts 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.550
 painted and those 11 we have to 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.170
 subtract 1 2 3 4 5 parts painted by 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.170
 so how many painted parts are going 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.990
 to stay we are going to be 6 is to say 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.270
 we have integers divided into 4 parts of 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.270
 which have to be painted 6 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.380
 Murcia 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.150
 six quarters but six quarters we have 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.040
 than writing it as a mixed number if we 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.700
 we fix here there are 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.109
 an integer and here we have two parts of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.560
 four two quarters 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.370
 that's the writing as a mixed number a 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.319
 whole two rooms 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.450
 remember that the fractions are going to 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.159
 try to simplify when you can and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.610
 if you look here we can simplify 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.340
 this fraction by 2 and this is 2 and 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.800
 1 the equivalent of an integer 2 quarts 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.980
 it is a whole a mail 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.760
 this is the result of that subtraction of 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.760
 numbers themselves
