00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.140

 Outside of replacing moon 4 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.670
 Yup 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.780
 Tonnage excluding annual production 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.860
 ni 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.900
 ben 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.900
 ben 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
 Hmm 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 Hmm 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620
 Hmm 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.839
 Follow 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 What's the feeling now I am playing in a 16-beat on it there is an erect red 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.900
 No 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.650
 N N p 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 Nana 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.030
 Follow 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.920
 When this enters the 7th of domination of the pattern 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 Yup 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.630
 Hm 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:29.090
 Here N Jar Jar also I'd say 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.200
 I will sometimes say selling jar jar of it of course that you can buy Chau left 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.540
 Pow Te Tsu Koubakon with the right hand 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.540
 I will try to use my right hand 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 Hmm 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.500
 Slowly after 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.390
 The better is the Tteyuu something music of glue by things to do in the wind that say 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.330
 Don't do it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.080
 ben 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 Boone 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.310
 Alto 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 Yeah N 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.220
 Yup 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:20.840
 There's a little small tip like this at this place 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:23.480
 In the number of down-up of which in turn Te and really 16 beats and look over become 8 beats true 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.340
 It does not change, but 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 The direction of picking does not change with down down down bullets , though 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.530
 I say this is a little law change 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.020
 N N p 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.890
 N Bean 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.400
 N bea 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 I will be happy 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:03.300
 I say break even it easy I'm the number of brushing is changed 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:07.100
 It was Kore when it was 16 and this time when it became 8 beat this time 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.100
 For example of this 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:16.159
 For example, when you first pull this on a folk guitar , for example 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:25.569
 I feel slow to put down 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:25.569
 Now for the bitter half turned to the speed at which the right hand is halved 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.430
 It is because the play also in the marriage speed 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.300
 De deen 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.300
 Follow 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.300
 Hmm 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.180
 Yeah N 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 Hmm 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.170
 Hmm 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.800
 Well yeah 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.800
 It's ah 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:07.520
 Down up is the opposite even if it is reversed 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.120
 It 's better to have a feeling that you can play both ways somehow 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.980
 Oh dear 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:17.030
 Even if it says 8 beats, it will play with just 16 beats down 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:22.650
 Or a play the 8 beat the Tteyuu continue to swing away the up 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:26.639
 Folk song one step 9-8 beats is half of 16 beats 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.540
 That is going to the up and down me at speed 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.020
 8 of Tteyuu song beat it is not givin in two ways 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.020
 Right hand 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.530
 Happiness ho 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:54.840
 In the book of Maa , this is a music score 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:05:00.570
 The is written in 51 pages how I found the following 50 pages are selling will is written 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.190
 Take a phrase that goes like this in a place like this 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.200
 First of all 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.400
 It is a practice method 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:14.139
 What and what 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.280
 To understand the included have what is there is a good trick better through the 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.129
 Once you understand it and you can play it to some extent 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:25.169
 Let's go ahead 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:29.009
 It is better to be able to play without thinking so much, so for example now you are playing 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:39.169
 I'm pulling only four of them 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:41.979
 UU de that so also would sometimes become want to go even 6 yen as their own songs 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.979
 Yup 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.810
 With thumb 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.900
 It is more freedom to hold the 8th fret with your thumb 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:56.330
 For example, while that freedom has increased 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.310
 If there is a music score called a rhythm score, then that time 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.660
 In most cases, you get stuck 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:09.300
 It is why is there because not written music is left to yourself as far as brushing 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:18.210
 Among the 12 animals we have to be freed to a certain extent and we have to be responsible 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:25.139
 It is important that heavy snow etc. ride the feeling that Komaru is rolling 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:27.210
 For example, if it is good thing, I have to write it as it is written in my book, my book. 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:33.889
 It does not mean that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.889
 Kokkara Learn voodoo of it in enough a free how to play 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.200
 Hmm 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:54.539
 pou dou dou 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.539
 5 minutes 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:12.950
 Has entered 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:17.450
 I Nzai 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:23.840
 Well as good or bad as playing now 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:28.100
 In the convenience store impassable on the stage seriously there to seriously with it going to freely wait inflatable 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:31.150
 The atmosphere is a little different, but if it is recording, this is how serious 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.150
 What this in Fu 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.470
 Hmm 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.870
 Hm 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.870
 No' minute 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.940
 It's something like an imme once, but it's still a bit on the stage 

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.940
 Dolly 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:07.610
 Boo Boo said 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.610
