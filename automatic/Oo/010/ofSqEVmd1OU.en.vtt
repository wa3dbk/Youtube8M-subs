00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.410
 inch laptop my share intel celeron 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.550
 processor and 4 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.870

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.730
 things they for example office and 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.350
 internet to moderate photo editing 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.970
 the breaking of all kinds 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.140
 multimedia and playing simple 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.340
 games 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.510
 if first has to go to material 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.490
 we see that in the top 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.050
 danger poets of a black plastic 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.190
 a circular grooves things that you see 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.420
 maybe not very good with that you can 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.619
 hear it 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.330
 and at the bottom you are made of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.529
 the same material but then whatever 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.789
 You see that the battery is not replaceable 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.109
 is of course nice to have 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.749
 know 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.940
 it is 2.3 and 50 centimeters thick and 2.2 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.429
 kilo is not very special but something 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.989
 less suitable for use on the road 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.789
 if i just an A4 sheet at the screen you 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:48.100
 you see how big that 15.6 inch approximately 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.479
 is that put on the edge you see he just 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.739
 a little further on the side spout but 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.209
 just a little more to high will be a4 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.799
 but give a lot in the clean 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:55.629
 space to work 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.549
 the screen that is in it is glossy 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.019
 hd-ready touchscreen and that works 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.309
 naturally super rare with windows 8 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.319
 since the real is meant for the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.429
 operates with your fingers and that shines the 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.989
 fencing it makes it real 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.610
 very nice full bright colors 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.990
 produces a little more trouble 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.120
 of reflection than, for example, an anti 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.230
 glare screen at the top of it 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.090
 we find approaching screen webcam 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.290
 of course very nice for example 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.460
 skype 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.170
 on the side of a keyboard and 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.690
 a numeric part and he has one 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.760
