00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 amazon tablet 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.940
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.980
 androidworld.it this is amazon kindle 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.849
 fire and cdx 8.9 I made a good mix between 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.860
 Italian English 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.599
 we have already reviewed the 7 version 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.400
 inch you see it has no indications 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.040
 on the screen size in the name 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.719
 however however the 8 inch version 9 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.130
 some specific techniques we find here 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.320
 under 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.870
 obviously wifi connectivity no 3g 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.620
 16 gigabytes of internal memory the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.440
 processor is a snapdragon 400 therefore 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.960
 2.2 GHz Dolby Quadcore Audio 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.429
 front camera and compared to the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.969
 7 inch version we also have one 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:56.079
 8 megapixel rear camera that 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:04.260
 also records video at 1080p 2gb of ram 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 add bluetooth wifi missing the gps nfc 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.560
 I'm going to open the package 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.729
 here it is, this is the tablet and the e 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.100
 I put 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.579
 on the one hand we have here even a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.630
 manual what ever happened for a tablet 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.530
 of amazon 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.570
 we then have the micro s ii usb cable very much 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.939
 very long exactly like the version 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.649
 at seven amazon did it for 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.549
 allow users to continue to 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.289
 use it 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.500
 while in office while in office e 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.479
 this and the power supply that I think is not 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.210
 have indications on the workers not 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.350
 must have maximum strength ok from a 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.119
 tree 8 so this is the package 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.770
 of the kindle fire hdx 8 inch and 9 va 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.850
 to breed the pack from 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.530
 shot shots outside and tablet from 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.469
 then the impressive thing is the first 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.219
 what you notice is that it really is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.250
 gossamer 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.410
 besides the fact that it is already on is 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.840
 really very thin and very light 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 impressive the design is the same as the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.750
 7 inch tablet so we have button 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.530
 ignition budget is of the volume in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 in this case we have the camera 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.600
 led flash the double speaker and then 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.180
 obviously in front of the 8 screen 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.700
 inches and 9 with the front camera 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.130
 this tablet is this kindle fire hdx 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.370
 8.9 will be reviewed in the coming days 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.450

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.800
 went to our forum 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 there is a section dedicated precisely to 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.390
 this tablet inside you will also find a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.370
 topic where to ask us questions about the device 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.569
