00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.510
 dear forum friends 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.499
 this one of the technologically advanced equipment 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.499
 who used to stabilize mine 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.139
 it's very easy 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.919
 a fridge compressor 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.730
 some agreements 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.619
 including 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.699
 this 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 which is a small valve that you need to be able to download 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.119
 the plant is high 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 little of the jar not wanting than ever 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.600
 this was lanyard 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.880
 conical 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 to attach the copper tube 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.330
 to the whole series of stories given eighth 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.480
 inch 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.150
 this 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.960
 from another balcony 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.420
 which serves to measure the pressure but in reality 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.390
 it's not that they are that much 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.120
 it would only be to understand if there are losses in the plant then at the end 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.770
 has a switch 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.230
 all security channels 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.440
 and then ce 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 barter tube 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.760
 peter tin 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.850
 don't mind hahaha what is written because mendacious 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 there is a solution of harsh words 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.610
 at 10% 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.840
 10% about 5 I didn't like angels engagement 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.830
 it turns on 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.510
 stock 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.790
 and compressor you start pumping 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 makes it very soon 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.340
 then I saw that when I arrive around 0 a - 0 8 hours something and small change 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 so much to see that the wood begins clear smboli 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 here we are 0 8 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.150
 here 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.329
 now this point is zero red water 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.970
 Professor can also be pushed so hard 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.970
 acetone and boils then + close this 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.930
 pressure cannot be reached 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 then the compressor switches off 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.469
 turned off 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.119
 continuous album glass sign that 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.929
 the air comes out of the clouds 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.009
 what's inside a piece of you that I need for a kitchen knife 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.999
 Darmanitan 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.059
 for bass 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.859
 pendo I didn't check for a compressor on a compressor because 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.210
 I saw what it was 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.709
 its operation 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 everything is there 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.219
 hey how to disassemble 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.479
 if I turn it on 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.809
 because if the bossu pro 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.509
 I guess it's useless to keep him in this world 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.509
 only acetone is consumed 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:16.639
 as usual 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.439
 greetings and gland all over
