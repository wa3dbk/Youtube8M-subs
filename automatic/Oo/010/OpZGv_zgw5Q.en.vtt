00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
middle of the stage and the skirt is
pretty<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.230> spanning<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> entire<00:01:23.450> stage

pretty much spanning the entire stage

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.260 
pretty much spanning the entire stage
that's<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:25.050> huge<00:01:25.550> visual<00:01:26.550> effect

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
that's a huge visual effect

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
that's a huge visual effect
what's<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:31.110> weighs<00:01:31.500> quite<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.160> more<00:01:32.430> than

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
what's it weighs quite a bit more than

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
what's it weighs quite a bit more than
20<00:01:33.120> pounds<00:01:33.720> I'd<00:01:33.870> say<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.470> mean<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.400> adds<00:01:36.030> quite

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
20 pounds I'd say I mean it's adds quite

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.610 
20 pounds I'd say I mean it's adds quite
a<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.410> weight<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.010> my<00:01:38.640> body<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> it's

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
a bit of weight to my body so it's

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.100 
a bit of weight to my body so it's
difficult<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.520> guess<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.910> keeping<00:01:42.690> up

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
difficult about it I guess is keeping up

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.820 
difficult about it I guess is keeping up
here<00:01:44.030> looking<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.300> you're<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.200> mood<00:01:46.650> of

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
here looking like you're in the mood of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.190 
here looking like you're in the mood of
the<00:01:46.979> piece<00:01:47.250> however<00:01:47.580> down<00:01:48.120> below<00:01:48.509> you're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the piece however down below you're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
the piece however down below you're
constantly<00:01:49.590> trying<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:50.070> make<00:01:50.190> sure<00:01:50.340> you're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
constantly trying to make sure you're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
constantly trying to make sure you're
not<00:01:50.790> tripping<00:01:51.240> over<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> skirt<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.950> know

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
not tripping over the skirt or you know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
not tripping over the skirt or you know
stepping<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> skirt<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.320> keeping

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
stepping on the skirt so I think keeping

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
stepping on the skirt so I think keeping
the<00:01:56.790> craziness<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.900> inside

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the craziness that's going on inside

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.850 
the craziness that's going on inside
your<00:01:58.410> head<00:01:58.470> about<00:01:59.250> falling<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> skirt

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
your head about falling over the skirt

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.070 
your head about falling over the skirt
concealed<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.190> what<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.330> tricky<00:02:03.750> part<00:02:03.869> for

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
concealed is what as a tricky part for

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.960 
concealed is what as a tricky part for
my<00:02:04.170> character<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> also<00:02:05.520> brings<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
my character but it also brings it

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.580 
my character but it also brings it

winds<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.340> skirt<00:02:26.580> gets<00:02:26.790> smaller<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.460 

I<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.500> story<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.970> mean<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.540> if

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
I really like the story I mean it's a if

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.930 
I really like the story I mean it's a if
someone<00:02:40.770> were<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.980> ever<00:02:41.099> ask<00:02:41.310> me<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.640> give<00:02:41.910> up

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
someone were to ever ask me to give up

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.690 
someone were to ever ask me to give up
my<00:02:42.180> career<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.130> imagine<00:02:44.160> how

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
my career I can I just can imagine how

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300 
my career I can I just can imagine how
that<00:02:44.730> feels<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.860> fighting<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> love

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that feels and fighting with the love

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.290 
that feels and fighting with the love
for<00:02:47.550> someone<00:02:47.760> versus<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.800> loss<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:50.130> self<00:02:50.880> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
for someone versus that loss of self I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.199 
for someone versus that loss of self I
think<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.319> really<00:02:52.560> strong<00:02:52.819> story<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.000> tell

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
think it's a really strong story to tell

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.140 
think it's a really strong story to tell
I<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> challenge<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:59.000> like<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
I like the challenge of that I like I

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.059 
I like the challenge of that I like I
think<00:03:00.569> pieces<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.500> are<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.950> reason

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
think pieces like this are the reason

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.000 
think pieces like this are the reason
that<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.430> fell<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.760> love<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.090> dance<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.440> think

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that I fell in love with dance I I think

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.300 
that I fell in love with dance I I think
that<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.870> challenge<00:03:07.319> for<00:03:07.530> me<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.130> what<00:03:08.280> I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that the challenge for me and and what I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.380 
that the challenge for me and and what I
love<00:03:08.580> most<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:10.670> adapting<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.850> character

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
love most is adapting to a character

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.330 
love most is adapting to a character
that's<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.019> little<00:03:13.230> bit<00:03:13.380> myself<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.100> little

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
that's a little bit myself and a little

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.940 
that's a little bit myself and a little
bit<00:03:14.519> somebody<00:03:15.390> else<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.650> either

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
bit somebody else that that is either

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.449 
bit somebody else that that is either
real<00:03:17.250> or<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.610> real<00:03:17.989> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.449 
in this case I mean for us the challenge
is<00:03:22.760> how<00:03:22.879> do<00:03:22.939> you<00:03:23.140> embody<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.920> mind<00:03:25.220> of
