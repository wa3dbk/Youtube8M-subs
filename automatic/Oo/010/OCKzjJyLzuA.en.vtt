in Austin Texas I'm talking to you on
behalf<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.830> expert<00:00:05.339> village<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.450> gonna

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
behalf of expert village and we're gonna

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
behalf of expert village and we're gonna
discuss<00:00:07.280> brakes<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.610> brake<00:00:08.820> levers<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:10.099> let's

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
discuss brakes and brake levers so let's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.830 
discuss brakes and brake levers so let's
start<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.340> mountain<00:00:11.580> bikes<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.480> terms<00:00:12.719> of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
start with mountain bikes in terms of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.299 
start with mountain bikes in terms of
mountain<00:00:13.080> bikes<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.440> generally<00:00:13.830> got<00:00:13.950> three

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
mountain bikes you generally got three

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.010 
mountain bikes you generally got three
different<00:00:14.700> types<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.120> brakes<00:00:15.389> available<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
different types of brakes available to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.170 
different types of brakes available to
you<00:00:16.139> these<00:00:16.260> days<00:00:16.609> something<00:00:17.609> called<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> V

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
you these days something called a V

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.330 
you these days something called a V
brake<00:00:18.480> which<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> brake<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.619> most<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.250> you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
brake which is a brake that most of you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.740 
brake which is a brake that most of you
are<00:00:20.400> probably<00:00:20.580> familiar<00:00:20.939> with

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
are probably familiar with

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
are probably familiar with
it's<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> rim<00:00:22.380> brake<00:00:22.650> meaning<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it's a rim brake meaning that when you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.089 
it's a rim brake meaning that when you
pull<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> lever<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:25.230> pads<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:25.710> compressed

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
pull the lever the pads are compressed

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
pull the lever the pads are compressed
against<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> rim<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.240> wheel

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
against the rim of the wheel

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.560 
against the rim of the wheel
that's<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.769> braking<00:00:29.099> surface<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:30.150> little

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that's your braking surface a little

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
that's your braking surface a little
more<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.710> more<00:00:32.640> common<00:00:33.000> these

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
more bit more of a more common these

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.490 
more bit more of a more common these
days<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.540> mountain<00:00:33.840> bikes<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> something

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
days on mountain bikes is something

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.959 
days on mountain bikes is something
called<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> disc<00:00:34.980> brake<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.850> two

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
called a disc brake and there are two

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.910 
called a disc brake and there are two
different<00:00:36.090> types<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.630> disc<00:00:36.809> brakes<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
different types of disc brakes one is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
different types of disc brakes one is
called<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> mechanical<00:00:38.670> disc<00:00:38.879> brake<00:00:39.230> meaning

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
called a mechanical disc brake meaning

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
called a mechanical disc brake meaning
that<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> pull<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> lever<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that when you pull the lever there is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
that when you pull the lever there is
actually<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> cable<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.690> steel<00:00:42.930> cable<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
actually a cable of steel cable that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.560 
actually a cable of steel cable that
runs<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> brake<00:00:44.520> lever<00:00:44.789> down<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
runs from the brake lever down to the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
runs from the brake lever down to the
brake<00:00:45.780> caliper<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> pull<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
brake caliper and when you pull the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.549 
brake caliper and when you pull the
brake<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.360> compresses<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> brake<00:00:49.289> pads

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
brake it compresses the brake pads

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
brake it compresses the brake pads
against<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> rotor<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.329> attached<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
against the rotor that's attached to the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
against the rotor that's attached to the
front<00:00:52.199> wheel<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> wheel<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> bike

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
front wheel or to the wheel of the bike

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
front wheel or to the wheel of the bike
at<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> hub<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.680> similar<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
at the hub so this is very similar to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
at the hub so this is very similar to
the<00:00:56.309> mechanism<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:57.030> most<00:00:57.660> cars<00:00:57.960> used<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the mechanism that most cars used for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.700 
the mechanism that most cars used for
brakes<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.239> works<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.480> well<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.410> reason

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
brakes and works really well the reason

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
brakes and works really well the reason
that<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.309> becoming<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> more<00:01:03.510> popular

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that it's becoming more and more popular

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
that it's becoming more and more popular
on<00:01:04.229> mountain<00:01:04.710> bikes<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.580> some

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
on mountain bikes is because it has some

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
on mountain bikes is because it has some
distinct<00:01:06.210> advantages<00:01:06.270> over<00:01:06.869> V<00:01:07.170> brakes<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
distinct advantages over V brakes and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940 
distinct advantages over V brakes and
that<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.420> wet<00:01:09.420> muddy<00:01:09.960> conditions<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> lot

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that in wet muddy conditions it's a lot

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.920 
that in wet muddy conditions it's a lot
less<00:01:11.130> likely<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:13.520> contaminated<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
less likely to get contaminated and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.999 
less likely to get contaminated and
decrease<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:15.960> braking<00:01:16.380> performance

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
decrease your braking performance

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.950 
decrease your braking performance
hydraulic<00:01:17.670> brakes<00:01:17.700> work<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.780> similar

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
hydraulic brakes work in a similar

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.030 
hydraulic brakes work in a similar
fashion

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
fashion

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
fashion
meaning<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:20.820> press<00:01:21.030> against<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> Roga

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
meaning that they press against a Roga

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
meaning that they press against a Roga
that's<00:01:21.840> attached<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.320> wheel<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that's attached to your wheel but

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
that's attached to your wheel but
instead<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> having<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> cable<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.299> runs<00:01:24.330> from

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
instead of having a cable that runs from

lever to the caliper it's a hydraulic

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
lever to the caliper it's a hydraulic
hose<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.530> there's<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.920> hydraulic

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hose and there's actually hydraulic

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
hose and there's actually hydraulic
fluid<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.380> more

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
fluid in there it's a little bit more

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.990 
fluid in there it's a little bit more
expensive<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.909> bit

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
expensive but you get a little bit

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.280 
expensive but you get a little bit
better<00:01:33.119> feel<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.200> better

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
better feel and a little bit better
