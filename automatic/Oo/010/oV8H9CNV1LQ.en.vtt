 This is Kelly and you already know 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 I also like to cook in the kitchen 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.890
 here always lends a helping hand to this is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 good even though you will explore the kitchen there 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 fitch recipe for you we already 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 salt popcorn and today is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.370
 making sweet popcorn is easy is fast let's go 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 tell you everything to you that you go 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 I need how to do it but it's a beautiful 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.829
 alternative to when that will 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.860
 eating all true right arriving from 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 eat everything wrong to eat right 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 When you hit that will, give it to us. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.340
 with a little poo here it's nikki now only 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.039
 eye is the best thing starts in guilt 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.019
 it's not exactly a smell to know 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.060
 You're not going to get fat, do not stay. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.700
 worried worker evidence about the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.439
 We will not do it right because yes 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.689
 to kill the urge to eat sweet 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.149
 Guilty are going to start 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.130
 need basic eggs so it's an egg and 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.170
 a bed I really like the hickory eggs 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 inclusive of china blog a tip of a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 mark that I like her the chickens 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.100
 they live free they do not stay in the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.189
 cage so I'd rather buy know of 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.110
 producers as well but it is an organic 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.000
 practice more for them in the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.409
 constant is very cool 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.329
 So I'll leave it all there for you. 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.060
 but basically it's a clear egg and 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.909
 corn then let's use the half banana 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.369
 chopped banana and a silver tablespoon 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.409
 of tapioca flour mixes ajava 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 putting everything in the blender 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.580
 it really gives the flavor in this case is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.420
 that our sweet popcorn strike is of 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.220
 chocolate 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 I'm going to put this same woman as 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.390
 Tapioca thing, I'll put it in law. 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.640
 chocolate and if you do not have 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.599
 supplement in your home to do with 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 cocoa 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.229
 only he has a small detail is that he 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.060
 even talked to me but a car leaves 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 very strong that he is so other 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.799
 concentrated total he has a 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.620
 difference in chocolate powder that people 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.310
 easily in the market 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.709
 So I tip that I give I've done 12 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 at home with cocoa is to use a 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.920
 smaller amount smaller to see if the spoon 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.290
 soup pot full of more ball 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 fast and picks up and just a little bit just one 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.910
 Little bit but there are people nowadays. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 chocolate fides without sugar has 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.019
 alternatives look for alternatives because 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.109
 if in our recipe leaves the cap if you 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.880
 to use the nescau a dodge for example 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.950
 so we put everything in there 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.389
 blender hits until the mixture stays 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.910
 homogeneous we will use a 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.310
 skillet because it will stay the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.690
 perfect size tinho of her and the people 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.459
 is also on the lid 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
 then placed in the frying pan using the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.660
 machine nor need tasci went to the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.330
 tip 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.490
 coconut oil or if you do not find the 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.350
 coconut oil in the society where 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.180
 difficulty can use canola oil 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.160
 so you can see there is also a way to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.410
 It's put in the frying pan. People are the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.180
 not even I 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.970
 I need to see when it is addressed. 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.860
 stay hand sign that the bottom is already 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.930
 dish and our super tip for you 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.860
 to finish putting a cream of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.520
 hazelnut 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.800
 I declare that there are healthy 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.570
 Day we had carob beans with hazelnut cream 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.850
 for those who have lactose intolerance is 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.530

 it has several versions and also has 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.570
 so you look at food stores 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.810

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.270

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.460

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.800
 if faith is easy it does not have as much 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.050
 difficulty but if you find none of this 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.810

 microwave access to the hint of putting 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.360
 very fast is to put no more than 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.550
