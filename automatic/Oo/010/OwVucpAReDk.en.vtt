00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.250 
little video here to explain the footage
right<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:08.400> there<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> glitch<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.990> while

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
right now there was a glitch a while

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.970 
right now there was a glitch a while
back<00:00:10.590> where<00:00:11.780> mobs<00:00:12.780> would<00:00:13.200> not<00:00:13.349> target<00:00:13.740> players

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
back where mobs would not target players

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060 
back where mobs would not target players
whatsoever<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> logged<00:00:16.049> into<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:16.560> alternate

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
whatsoever so I logged into my alternate

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
whatsoever so I logged into my alternate
account<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.609> ran<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> way<00:00:18.840> from<00:00:19.289> rag

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
account and ran all the way from rag

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.820 
account and ran all the way from rag
knee<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.670> Troms<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.939> about<00:00:23.939> 12<00:00:24.539> minutes<00:00:25.289> which

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
knee to Troms and about 12 minutes which

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
knee to Troms and about 12 minutes which
probably<00:00:26.609> could<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> record<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:27.990> saying<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
probably could be a record but saying I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.310 
probably could be a record but saying I
had<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.890> abuse<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> glitch<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> guess

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
had to abuse a glitch to do it I guess

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
had to abuse a glitch to do it I guess
it<00:00:31.560> wouldn't<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.160> probably<00:00:32.640> shouldn't<00:00:32.910> count

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it wouldn't it probably shouldn't count

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
it wouldn't it probably shouldn't count
but<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> bet<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> lot<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.010> people<00:00:35.130> did

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this too so it's not really much but the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.880

town<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> failed<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> bridge<00:01:21.720> part<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
town so if I failed at the bridge part I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
town so if I failed at the bridge part I
would<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.740> respawn<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.350> dragon<00:01:25.350> aid

would just respawn back at a dragon aid
have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.159> over<00:01:26.189> again<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> ran

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
have to do it all over again so I ran

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.740 
have to do it all over again so I ran
back<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.560> sack<00:01:28.939> just<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
back to the sack just to you know get a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
back to the sack just to you know get a
spawn<00:01:31.020> point<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.790> although<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.060> still

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
spawn point there and although I still

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
spawn point there and although I still
make<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> across<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> bridge<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> piece

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
make it across the bridge in one piece

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
make it across the bridge in one piece
pretty<00:01:35.340> easily<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.960> gonna<00:01:40.049> say<00:01:40.259> win
