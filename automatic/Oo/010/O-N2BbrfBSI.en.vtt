Spirit<00:00:41.320> in<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.800> middle<00:00:42.039> of<00:00:42.129> something<00:00:42.399> and

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
Spirit in the middle of something and

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.509 
Spirit in the middle of something and
say<00:00:42.579> now<00:00:42.760> hold<00:00:42.969> on<00:00:43.120> but<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:45.190> gonna<00:00:45.280> have<00:00:45.460> a

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
say now hold on but you're gonna have a

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.720 
say now hold on but you're gonna have a
problem<00:00:46.679> because<00:00:47.679> if<00:00:47.980> we're<00:00:48.460> going<00:00:48.489> to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
problem because if we're going to

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.290 
problem because if we're going to
interpolate<00:00:49.269> that<00:00:49.449> this<00:00:49.809> word<00:00:50.019> si<00:00:50.289> gato<00:00:50.530> means

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
interpolate that this word si gato means

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.720 
interpolate that this word si gato means
hush<00:00:52.300> shut<00:00:52.899> up<00:00:53.079> keep<00:00:53.589> quiet<00:00:53.859> or<00:00:54.219> how<00:00:54.429> are<00:00:54.550> you

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
hush shut up keep quiet or how are you

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.549 
hush shut up keep quiet or how are you
gonna<00:00:54.879> put<00:00:55.089> an<00:00:55.179> emphasis<00:00:55.300> on<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.839> then<00:00:56.410> you're

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
gonna put an emphasis on it then you're

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.470 
gonna put an emphasis on it then you're
going<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.829> have<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.219> deal<00:00:57.429> with<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:58.210> word

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
going to have to deal with this word

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630 
going to have to deal with this word
which<00:00:59.199> is<00:00:59.379> different<00:00:59.769> from<00:00:59.829> this<00:01:00.070> word<00:01:00.339> so

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
which is different from this word so

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.189 
which is different from this word so
basically<00:01:01.089> it<00:01:01.300> says<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.749> Apostle<00:01:01.839> Paul

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
basically it says that the Apostle Paul

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.770 
basically it says that the Apostle Paul
either<00:01:02.829> in<00:01:03.219> one<00:01:03.399> place<00:01:03.670> was<00:01:03.850> telling<00:01:04.150> women<00:01:04.269> to

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
either in one place was telling women to

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.870 
either in one place was telling women to
hush<00:01:04.989> or<00:01:05.980> in<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.340> other<00:01:06.460> place<00:01:06.670> he<00:01:06.820> was

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
hush or in the other place he was

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
hush or in the other place he was
talking<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.270> hush<00:01:07.450> but<00:01:07.659> they're<00:01:07.780> two

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
talking to hush but they're two

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.660 
talking to hush but they're two
different<00:01:08.020> words<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.680> if<00:01:09.190> he<00:01:09.250> was<00:01:09.340> trying<00:01:09.520> to

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
different words and if he was trying to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.800 
different words and if he was trying to
say<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> same<00:01:10.180> thing<00:01:10.390> through<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.690> through

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
say the same thing through and through

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
say the same thing through and through
he'd<00:01:11.050> use<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.410> same<00:01:11.680> word<00:01:11.980> be<00:01:12.760> following<00:01:13.120> me

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
he'd use the same word be following me

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340 
he'd use the same word be following me
so<00:01:15.340> there's<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.120> problem<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.900> theory<00:01:17.200> in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
so there's a problem with that theory in

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.890 
so there's a problem with that theory in
other<00:01:17.500> words<00:01:17.680> my<00:01:17.800> point<00:01:18.160> is<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:19.060> must<00:01:19.330> compare

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
other words my point is you must compare

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.220 
other words my point is you must compare
so<00:01:20.260> I<00:01:20.850> use<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.060> example<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.510> first<00:01:22.780> Timothy

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
so I use the example of first Timothy

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.930 
so I use the example of first Timothy
speaking<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.890> how<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.250> says<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> woman<00:01:24.790> should

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
speaking of how it says a woman should

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.020 
speaking of how it says a woman should
learn<00:01:25.060> in<00:01:25.240> silence<00:01:25.480> that<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.710> stillness<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
learn in silence that is stillness the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.140 
learn in silence that is stillness the
systems<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:28.810> bustle<00:01:29.350> can<00:01:30.250> mean<00:01:30.580> language

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
systems from bustle can mean language

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.360 
systems from bustle can mean language
there's<00:01:31.930> also<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.290> male<00:01:32.620> version<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.220> that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
there's also a male version to that

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.720 
there's also a male version to that
which<00:01:33.760> is<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.270> keep<00:01:34.660> one<00:01:34.960> seat<00:01:35.730> but

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
which is to keep one seat but

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.580 
which is to keep one seat but
essentially<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.600> gist<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.260> refrain

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
essentially the gist of it is to refrain

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.410 
essentially the gist of it is to refrain
from<00:01:38.620> labor<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.720> first<00:01:41.050> Timothy<00:01:41.950> 2<00:01:42.880> 11<00:01:43.270> and
