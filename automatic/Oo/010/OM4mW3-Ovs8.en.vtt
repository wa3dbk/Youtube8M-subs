take a look from here you can see that
we<00:01:19.580> have<00:01:19.610> installed<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.720> 19<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:22.009> tanks

we have installed the 19 in think tanks

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.940 
we have installed the 19 in think tanks
book<00:01:22.910> hello<00:01:23.420> wheels<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.240> other<00:01:26.390> side

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
book hello wheels and on the other side

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.440 
book hello wheels and on the other side
we<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.070> implemented<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.750> five-spoke<00:01:31.450> mesh

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
we have implemented the five-spoke mesh

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.270 
we have implemented the five-spoke mesh
size<00:01:32.780> 19

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
size 19

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.690 
size 19
so<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.510> quite<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.990> distinct<00:01:36.619> look<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:37.159> the

so it is a quite a distinct look of the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.270 
so it is a quite a distinct look of the
car<00:01:37.880> depending<00:01:38.659> on<00:01:38.659> which<00:01:39.260> type<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.890> would

like regarding the inside we have

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.789 
like regarding the inside we have
basically<00:01:43.850> changed<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.869> combination<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.650> you

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
basically changed the combination as you

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.399 
basically changed the combination as you
can<00:01:45.979> see<00:01:46.220> with<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.970> rev<00:01:47.180> counter<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:47.930> much

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
can see with the rev counter now much

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.980
