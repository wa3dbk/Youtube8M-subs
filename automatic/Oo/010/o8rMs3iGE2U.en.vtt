your<00:00:53.219> dream<00:00:53.460> phone<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
your dream phone and I think this is

your dream phone and I think this is
pretty<00:00:55.289> solid<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
pretty solid I think I think the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
pretty solid I think I think the
technology<00:00:58.920> behind<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.059> ready<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
technology behind it is ready I just

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
technology behind it is ready I just
hope<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> big

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
hope that these you know one of the big

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.390 
hope that these you know one of the big
features<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.409> talked<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.010> being<00:01:05.189> able

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
features I talked about was being able

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.770 
features I talked about was being able
to<00:01:05.489> hot<00:01:05.640> swap<00:01:05.970> batteries<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.600> phone

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to hot swap batteries your phone

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
to hot swap batteries your phone
wouldn't<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.229> off<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.650> could<00:01:07.799> pull<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
wouldn't power off you could pull the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.270 
wouldn't power off you could pull the
battery<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.400> put<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> battery<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.100> do<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
battery out put a battery in and do that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.620 
battery out put a battery in and do that
however<00:01:11.790> many<00:01:11.909> times<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
however many times you want it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.700 
however many times you want it
throughout<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> day<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.290> multiple

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
throughout the day with multiple

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
throughout the day with multiple
batteries<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.670> cool<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.150> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
batteries and that's kind of cool I do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.429 
batteries and that's kind of cool I do
like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> idea<00:01:17.509> what<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> wonder<00:01:19.409> about

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
like that idea what I wonder about

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.640 
like that idea what I wonder about
though<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.170> okay<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.530> an

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
though is you know okay so you have an

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
though is you know okay so you have an
exoskeleton<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
exoskeleton and you know you have a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
exoskeleton and you know you have a
Snapdragon<00:01:26.310> 805<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
Snapdragon 805 in there and then you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
Snapdragon 805 in there and then you
want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> put<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> 10<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.549> they

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
want to put in a 10 in you know are they

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.359 
want to put in a 10 in you know are they
going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> keep<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> standard<00:01:30.840> size<00:01:31.369> because

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
going to keep that standard size because

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.210 
going to keep that standard size because
processors<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.060> smaller<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:34.439> processors<00:01:35.040> get

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
processors get smaller as processors get

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
processors get smaller as processors get
more<00:01:35.400> efficient<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.060> anyways<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.900> question<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
more efficient so anyways my question to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.270 
more efficient so anyways my question to
you<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:38.479> what<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.320> project
