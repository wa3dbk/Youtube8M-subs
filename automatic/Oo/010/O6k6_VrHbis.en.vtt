00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:55.260
 but here it is easy to find on the engine 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.260
 is 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.100
 randy lew rest of the oil thrown on the floor is 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.460
 then have a tap to open 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.460
 to empty where you want 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:58.960

 here even used the same pharaoh 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.000
 You can see here but I think I'm 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.900
 alone in front of the car take nothing 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.310
 too much 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.820
 the only detail of the car and if Mr. 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.820
 all sealed 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.610
 besides the cat looks like new 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.130
 also dusty 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.680
 coming home the money stopped in 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.270
 garage there was a wash in it but 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.270
 know if you have an idea of ​​his status 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:08.180
 for those who are looking for a gt and 2000 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.490
 day 3 is the last gti to be in the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.780
 state 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.320
 I ran pretty Brazil, but it's difficult there. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.650
 to find in this case was myself that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.590
 I finished, I do not know everything that was done in the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:36.680
 original car has up to a manual 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:41.680
 here everything is cute the start of the car 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 you see the engine running 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.940
 it is likely 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.940
 by intervening with this 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.260
 the probe running now is in green 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.569
 but it is the job is well the sony is 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.979
 always seeing 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.979

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:51.879
 the display works all that electric 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.840
 The only detail of the car is that it only 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.840
 some lines helped 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.210
 doyle cd but this I think almost everyone 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.670
 explain that you had this problem 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.090
 nothing that is difficult is not just gonna roll 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.160
 planning is really 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.000
