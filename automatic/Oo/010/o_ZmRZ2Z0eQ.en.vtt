00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
the outer eyelid with the same brush I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.480 
the outer eyelid with the same brush I
think<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.500> easiest<00:03:35.890> way<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:36.370> it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
think that's the easiest way to do it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.550 
think that's the easiest way to do it
keep<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> brush<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.600> same<00:03:37.840> don't<00:03:38.260> try<00:03:38.500> and

keep the brush the same don't try and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.660 
keep the brush the same don't try and
use<00:03:38.709> too<00:03:38.830> many<00:03:38.920> brushes<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.459> can<00:03:39.550> flip

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
use too many brushes and you can flip

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.070 
use too many brushes and you can flip
the<00:03:39.790> brush<00:03:39.970> over<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:40.390> blend<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.780> colors

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080
