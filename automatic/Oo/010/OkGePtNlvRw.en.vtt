00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.630 
squishy Stamper I can just squish it
down<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:19.280> then<00:02:20.280> you've<00:02:20.400> got<00:02:20.550> your

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
down like that and then you've got your

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.210 
down like that and then you've got your
gradient<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.870> goes<00:02:22.110> pink<00:02:22.470> purple<00:02:22.950> blue<00:02:25.220> see

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
gradient so it goes pink purple blue see

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.740 
gradient so it goes pink purple blue see
that<00:02:29.450> okay<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.110> next<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.510> going<00:02:33.690> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that okay so the next one it's going to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.640 
that okay so the next one it's going to
clean<00:02:33.989> off<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.290> plate<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.830> between<00:02:36.650> your

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
clean off my plate in between your

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.460 
clean off my plate in between your
acetone<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:41.820> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.350> put<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
acetone and then I'm going to put the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.600 
acetone and then I'm going to put the
pink<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.160> side<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:45.000> time<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.489> you're

going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.850> get<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> gradient<00:02:51.569> going<00:02:51.840> across

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
going to get the gradient going across

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.150 
going to get the gradient going across
the<00:02:52.620> nail<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.850> again<00:02:57.120> scrape<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.410> then<00:02:58.739> move

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
it looks so cool and it just takes

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080 
it looks so cool and it just takes
stamping<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> bit<00:05:10.950> of<00:05:11.040> an<00:05:11.160> extra<00:05:11.550> level<00:05:11.729> if

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
stamping to a bit of an extra level if

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.200
