into the game launches the game little

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
into the game launches the game little
bit<00:01:09.390> faster<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.920> because

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bit faster and I put that there because

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
bit faster and I put that there because
I<00:01:11.460> don't<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.150> waiting<00:01:12.360> around<00:01:12.479> i'm<00:01:12.840> very

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I don't like waiting around i'm very

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
I don't like waiting around i'm very
impatient<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.460> second<00:01:14.760> part<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
impatient and the second part here is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
impatient and the second part here is
cpu<00:01:16.350> count<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.390> your

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
cpu count so this is going to be your

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
cpu count so this is going to be your
course<00:01:19.409> how<00:01:19.830> many<00:01:20.040> core<00:01:20.189> cpu<00:01:20.729> herself<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
course how many core cpu herself you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
course how many core cpu herself you
have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> dual<00:01:21.720> core<00:01:21.990> quad<00:01:22.229> core<00:01:22.500> m<00:01:22.619> 6<00:01:22.950> core<00:01:23.220> or

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
if you have knocked octa-core and put

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.800 
if you have knocked octa-core and put
that<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:27.119> also<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that in you're also going to want to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
that in you're also going to want to
find<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.229> many<00:01:28.290> extra<00:01:28.560> treads<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.700> CPU

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
find out how many extra treads your CPU

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.080 
find out how many extra treads your CPU
has<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> best<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.909> you've

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
has so best way to do that is if you've

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.899 
has so best way to do that is if you've
got<00:01:33.270> windows<00:01:33.570> seven<00:01:34.100> there<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.729> little

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
got windows seven there is this little

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
got windows seven there is this little
gadget<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.600> handy<00:01:36.930> luggage<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.979> tells

gadget here it's handy luggage it tells

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980 
gadget here it's handy luggage it tells
you<00:01:38.310> exactly<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.820> many<00:01:38.880> cores<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.540> each<00:01:39.689> core

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you exactly how many cores on each core

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
you exactly how many cores on each core
represents<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> threat<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.850> first<00:01:42.090> car<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
going to be a standard default thread

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
going to be a standard default thread
and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.189> every<00:01:45.090> core<00:01:45.390> after<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> your

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and then every core after that is your

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
and then every core after that is your
extra<00:01:46.710> threads<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.509> six<00:01:48.840> cores<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
extra threads so I have six cores so I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.130 
extra threads so I have six cores so I
have<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:50.939> standard<00:01:51.360> default<00:01:51.509> thread<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have this my standard default thread and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
have this my standard default thread and
five<00:01:52.829> extra<00:01:53.189> tracks<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.759> why<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
five extra tracks so that's why I have

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.300 
five extra tracks so that's why I have
inbox<00:01:55.070> six<00:01:56.070> cores

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
inbox six cores

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.450 
inbox six cores
five<00:01:57.970> extra<00:01:58.329> threads<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.829> you're<00:02:00.280> going<00:02:00.399> to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
five extra threads so you're going to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.399 
five extra threads so you're going to
want<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.700> find<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.270> because<00:02:01.509> then<00:02:02.229> why

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
want to find that it because then why

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.460 
want to find that it because then why
this<00:02:02.470> basic<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.520> six<00:02:04.000> cores<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.570> six<00:02:05.200> tribes

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
this basic it's six cores and six tribes

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.339 
this basic it's six cores and six tribes
and<00:02:05.619> total<00:02:05.950> with<00:02:06.460> some<00:02:06.729> say<00:02:07.450> quad<00:02:07.720> core<00:02:07.960> i5<00:02:08.319> and

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
and total with some say quad core i5 and

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.770 
and total with some say quad core i5 and
i7<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.099> I've<00:02:09.160> seen<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.700> two<00:02:09.849> tutorials<00:02:10.360> have

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
i7 so I've seen on to two tutorials have

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.759 
i7 so I've seen on to two tutorials have
had<00:02:11.380> four<00:02:11.980> chords<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.580> eight<00:02:13.030> threads<00:02:13.769> having

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
had four chords and eight threads having

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.370 
had four chords and eight threads having
one<00:02:15.250> basic<00:02:16.060> standard<00:02:16.390> shred<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.720> core<00:02:16.959> one<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
one basic standard shred of core one and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.440 
one basic standard shred of core one and
seven<00:02:17.980> extra<00:02:18.310> tracks<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.880> you're<00:02:19.180> definitely

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
seven extra tracks so you're definitely

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
seven extra tracks so you're definitely
going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> want<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> find<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.440> out<00:02:20.500> because
