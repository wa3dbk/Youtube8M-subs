00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.479 
you spawn on I'm guessing that this is
your<00:02:28.940> starter<00:02:29.480> island<00:02:29.989> fairly<00:02:30.950> big<00:02:31.159> lot<00:02:31.400> of

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
your starter island fairly big lot of

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.740 
your starter island fairly big lot of
trees<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.000> shouldn't<00:02:32.300> have<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.599> worry

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
trees so you shouldn't have to worry

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.509 
trees so you shouldn't have to worry
about<00:02:32.959> dying<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.739> only<00:02:33.890> problem<00:02:34.099> is<00:02:34.280> there

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
about dying the only problem is there

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.670 
about dying the only problem is there
isn't<00:02:34.730> really<00:02:35.060> too<00:02:35.629> much<00:02:35.659> of<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.050> food<00:02:36.379> source

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
isn't really too much of a food source

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.559 
isn't really too much of a food source
so<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.099> gonna<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.760> get<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.360> lot<00:02:38.540> of

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
so you're gonna have to get a lot of

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.600 
so you're gonna have to get a lot of
seeds<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.200> make<00:02:39.349> some<00:02:39.620> bread<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:39.920> go<00:02:40.310> from

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
seeds and make some bread and go from

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.899 
seeds and make some bread and go from
there<00:02:40.879> now<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:41.750> left<00:02:41.989> we<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.980> desert

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
there now to my left we have a desert

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.690 
there now to my left we have a desert
biome<00:02:44.300> or<00:02:44.750> each<00:02:44.959> one<00:02:45.260> at<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.890> bottom<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.519> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
biome or each one at the bottom of it it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.729 
biome or each one at the bottom of it it
is<00:02:46.879> filled<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.360> bedrock<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.140> can't<00:02:48.470> mind

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
is filled with bedrock so you can't mind

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.619 
is filled with bedrock so you can't mind
through<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.159> so<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.370> won't<00:02:49.640> die<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
through it so you won't die and the

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.910 
through it so you won't die and the
difference<00:02:50.810> between<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.440> one<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
difference between this one and the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800 
difference between this one and the
other<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.519> there's<00:02:53.060> no<00:02:53.209> water<00:02:53.510> between

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
other one is there's no water between

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.600 
other one is there's no water between
this<00:02:54.230> one<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:54.620> I'm<00:02:54.680> guessing<00:02:54.920> he<00:02:55.250> did<00:02:55.459> this

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
this one so I'm guessing he did this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.490 
this one so I'm guessing he did this
with<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.849> tool<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:56.959> when<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.350> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
with a tool and because when you go to a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.440 
with a tool and because when you go to a
certain<00:02:57.709> distance<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.459> will<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.940> die<00:02:59.180> or

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
certain distance you will just die or

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
certain distance you will just die or
you<00:02:59.480> will<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.870> hit<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.230> floor<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.740> but<00:03:01.220> I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
you will just hit the floor and but I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.350 
you will just hit the floor and but I
would<00:03:01.400> love<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.580> make<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.850> brand<00:03:02.120> new

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
would love to make a brand new

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.300 
would love to make a brand new
series<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.980> one<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.250> lot

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
series on this and I like this one a lot

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.550 
series on this and I like this one a lot
because<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.060> has<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.420> stuff<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.050> which<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
because it has the stuff and which the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.510 
because it has the stuff and which the
other<00:03:06.770> one<00:03:06.920> didnt<00:03:07.340> over<00:03:07.940> here<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.390> have<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:09.520> snow

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
other one didnt over here we have a snow

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.820 
other one didnt over here we have a snow
biome<00:03:10.850> I'm<00:03:11.210> guessing<00:03:11.630> which<00:03:11.780> has<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.020> dog<00:03:12.470> on<00:03:12.650> it

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
biome I'm guessing which has a dog on it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.590 
biome I'm guessing which has a dog on it
it<00:03:12.980> did<00:03:13.130> have<00:03:13.310> lots<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.610> piggies<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.240> but<00:03:14.450> I

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it did have lots of piggies on it but I

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
it did have lots of piggies on it but I
guess<00:03:14.810> they've<00:03:15.020> gone<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:16.280> over<00:03:16.400> here<00:03:16.520> we

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
guess they've gone then over here we

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.480 
guess they've gone then over here we
have<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.680> jungle<00:03:18.680> biome<00:03:19.100> which<00:03:19.130> I'm<00:03:19.460> very

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
have a jungle biome which I'm very

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.670 
have a jungle biome which I'm very
looking<00:03:19.940> forward<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.390> exploring<00:03:20.960> now<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:21.530> I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
looking forward to exploring now like I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.170 
looking forward to exploring now like I

are<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.860> with<00:03:31.040> me<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.820> then<00:03:32.090> over<00:03:32.300> here<00:03:32.330> we

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
are up to with me and then over here we

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.060 
are up to with me and then over here we
just<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.990> different<00:03:33.230> buyer<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.680> think<00:03:33.950> it's

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
just have a different buyer I think it's

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.740 
just have a different buyer I think it's
maybe<00:03:34.190> like<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.520> mushroom<00:03:34.790> biome<00:03:35.209> ore<00:03:35.540> swamp

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
maybe like a mushroom biome ore swamp

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.530 
maybe like a mushroom biome ore swamp
iron<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.740> then<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.610> see<00:03:37.820> here<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.330> has

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
iron and then you can see here this has

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.720 
iron and then you can see here this has
an<00:03:38.720> awesome<00:03:39.080> ravine<00:03:39.770> going<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.580> this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
an awesome ravine going for it so this

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.420 
an awesome ravine going for it so this
is<00:03:41.090> an<00:03:41.270> incredible<00:03:41.930> design<00:03:42.350> I<00:03:42.380> mean<00:03:42.800> massive

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
is an incredible design I mean massive

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.670 
is an incredible design I mean massive
thanks<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.030> broadband<00:03:44.510> who<00:03:44.690> did<00:03:44.989> design<00:03:45.410> this

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
thanks to broadband who did design this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.370 
thanks to broadband who did design this
i<00:03:45.920> think<00:03:45.980> these<00:03:46.340> maps<00:03:46.640> are<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.120> enjoyable<00:03:47.780> and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
i think these maps are so enjoyable and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.960 
i think these maps are so enjoyable and
i<00:03:48.440> will<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.650> bringing<00:03:48.800> more<00:03:49.190> map<00:03:49.370> reviews<00:03:49.790> on

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
i will be bringing more map reviews on

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.240 
i will be bringing more map reviews on
my<00:03:50.480> channel<00:03:50.900> as<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.320> future<00:03:51.650> goes<00:03:51.800> by<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.100> i

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
my channel as the future goes by and i

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.880 
my channel as the future goes by and i
did<00:03:52.459> just<00:03:52.489> spot<00:03:52.760> diamonds<00:03:53.480> right<00:03:54.110> there<00:03:54.560> and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
did just spot diamonds right there and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.560 
did just spot diamonds right there and
so<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:55.430> i<00:03:55.520> do<00:03:55.580> play<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.030> at<00:03:56.209> least<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.420> know

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
so if i do play this at least I know

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.150 
so if i do play this at least I know
where<00:03:56.720> two<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.050> them<00:03:57.170> are<00:03:57.320> but<00:03:57.920> apart<00:03:58.130> from
