the<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> free<00:00:59.520> trust<00:00:59.850> presto<00:01:00.420> hair<00:01:00.660> comes

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the way the free trust presto hair comes

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.679 
the way the free trust presto hair comes
it<00:01:01.379> has<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:03.030> small<00:01:03.329> bundles<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.500> each<00:01:04.830> pack

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
it has two small bundles in each pack

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
it has two small bundles in each pack
and<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.500> long<00:01:07.770> enough<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> I'm

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and I think this is long enough that I'm

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.450 
and I think this is long enough that I'm
going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> cut<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> half<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.310> does<00:01:11.310> not

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to just cut it in half it does not

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
going to just cut it in half it does not
come<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> link<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.810> sure<00:01:13.020> exactly

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
come with a link so I'm not sure exactly

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
come with a link so I'm not sure exactly
how<00:01:13.650> long<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:17.450> yeah<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.630> going

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
how long it is but yeah I'm just going

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
how long it is but yeah I'm just going
to<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.170> ahead<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> cut<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:19.979> that'll

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to go ahead and cut it because that'll

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
to go ahead and cut it because that'll
make<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.420> length<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> that's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
make it about that length and that's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
make it about that length and that's
good<00:01:23.939> enough<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:27.630> time<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> only

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
good enough for me so this time I only

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
good enough for me so this time I only
did<00:01:28.380> ten<00:01:28.650> braids<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:31.640> I'm<00:01:32.640> hoping<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.060> it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
did ten braids so I'm hoping that it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
did ten braids so I'm hoping that it's
not<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> turn<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:34.020> real<00:01:34.380> thick<00:01:34.710> because

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
not going to turn out real thick because

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
not going to turn out real thick because
