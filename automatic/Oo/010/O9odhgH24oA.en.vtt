factories around the world this is

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.630 
factories around the world this is
spectacular<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.839> is<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.369> a

result<00:01:12.899> is<00:01:13.080> we've<00:01:13.530> radically<00:01:14.399> reduced<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
result is we've radically reduced the

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
the cost of building the car so what we

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.940 
the cost of building the car so what we
want<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.069> do<00:01:26.429> is<00:01:27.080> take<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.289> first<00:01:28.409> prototype

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
want to do is take the first prototype

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
want to do is take the first prototype
which<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.280> quickly<00:01:29.759> built<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.299> shows<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
which we quickly built which shows the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.760 
which we quickly built which shows the
functionality<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.069> that<00:01:33.030> approach<00:01:33.330> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
functionality of that approach and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.850 
functionality of that approach and
around<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.039> build<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.170> design

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
around it build all of the design

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
around it build all of the design
elements<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.670> manufacturing<00:01:39.420> elements<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
elements and manufacturing elements that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
elements and manufacturing elements that
would<00:01:40.590> allow<00:01:40.860> us<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.280> scale<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.820> an<00:01:42.090> annual

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
would allow us to scale up to an annual

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
would allow us to scale up to an annual
production<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:43.280> 10,000<00:01:44.280> vehicles<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:45.390> take

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
production of 10,000 vehicles then take

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.520

and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.519> produces<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> platform<00:02:24.989> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and then produces a platform that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.479 
and then produces a platform that
someone<00:02:25.530> who<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.070> expertise

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
someone who doesn't have that expertise

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.390 
someone who doesn't have that expertise
can<00:02:27.150> build<00:02:27.329> on<00:02:27.420> top<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.709> exactly<00:02:28.709> yeah<00:02:28.859> we<00:02:29.310> have

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
can build on top of exactly yeah we have

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.699 
can build on top of exactly yeah we have
kind<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.049> solved<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.109> lot<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.380> those<00:02:31.500> challenges

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
kind of solved a lot of those challenges

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.630 
kind of solved a lot of those challenges
and<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.549> idea<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.750> DM<00:02:34.019> micro<00:02:34.350> factory<00:02:34.769> right

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and the idea is a DM micro factory right

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.660 
and the idea is a DM micro factory right
will<00:02:36.030> allow<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:37.829> know<00:02:37.950> semi<00:02:38.220> skilled<00:02:38.489> people

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
will allow you know semi skilled people

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.569 
will allow you know semi skilled people
to<00:02:39.299> actually<00:02:39.660> build<00:02:39.930> together<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.319> car<00:02:40.799> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
to actually build together a car that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.400 
to actually build together a car that
historically<00:02:42.269> has<00:02:42.450> required<00:02:42.840> either<00:02:42.989> huge

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
historically has required either huge

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.770 
historically has required either huge
amounts<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.739> investment<00:02:43.949> or<00:02:44.370> has<00:02:45.359> required

amounts of investment or has required

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.259 
amounts of investment or has required
very<00:02:46.229> skilled<00:02:46.560> people<00:02:46.880> some<00:02:47.880> people<00:02:48.180> are

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
very skilled people some people are

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:48.980 
very skilled people some people are
doing

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
doing

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.920 
doing
Arduino<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> I'd<00:02:50.460> like<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.880> think<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.780> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
Arduino and I'd like to think not to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.780 
Arduino and I'd like to think not to
sound<00:02:52.080> too<00:02:52.230> hokey<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.950> could<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.310> card<00:02:53.610> we

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
sound too hokey this could be card we

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
sound too hokey this could be card we
know<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.540> at<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> very<00:02:54.810> different<00:02:55.650> scale<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
know but at a very different scale and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.720 
know but at a very different scale and
obviously<00:02:56.550> with<00:02:57.590> industrial-strength<00:02:58.730> types

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
obviously with industrial-strength types

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.810 
obviously with industrial-strength types
of<00:02:59.970> tools<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.540> 3d<00:03:01.320> metal<00:03:01.920> printing<00:03:02.370> yeah<00:03:02.550> I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
of tools like 3d metal printing yeah I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
of tools like 3d metal printing yeah I
love<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.420> analogy<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.080> Arduino<00:03:04.470> because

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
love the analogy to the Arduino because

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.750 
love the analogy to the Arduino because
just<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.070> they<00:03:05.190> are<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.550> you're

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
just like they are do we know you're

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.400 
just like they are do we know you're
you're<00:03:06.300> doing<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> hard<00:03:06.750> engineering<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
you're doing the hard engineering and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500 
you're doing the hard engineering and
then<00:03:07.500> giving<00:03:07.740> people<00:03:07.890> an<00:03:08.070> abstracted<00:03:08.730> module

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
then giving people an abstracted module

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.910 
then giving people an abstracted module
that<00:03:09.600> they<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.870> use<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.290> dramatically

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
that they can use and dramatically

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.340 
that they can use and dramatically
lowering<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> barrier<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:13.200> creating

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
lowering the barrier to creating

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.890 
lowering the barrier to creating
something<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.670> car<00:03:14.910> isn't<00:03:15.120> conventional<00:03:15.810> at

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
something this car isn't conventional at

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.240 
something this car isn't conventional at
all<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.620> assembled<00:03:17.070> it

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
all in the way that it's assembled it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.430 
all in the way that it's assembled it
has<00:03:17.400> these<00:03:17.580> nodes<00:03:18.080> tell<00:03:19.080> me<00:03:19.170> about<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
has these nodes tell me about the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.050 
has these nodes tell me about the
network<00:03:19.740> so<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> note<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.550> Lego<00:03:20.820> block

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
network so the note is like a Lego block

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780 
network so the note is like a Lego block
and<00:03:21.420> from<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.260> single<00:03:23.070> Lego<00:03:23.250> block<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.670> can

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and from that single Lego block you can

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.340 
and from that single Lego block you can
create<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.180> complex<00:03:24.660> structures<00:03:25.140> and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
create really complex structures and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.560 
create really complex structures and
what<00:03:25.800> we<00:03:25.920> did<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.580> Lego<00:03:26.760> block<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.270> printed

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
what we did is the Lego block is printed

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.720 
what we did is the Lego block is printed
out<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.780> aluminum<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.350> with<00:03:29.070> 3d<00:03:29.370> printing<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
out of aluminum and with 3d printing you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.640 
out of aluminum and with 3d printing you
can<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:30.030> very<00:03:30.270> elaborate<00:03:30.780> complex<00:03:31.170> shapes<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
can do very elaborate complex shapes and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.250 
can do very elaborate complex shapes and
optimize<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.220> weight<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.700> strength<00:03:32.910> and

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
optimize it for weight and strength and

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.050 
optimize it for weight and strength and
realize<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.470> efficiencies<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
realize the efficiencies and that the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.730 
realize the efficiencies and that the
fact<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.360> part<00:03:36.660> complexity<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.230> free<00:03:37.260> with

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
fact that part complexity is free with

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.830 
fact that part complexity is free with
3d<00:03:37.920> printing<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.430> then<00:03:38.940> use<00:03:39.120> common

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
3d printing and then use common

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.990 
3d printing and then use common
off-the-shelf<00:03:40.070> carbon<00:03:41.070> fiber<00:03:41.250> tubes<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.880> do

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
off-the-shelf carbon fiber tubes to do

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.970 
off-the-shelf carbon fiber tubes to do
some<00:03:42.240> of<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.480> longer<00:03:42.840> bigger<00:03:43.320> pieces<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
some of the longer bigger pieces and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.520 
some of the longer bigger pieces and
with<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.940> get<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> highly<00:03:45.530> optimized

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
with that you get a highly optimized

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.320 
with that you get a highly optimized
structure<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:47.010> both<00:03:47.130> weight<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.430> cost<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
structure for both weight and cost and

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.480 
structure for both weight and cost and
you<00:03:48.780> do<00:03:48.900> things<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.980> conventional

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
you do things that can in a conventional

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.190 
you do things that can in a conventional
way<00:03:50.580> could<00:03:50.730> never<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.000> done<00:03:51.150> before<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.140> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
way could never be done before so you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.440 
way could never be done before so you
can<00:03:52.260> almost<00:03:52.440> imagine<00:03:52.800> taking<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.340> node<00:03:53.550> putting

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
can almost imagine taking a node putting

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.240 
can almost imagine taking a node putting
a<00:03:54.480> carbon<00:03:54.780> tube<00:03:55.020> right<00:03:55.680> gluing<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.130> together

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
a carbon tube right gluing it together

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.910 
a carbon tube right gluing it together
put<00:03:57.060> another<00:03:57.240> node<00:03:57.480> another<00:03:58.020> carbon<00:03:58.410> tube<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
put another node another carbon tube and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.300 
put another node another carbon tube and
very<00:03:59.190> quickly<00:03:59.520> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.660> scale<00:04:01.020> up<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.740> massive

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
very quickly you can scale up to massive

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.600 
very quickly you can scale up to massive

a point where we can actually make a car

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.250 
a point where we can actually make a car
out<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.210> think<00:04:09.540> within<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> last<00:04:10.020> nine

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
out of it I think within the last nine

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.650 
out of it I think within the last nine
months<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.980> actually<00:04:11.400> become<00:04:12.120> physically

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
months it's actually become physically

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.570 
months it's actually become physically
possible<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.950> that's<00:04:14.220> pretty<00:04:14.430> cool

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
possible and that that's pretty cool

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.070 
possible and that that's pretty cool
there's<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.060> long<00:04:15.240> way<00:04:15.360> for<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.630> go<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.049> I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
there's a long way for it to go but I

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080 
there's a long way for it to go but I
think<00:04:16.320> right<00:04:17.250> now<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.580> at<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.730> point<00:04:17.760> where

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
think right now it's at a point where

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.700 
think right now it's at a point where
obviously<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> other<00:04:18.780> prototypes<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.560> are

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
obviously the other prototypes that are

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.430 
obviously the other prototypes that are
right<00:04:19.799> there<00:04:20.010> we<00:04:20.820> better<00:04:21.030> think<00:04:21.390> about<00:04:21.540> some

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
right there we better think about some

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.320 
right there we better think about some
alternative<00:04:23.100> other<00:04:23.310> than<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.850> current<00:04:24.150> way

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
alternative other than the current way

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.540 
alternative other than the current way
of<00:04:24.570> manufacturing<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.740> scaling<00:04:26.220> up<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
of manufacturing and scaling up and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.120 
of manufacturing and scaling up and
using<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.330> material<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.960> energy<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.830> we

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
using the material and energy that we

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.450 
using the material and energy that we
use<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.760> build<00:04:30.240> these<00:04:30.450> things<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.020> if<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.250> can

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
use to build these things and if I can

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.210 
use to build these things and if I can
think<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:34.350> entrepreneurial

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
think of this other entrepreneurial

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.290 
think of this other entrepreneurial
teams<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:36.090> take<00:04:36.360> these<00:04:36.540> tools<00:04:36.840> as<00:04:37.170> well<00:04:37.800> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
teams can take these tools as well and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.090 
teams can take these tools as well and
radically<00:04:39.300> innovate<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:39.930> radically<00:04:40.710> create

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
radically innovate and radically create

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.450 
radically innovate and radically create
I<00:04:41.310> want<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.210> create<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> catalyst<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.200> that

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
I want to create the catalyst for that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.500 
I want to create the catalyst for that
thank<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:44.700> much<00:04:44.820> Kevin<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.240> great<00:04:45.390> to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
thank you so much Kevin it's great to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.940 
thank you so much Kevin it's great to
talk<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.990> really<00:04:46.260> appreciate<00:04:46.710> your<00:04:46.830> being

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
talk and really appreciate your being

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.160 
talk and really appreciate your being
part<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.310> solid<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.790> think<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.150> is<00:04:48.300> core<00:04:48.930> to

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
part of solid I think this is core to

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.720 
part of solid I think this is core to
the<00:04:49.290> program<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.950> this<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.400> going<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.610> be<00:04:50.700> a

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
the program and this is going to be a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.810 
the program and this is going to be a
spectacular<00:04:51.390> part<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.720> it
