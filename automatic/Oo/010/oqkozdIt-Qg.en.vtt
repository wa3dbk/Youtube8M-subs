00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
these one-piece sticks you're actually

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.830 
these one-piece sticks you're actually
you're<00:00:27.070> able<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.280> really<00:00:27.610> use<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.850> whip<00:00:28.660> we

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840

you're able to really use the whip we
call<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.650> would<00:00:29.770> be<00:00:29.860> the<00:00:29.980> whip<00:00:30.160> see<00:00:30.460> that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
call it it would be the whip see that

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.270 
call it it would be the whip see that
eyelet<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.930> that<00:00:32.529> whip<00:00:32.710> on<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.039> stick
