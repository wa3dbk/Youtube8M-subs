00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.410
 Hey, guys 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.199
 Although the Duke is the speaker and today I 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 I'm here to do that tutorial 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.500
 how to do the little ball I did other 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500
 video 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 so it's very easy to make the journey 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.540
 Easy, but there's a mother like that. 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.399
 makes the round construction that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.960
 you want after you learn to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.489
 do it here but then let's do it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 pick up the material to make her black 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 red and white can also use 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.040
 iron blocks but here comes your 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 own choice 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 The first step is for you to do this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 circle on the floor doing test has a 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.200
 basis for building what is the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.910
 structure of the good time 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 I'm only here after I 'm going to stay 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.340
 ready because everything is already going to have 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.259
 everything is ready then you just need a base 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.380
 but I just wanted to say there are photos 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 of these conditions is at the end of the video 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.509
 So, you paulo video and you're doing 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 look at the picture I'll leave the numbers 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.780
 corresponding to the small amount 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520
 isolated 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 So you're going to have to end the year with 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.259
 the father does not just follow the format and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.240
 use a number that is jammed there 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.619
 You 're only in red, was it to try? 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.049
 leave red number 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:04.409
 we have a cow invading us 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:07.380
 formats're there is this here you 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.660
 will vote for it but if the sequence is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.660
 very simple five blocks of black color 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:25.950
 3225 time one off 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:26.489
 Then you repeat from training 2 235 and so 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.549
 onwards 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.920
 voter 3221 there 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.340
 and so it goes if you do not have the right 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.790
 follow only the format and the image at the end 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.630
 of the video but after you did it 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.750
 here you will climb make this circle 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.840
 higher than the recommended is to the top 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.299
 It is getting stuck to the ground possession of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.530
 ball but you do yanel up here and 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.350
 angry and then make two 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.640
 Empire so รณ one that direction I'm 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.300
 in this direction 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.730
 the only thing that will change is the direction 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.250
 and equalization of the block it will give 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.690
 He's already upset, but the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.430
 numbering is the same thing has not changed at all 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.480
 then the difference is that you will not have 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.980
 that join you will get the whip 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.800
 blocks you start forwards 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.160
 you will tell two was put in 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:39.780
 above and below the same score of 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.970
 means doing the same thing here but 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.519
 then you did it here is the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.519
 structure of the time although what more do you 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.160
 will fill this part here to do 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.569
 the football ring then you will get 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.420
 so it will put until the first 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.459
 At this point I 'm going to make a little bit of 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:08.500
 You 're not going to pull me there until then. 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:11.200
 underneath too will do here I go 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.310
 get this part you will have in here already 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:22.780
 will follow the other low sequence 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 Here you are, here you are. 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.110
 doing everything around her all there goes 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.140
 always stay so much there 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.090
 now you will get the red wing going 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.720
 follow up here 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.720
 following here 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.210
 There you go and do it in every thing there. 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.700
 When you get here, you will not do it. 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.360
 This is not where you go next. 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.210
 pick up and go vote behind the black block 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.169
 always putting so behind the block 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.930
 When will you get here and cover? 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.460
 bay after you arrive here to make the 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.340
 back too you will do it 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.720
 here was hitting behind everything much less 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.300
 frequent 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.940
 then after you get red is 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.210
 do the same thing only he down 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.840
 with white wool when it's ready you 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.330
 make the button here in front and that's it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.020
 basically the difficult of this construction 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.740
 here is to do is round is rest 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.160
 pretty easy fuck 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.400
 anyway the photos is not in the description 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.980
 worry I will leave until this 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.530
 filled red space and space 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.940
 white is also making it easier for 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:51.430
 his understanding of construction is then 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.780
 that's what I had to say 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.080
 I hope it has helped you to 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.610
 build this little ball was confusing 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.340
 so but I 'm not very accustomed 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.150
 to tutor but can not play 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.480
 but then if you liked the video god 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.150
 I liked the favorite share with your 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.120
 family your friends your enemies 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.180
 maybe and everyone else you want is and 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.440
 we'll stick around a hug 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.440
 what sap
