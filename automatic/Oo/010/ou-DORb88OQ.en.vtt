00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 Ford has its own with the s-max 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.750
 niches created the sport activity 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.550
 Vehicles short sav in september 2015 goes 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 the second generation of the sporty 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.720
 Family vans at the start 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.970
 Ford joined in his sport when 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.859
 goal set that the new continues as 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.109
 However, s-max remains recognizable 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.410
 sufficiently fresh and different from 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.360
 Generation 1 in design is quite a bit 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.190
 happens the new s max has the typical 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.170
 Ford nose with the new radiator grille 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.390
 we have narrower led 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.130
 front headlight is in the sideline 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.899
 the vehicle simply drawn sharper 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.879
 not that richer and stronger 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.800
 on the street which I like very much 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.090
 the s max still looks like a s 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.010
 max and does not have his clock gene 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.570
 lost the a column at the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.430
 Windshield is a bit backwards 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.190
 hiked and leaves the bonnet 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 appear relatively long 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.120
 the side is a little higher 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.620
 Waistline recognizable at the tail falls one 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.109
 wider tailgate on the the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.390
 generous width of the s-max optically 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.310
 highlights an important selling point 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.290
 for a very clear is that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.720
 Space as you can see I'm sitting with 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.159
 My 1 meter 95 front very comfortable 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.520
 this also applies to the passenger seat 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.020
 but as you can see afterwards 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.939
 it back basically even then 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.250
 enough space if the driver is very big 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.240
 but at my size , the s-max comes up 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.340
 its limits when it comes to the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.570
 head freedom I can go to a rest 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.850
 put it back a bit 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.110
 I have more headroom but at 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.950
 my stature maybe then 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 rather forward 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.680
 no less than 32 seated positions 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.829
 to do this with the three rows 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.909
 Luggage volume can be up to 2200 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.119
 increase liter 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.759
 with onboard more than 20 novel ones 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.130
 technologies that love the car max 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.479
 pleasant comfortable dynamic or 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.549
 to make it safer 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.930
 a new technology that is also in there 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.950
 the application still does not exist ours 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.990
 intelligence of speed 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.890
 Control system with this system can the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.110
 driver a travel speed 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.430
 enter and the system regulates 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.930
 automatically to the highest allowed 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 speed a corresponding 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 put 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 to be a unique feature 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.780
 should keep the new s next yet 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.650
 become more sporty than the first 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.020
 generation 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.910
 of course without the claim to one 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.430
 pronounced family friendly 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.780
 lose vehicle 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 that's why the engineers have that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.860
 Suspension in two ways 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.770
 Made agility and comfort 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.300
 It came in things steering a real 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.700
 World novelty 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.290
 the adaptive steering the depending on 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.970
 driven speed and 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 Steering lock the translation ratio 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.739
 so can adapt that the driver 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.510
 this is the easiest game 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.280
 Steering changes their burial over the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.780
 entire speed range at 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.150
 low speeds will be the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.269
 translation increased and that up to 30 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.769
 percent , the vehicle is still alida 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.390
 unknown even better handling at 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.700
 high speeds will be translated 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.980
 that reduces it almost quietly 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.019
 and even more comfortable freeway at 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.060
 our first test drives with the new one 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.280
 Ford s max has the theme of steering 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.620
 However, not only praise caused 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.299
 small minus of my page for that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.190
 Steering wheel that is good in the hand 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.810
 It has plenty of buttons and there find 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.519
 I could have solved that more elegantly 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.500
 with fewer controls it is 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 easy to understand things 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.970
 Ford also has that way 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 properly put in the mold around the new s 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.380
 max for the competition of the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.420
 to arm families up to seven 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.459
 percent more economical and exhaust poorer 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.700
 the two petrol engines have become with 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.970
 160 and 240 ps as well as the four 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.940
 diesel engines with 120 to 210 ps 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.829
 our test car has the two-liter 180 hp 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.780
 diesel on board the whole coupled with 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.070
 a six-speed manual transmission with it are 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.560
 We are really agile and fast on the way 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.700
 be 40 good I personally would 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.260
 the double coup 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.709
 order that just fits better 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.709
 vehicle 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.700
 the new ford s-max is just like his 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.190
 predecessor very spacious and for one 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.920
 extremely agile on the way there is the base 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.930
 already for 30,000 150 euro 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.790
 thanks to seven sit a sensible 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.500
 engine pallet and much more technical 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.120
 and also security features he is 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.180
 certainly the perfect family with 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.519
 head from september 2015 the ford rolls 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.849
 s-max in second generation on ours 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.849
 roads
