 otherwise called citrus and shrimp 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.840
 first of all, that crane seems to me 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.530
 winter are seasonal fruits therefore 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.720
 they are easy to find common usage 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.290
 and risotto because we are in the land of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.290
 rice organs 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.720
 is wrong and we played a little with 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.470
 the shrimp that gives you that touch 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 exotic 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.710

 half an onion for the sauce is a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.470
 secret ingredient 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.619
 let our shrimp soak 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.630
 with a little white wine the juice of the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 fruits that we find inside is the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.560
 fruit often in the meantime we have 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.220
 obviously prepared the onion for the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 We have previously removed the fried 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.690
 a bit of zest from the citrus fruits we will go 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.070
 to use after the during the phase of 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.840
 We start with our onion 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.440
 we ask immediately to insert in our 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440
 baking tin 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.090

 let's go and massage a little like it 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.000
 say to me we complete obviously with the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.770
 White wine 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 sometimes a tina mix without 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.550
 stress it 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.010
 but more or less half cooked we go to 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.010
 add our shrimp 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.570
 the same way a moment later 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.480
 let's add the peel of the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.960
 citrus fruit that we have previously is 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.960
 born 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.910
 here we go to complete the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:11.140
 our rice with saffron than in addition to 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.780
 giving it color gives you that oriental touch 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.000
 and we play at home with the east 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.190
 let's say there is some distant 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.790
 my dad and iranian then what 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.710

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.360
 the sweet taste of saffron with the 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.560
 citrus optic marr an agreement 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.990
 cane sugar above precisely from 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.690
