00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.759
 I will explain how it is installed with the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.410
 new installer the new launcher of 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.350
 minecraft we are going to come to start 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.540
 let's write app data percentage 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.489
 percentage we're going to go to the folder 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.570
 point minecraft here to the folder 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.550
 version and in this that is 1.6 point 2 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 that is, the normal profile we are going to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.290
 copy let's make a copy and then 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.300
 we're going to rename it for example I'm going 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.300
 to put low bar opti fine fine no 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.970
 opted to find vale I'm going to copy the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.970
 name here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.590
 let's put the same opti find 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.620
 and quickly in this file in the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.900
 executable point yesterday too 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.760
 and now in this Jayson we are going to open it 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.300
 with a notepad you are going to open with 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.770
 notebook and here where he puts and we go 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.230
 to also put the same name as 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.700
 we have put 1.6 point 2 low bar 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.200
 optimize you can put the name 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.510
 that you want, we are going to give 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.080
 save and we're going to go back 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 now yes in the point file and now 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.970
 let's open it with winrar 7 zip or 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.970
 any other compressor 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.710
 I will bring it here and while we are going to 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.170
 delete the meta folder and we will open 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 the opti fine file that we have here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.659
 control 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.659
 all the files and we're going to paste them 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.770
 they would be stuck together and we would have 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.870
 optimal installed but before you follow 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.450
 I will explain how to install it too 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.039
 with forge because if we want to use motorcycles 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.200
 It is worth doing a little thing 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.590
 different as you see I already have forge 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 installed that is 779 and jay without 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 tutorial how to install forge the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.970
 truth is that it is very simple then 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.310
 what we have to do now is 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 we enter here to forges and where he puts the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.870
 this executable hard file is to say 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.280
 file be executable let's do 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.220
 open with winrar 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.530
 let's reopen forge to see that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.510
 I close this very well we are going to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.530
 return again to delete the meta folder 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.300
 and we are going to open optimize and again 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 let's copy all the files worth 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.290
 what is different will be after 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.890
 let's see we are going to accept 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.010
 again we would be going to close these 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.959
 these files too and we're going to 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.959
 run minecraft the new launcher 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.599
 very well as you see we have two profiles 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.790
 if we want to use opti find without mods 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.440
 we are going to give new profile a new profile 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.920
 let's put here the name that 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.340
 we want 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.989
 for example opti find and here in using 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.440
 version we will have to select 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.970
 this Israeli 1.6 point two optics worth 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.430
 or the name we gave him 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.430
 we are going to select and we would give 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.200
 follow profile is valid so let's go 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.290
 select we have already created the profile 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.090
 let's select and find we're going to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.090
 block pear dancing 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.799
 gmail.com and password 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.900
 and we're going to give it to play now it's going to take 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.300
 a little bit more are going to be 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.810
 downloading all the files is ok but 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.060
 you see it's pretty fast 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.860
 without the player already had another created here 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.510
 world before 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.510
 so we'll use the same 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 very well, as you can see, we would have 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.730
 here optic installed and now I give to 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.620
 default control key you know 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.020
 they tell us in optics and the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.420
 zoom we would have it here if we go to 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.910
 options in video settings we are going to have 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.790
 all of these options here put the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.410
 details the smoothing of light the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.180
 We can also add animations 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.410
 each as in the way we want 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.980
 we also have the load of youngs 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.630
 Multi-core default or smoothed vale 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.060
 among other things we have here also 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.510
 the smoothing performance as I say 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.180
 the burden of the world is worth many things like that 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.790
 that as we see that it is already installed 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 here I'm going to leave and I'm going to 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 teach now using forge very well 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.370
 now let's use active and with forge 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.500
 As you can see, we had installed it here 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.180
 but we're going to have to do one thing to 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.940
 jess we have to edit the profile 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.710
 worth the name we can leave the same 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.160
 release too but we're going to have to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.340
 change here 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.950
 in advanced java properties 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.860
 we are going to apply and here we are going to have to 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.220
 put directly this sentence valeri 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.540
 where fml point ignore patch apologize 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.930
 if it's the same as true it's worth and we're going to give it 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.090
 to follow profile and now how it puts us 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.250
 play off line we are going to leave the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.250
 pitcher or if we're not going to golf 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.410
 It's very good, we have here 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.710
 our world of forge minecraft 1.6 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.479
 point 2 the 779 version forge and 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.940
 we also have optics where you see it 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.540
 what is here put is worth if in the 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.979
 player 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.500
 we can give it again to create new 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.500
 creative world and create 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.790
 Well, as you can see, it's already here if 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.130
 we give the control letter we can do it 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.320
 the zoom if we give it here again to 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.150
 options in video properties 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.160
 we have all the options that 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.020
 I have commented before it softens light load 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.330
 of chance it is worth putting the animations 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.220
 details a little to our liking we can 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.290
 also raise the fps much more 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.960
 We can also do more distance 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.290
 more much more distance than in the 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.730
 normal minecraft is worth so good 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.780
 seen this we see that it works 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.820
 correctly opti fine both just as 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.680
 with forge so I do not expect anything 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.650
 I liked it if you have any doubt 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.120
 you comment, I will try to resolve it and 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.680
 as I say see you in the next 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.680
 video is worth until later
