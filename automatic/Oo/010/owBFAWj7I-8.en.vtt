judge this series on its own merits

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
judge this series on its own merits
which<00:01:23.610> seems<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.299> having<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.600> lot<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> fun

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
which seems to be having a lot of fun

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440 
which seems to be having a lot of fun
and<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.549> having<00:01:26.820> fun<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> whole

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and sort of just having fun with a whole

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
and sort of just having fun with a whole
Gundam<00:01:27.900> mythos<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.340> pretty

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
Gundam mythos and I think it's pretty

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
Gundam mythos and I think it's pretty
obvious<00:01:29.610> by<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> end<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> episode<00:01:30.770> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
obvious by the end of this episode that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
obvious by the end of this episode that
bellary<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> join<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.210> Pirates

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bellary is going to join the Pirates

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.120 
bellary is going to join the Pirates
with<00:01:33.780> ida<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> looks<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
with ida and then it looks like the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
with ida and then it looks like the
capital<00:01:35.549> army<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.939> probably<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> end<00:01:36.450> up

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
capital army is probably going to end up

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
capital army is probably going to end up
being<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> main<00:01:37.229> antagonist<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.250> story

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
being the main antagonist of the story

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.130 
being the main antagonist of the story
and<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.600> interesting<00:01:40.079> because

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and I think that's interesting because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.539 
and I think that's interesting because

another<00:03:20.910> great<00:03:21.120> episode<00:03:21.270> that<00:03:21.810> was

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
another great episode that was

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.750 
another great episode that was
definitely<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.650> pretty<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.160> look<00:03:23.310> at<00:03:23.490> but

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
definitely very pretty to look at but

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.270 
definitely very pretty to look at but
still<00:03:24.360> kind<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.020> confusing<00:03:25.650> us<00:03:25.740> what's<00:03:25.950> really

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
still kind of confusing us what's really

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
still kind of confusing us what's really
going<00:03:26.550> on<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:26.880> they're<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.180> really

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
going on because they're not really

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.750 
going on because they're not really
explaining<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:28.050> much<00:03:28.290> about<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.070> world<00:03:29.400> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
explaining too much about the world in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.730 
explaining too much about the world in
the<00:03:29.880> lore<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:30.990> place<00:03:31.110> seems<00:03:31.590> like

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
the lore of this place seems like

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.140 
the lore of this place seems like
they're<00:03:31.860> gonna<00:03:31.980> reveal<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.460> little<00:03:32.970> by<00:03:33.120> little

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
they're gonna reveal it little by little

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.570 
they're gonna reveal it little by little
and<00:03:33.690> apparently<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.620> show<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.430> run

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
and apparently this show is going to run

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.280 
and apparently this show is going to run
for<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.820> little<00:03:35.880> while<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> can<00:03:36.870> understand

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
for a little while so I can understand

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
for a little while so I can understand
if<00:03:37.380> they're<00:03:37.470> gonna<00:03:37.560> hold<00:03:37.830> back<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
if they're gonna hold back on that and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.590 
if they're gonna hold back on that and
they<00:03:38.550> want<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.850> give<00:03:38.970> us<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.240> more<00:03:39.330> room

they want to give us a little more room

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.540 
they want to give us a little more room
for<00:03:39.810> character<00:03:40.170> development<00:03:40.370> although<00:03:41.370> there

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
for character development although there

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.490 
for character development although there
really<00:03:41.580> wasn't<00:03:41.910> too<00:03:42.240> much<00:03:42.540> from<00:03:42.810> bellary<00:03:43.320> this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500

like big goofy expression its eyes got
real<00:04:32.430> big<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.000> just<00:04:33.150> seems<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.569> ridiculous

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
real big and it just seems so ridiculous

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.080 
real big and it just seems so ridiculous
and<00:04:34.259> it<00:04:34.650> kind<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:35.009> took<00:04:35.190> me<00:04:35.400> out<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.669> moment

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
and it kind of took me out of the moment

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.400 
and it kind of took me out of the moment
for<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.270> bit<00:04:36.419> especially<00:04:36.870> because<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.199> next

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
for a bit especially because the next

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.439 
for a bit especially because the next
scene<00:04:37.710> was<00:04:38.280> followed<00:04:38.729> by<00:04:38.849> realistic

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
scene was followed by realistic

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.390 
scene was followed by realistic
crocodiles<00:04:39.930> jumping<00:04:40.470> into<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.830> water<00:04:40.860> but

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
crocodiles jumping into the water but

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580 
crocodiles jumping into the water but
whatever<00:04:42.180> that's<00:04:42.419> literally<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.139> nitpick

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
whatever that's literally just a nitpick

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.469 
whatever that's literally just a nitpick
on<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:44.160> week's<00:04:44.370> episode<00:04:44.490> which<00:04:45.030> just<00:04:45.360> like

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470

might not even like the old school
character<00:04:53.009> designs<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.669> love<00:04:54.330> them<00:04:54.509> because

I'm<00:04:54.990> an<00:04:55.110> old-school<00:04:55.380> fan<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.979> Gundam<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
I'm an old-school fan of Gundam and

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.879 
I'm an old-school fan of Gundam and
especially<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.630> original<00:04:58.139> series<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.650> know

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
especially the original series I know

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.950 
especially the original series I know
it's<00:04:59.220> kind<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.460> cliché<00:04:59.699> to<00:05:00.180> say<00:05:00.539> that<00:05:00.870> the

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
it's kind of cliché to say that the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.320 
it's kind of cliché to say that the
first<00:05:01.259> was<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.710> best<00:05:01.949> but<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.639> really<00:05:02.820> was<00:05:03.060> it

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
first was the best but it really was it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.909 
first was the best but it really was it
really<00:05:03.690> set<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> standard<00:05:04.530> for<00:05:04.560> what<00:05:04.740> these

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
really set the standard for what these

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.830 
really set the standard for what these
stories<00:05:05.310> are<00:05:05.340> going<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.759> be<00:05:05.849> about<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.389> really

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
stories are going to be about and really

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.089 
stories are going to be about and really
I<00:05:06.990> think<00:05:07.229> this<00:05:07.320> series<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.830> going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.039> be

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
I think this series is going to be

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.110 
I think this series is going to be

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
new mobile suits I still want to see a

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.200 
new mobile suits I still want to see a
lot<00:06:07.620> more<00:06:07.650> from<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.159> Gundam<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.669> G<00:06:08.880> self

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
lot more from the Gundam the G self

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.760 
lot more from the Gundam the G self
because<00:06:09.659> it<00:06:09.870> didn't<00:06:10.020> really<00:06:10.139> do<00:06:10.320> much<00:06:10.469> in<00:06:10.650> this

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
because it didn't really do much in this

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.950 
because it didn't really do much in this
episode<00:06:11.009> aside<00:06:11.340> from<00:06:11.759> walk<00:06:12.090> out<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.479> fly<00:06:12.719> out

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
episode aside from walk out and fly out

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.420 
episode aside from walk out and fly out
but<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.590> did<00:06:13.650> have<00:06:13.860> this<00:06:13.949> move<00:06:14.190> where<00:06:14.370> it

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
but it did have this move where it

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.070 
but it did have this move where it
created<00:06:14.759> this<00:06:14.820> like<00:06:15.000> magnetic<00:06:15.389> force<00:06:15.810> field

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
created this like magnetic force field

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.749 
created this like magnetic force field
that<00:06:16.199> went<00:06:16.440> around<00:06:16.590> its<00:06:16.800> body<00:06:17.039> for<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.340> second

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
that went around its body for a second

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.730 
that went around its body for a second
and<00:06:17.940> you<00:06:18.479> know<00:06:18.599> we've<00:06:19.050> seen<00:06:19.259> that<00:06:19.380> stuff<00:06:19.590> in

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
and you know we've seen that stuff in

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.050 
and you know we've seen that stuff in
gonna<00:06:19.919> before<00:06:20.280> but<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.520> still<00:06:20.699> think<00:06:20.909> it<00:06:21.030> needs

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
gonna before but I still think it needs

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.820 
gonna before but I still think it needs
more<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.479> a<00:06:21.539> gimmick<00:06:21.840> to<00:06:21.960> make<00:06:22.080> it<00:06:22.199> special<00:06:22.440> and

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
more of a gimmick to make it special and

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.770 
more of a gimmick to make it special and
if<00:06:23.370> you<00:06:23.490> guys<00:06:23.669> watch<00:06:23.909> the<00:06:24.120> ending<00:06:24.539> in<00:06:24.690> the

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
if you guys watch the ending in the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.600 
if you guys watch the ending in the
intro<00:06:25.169> they<00:06:25.650> definitely<00:06:25.979> show<00:06:26.280> that<00:06:26.490> it<00:06:26.580> is

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
intro they definitely show that it is

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.459 
intro they definitely show that it is
going<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.030> get<00:06:27.150> some<00:06:27.330> upgrades<00:06:27.780> it's<00:06:28.020> just<00:06:28.380> a

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.469 
going to get some upgrades it's just a

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.170 
going to get some upgrades it's just a
matter<00:06:28.680> of<00:06:28.800> time<00:06:28.919> this<00:06:29.340> is<00:06:29.520> how<00:06:29.610> gun<00:06:29.849> and<00:06:30.000> works

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
matter of time this is how gun and works

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.459 
matter of time this is how gun and works
if<00:06:30.330> this<00:06:30.449> is<00:06:30.570> going<00:06:30.659> to<00:06:30.750> be<00:06:30.810> a<00:06:30.870> 50<00:06:31.139> episode

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
if this is going to be a 50 episode

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.260 
if this is going to be a 50 episode
series<00:06:31.740> we'll<00:06:32.370> probably<00:06:32.550> see<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.030> first

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
series we'll probably see the first

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.779 
series we'll probably see the first
upgrade<00:06:33.479> around<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.080> 20<00:06:34.409> to<00:06:34.650> 30<00:06:34.979> episode<00:06:35.460> mark

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:38.930 
if it's only at 25 we'll see it in

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
probably another 10

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.760 
probably another 10
episodes<00:06:39.330> maybe<00:06:39.690> we'll<00:06:39.960> be<00:06:40.110> at<00:06:40.200> surprising

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770

really high quality it's still just a

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.880 
really high quality it's still just a
little<00:06:47.670> confusing<00:06:48.330> people<00:06:49.050> who<00:06:49.320> are<00:06:49.500> used<00:06:49.800> to

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
especially like the terms they use but

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.940
