today<00:00:19.619> monday<00:00:20.160> i'm<00:00:20.310> trying<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:20.850> format<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
today monday i'm trying a new format and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.790 
today monday i'm trying a new format and
that<00:00:21.689> new<00:00:21.810> format<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.650> actually

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that new format is that I'm actually

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
that new format is that I'm actually
standing<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.609> feel<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.180> could<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
standing I feel like this could be a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
standing I feel like this could be a
little<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.439> engaging<00:00:25.769> gives<00:00:26.099> me<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
little bit more engaging gives me a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.650 
little bit more engaging gives me a
little<00:00:26.340> bit<00:00:26.490> more<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.760> range<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> motion<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
little bit more of a range of motion I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
little bit more of a range of motion I
can<00:00:28.050> stand<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.859> need<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.789> move

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
can stand back if I need to I can move

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
can stand back if I need to I can move
forward<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.109> makes<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> lot<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.560> sense

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
forward it just makes a lot more sense

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
forward it just makes a lot more sense
I've<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.399> shifted<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.090> webcam<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.809> bit

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I've also shifted my webcam a little bit

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
I've also shifted my webcam a little bit
higher<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.460> hopefully<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.760> works<00:00:36.000> out

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
higher so hopefully this all works out

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
higher so hopefully this all works out
if<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> doesn't<00:00:36.809> try<00:00:37.170> something<00:00:37.620> new<00:00:38.000> moving

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
if it doesn't try something new moving

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
if it doesn't try something new moving
