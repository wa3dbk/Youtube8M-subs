00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
native resolution of the screen so we

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.119 
native resolution of the screen so we
will<00:03:41.910> get<00:03:42.209> these<00:03:42.450> black<00:03:42.840> areas<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.890> top

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.100 
will get these black areas of the top
and<00:03:44.370> bottom<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.360> screen<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:48.540> game<00:03:48.750> gives

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
and bottom of the screen this game gives

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.280 
and bottom of the screen this game gives
me<00:03:49.379> roughly<00:03:50.069> about<00:03:50.129> 30<00:03:50.580> FPS<00:03:51.180> every<00:03:51.480> time<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> try

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
it feels responsible and everything so
