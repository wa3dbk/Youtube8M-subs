call felt traffic what do we got what's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
call felt traffic what do we got what's
really<00:01:03.239> acting<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.080> scene<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.909> two<00:01:06.450> parts

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
really acting a scene in in two parts

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
really acting a scene in in two parts
the<00:01:07.260> motion<00:01:07.650> capture<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> motion

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the motion capture and then the motion

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.320 
the motion capture and then the motion
scanning<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.890> motion<00:01:11.189> capture<00:01:11.520> captures<00:01:12.210> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
scanning the motion capture captures all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
scanning the motion capture captures all
the<00:01:12.360> body<00:01:12.600> movements<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> where<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.830> look

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the body movements and where people look

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.460 
the body movements and where people look
so<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> gives<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.119> lines

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
so it gives you a little do lines

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.030 
so it gives you a little do lines
regulator<00:01:16.470> valve<00:01:16.880> good<00:01:17.880> fine<00:01:18.259> then<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
regulator valve good fine then we can

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.649 
regulator valve good fine then we can
move<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.700> studio<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> where<00:01:21.330> an

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
move up to this studio and where an

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.810 
move up to this studio and where an
actor<00:01:21.990> typically<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.759> the

actor typically going to make up in the
morning<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> had<00:01:24.780> their<00:01:24.990> hair<00:01:25.170> done

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
morning and then it had their hair done

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
morning and then it had their hair done
in<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> 1940's<00:01:26.100> hairstyle<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.509> come

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
in a 1940's hairstyle then they come

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.850 
in a 1940's hairstyle then they come
into<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> room<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> sit<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> seat<00:01:28.829> behind

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
into a room and sit in the seat behind

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550 
into a room and sit in the seat behind
me<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> rig<00:01:30.630> does<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> capture<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
me and what the rig does is capture a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.399 
me and what the rig does is capture a
volume<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.689> you've<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.869> cameras

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
volume around them you've got cameras

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.520 
volume around them you've got cameras
not<00:01:34.680> only<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> looking<00:01:37.140> upward

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
not only around but also looking upward

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.070 
not only around but also looking upward
and<00:01:37.770> downward<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.520> well<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> move

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
and downward as well so any kind of move

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.930 
and downward as well so any kind of move
is<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.040> cut<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
is going to cut out some of the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.720 
is going to cut out some of the
information<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.220> delivered<00:01:44.640> their

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
information and they delivered their

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.280 
information and they delivered their
lines<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.660> talk<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:46.110> get

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
lines and as they talk they get

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.390 
lines and as they talk they get
processed<00:01:47.010> in<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.490> 3d<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.560> action<00:01:49.560> so
