00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
silver side and a black side so when you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.220 
silver side and a black side so when you
are<00:00:22.730> shooting<00:00:24.740> you<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> camera<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
are shooting you put into the camera you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.359 
are shooting you put into the camera you
slide<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:29.449> take<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> picture<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.410> then

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
slide it out take a picture and then

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.799 
slide it out take a picture and then
when<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> flip<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.910> black<00:00:42.180> which

when you flip it over it's black which

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
when you flip it over it's black which
means<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.620> exposed<00:00:44.070> mm-hmm

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
