00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and then guys okay with you that such 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.470
 a flash tell you today that you do not 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 has inside the workshop 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.910
 I will not pass up a tip 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
 Nice to you and mostly have a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.179
 flex car 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 now more expensive gasoline 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 Look at this time a little colder. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 Do you remember a very 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 forgotten in the car, right? 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.109
 It's our cold starting kit. 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 a gasoline tank 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 A lot of people end up forgetting about this. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 component fails to give the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 proper maintenance of placing 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 quality of being aware of the validity 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 gasoline and what happens when I show 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.480
 To you, here is a fiat siena. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 cold start will 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.440
 Here the plastic shield in the box here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.949
 of the paralama wheel and here after 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.260
 removed 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.890
 we have here the famous tanquinho and the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 most common defects are rotting 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.070
 of gasoline inside it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 then who happens to be 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 event it ends up harming the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 pump because it has a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.159
 electric fire pump here that ends 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 locking with the dirt gasoline turned 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 a type of hockey bomb cracks that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.229
 leaks may appear on the trim and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 This is all because of the old gasoline, right? 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.430
 then begins to leak into hoses 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.869
 starts to leak in cover locks the engine 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.329
 cracks and starts to appear too. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.950
 so many people forgetting our 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.960
 care little nÃ© 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 a tip I give you is not even 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.270
 you second line of you wahda is to use 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 a premium gasoline a gasoline podium 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 a gasoline that has a lower content of 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.710
 sulfur in higher quality gasoline 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 which has an expiry date with a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.740
 little bigger 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.229
 ordinary gasoline it wins more 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 quickly and ultimately damages the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 system then what are you going to do in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.729
 time for you your starting tantrum to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.619
 cold 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.079
 I prefer a gasoline of the type can a 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.689
 tabu it will last longer than 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.399
 six months for you to have an idea 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.000
