00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.170 
time I have left over at the end of the
level<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.260> put<00:03:02.530> into<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.770> pool<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.489> draw

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
level it's put into a pool that I draw

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.130 
level it's put into a pool that I draw
from<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.959> level<00:03:05.860> five<00:03:06.239> because<00:03:07.239> one<00:03:07.900> area<00:03:08.200> has

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
from on level five because one area has

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.690 
from on level five because one area has
five<00:03:11.140> different<00:03:11.560> levels<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.340> fifth

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
five different levels to if the fifth

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.250 
five different levels to if the fifth
level<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:13.120> go<00:03:13.239> on<00:03:13.390> forever<00:03:13.630> as<00:03:13.900> long<00:03:13.930> as<00:03:14.170> you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
level can go on forever as long as you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.759 
level can go on forever as long as you
actually<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.800> much<00:03:14.980> time<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
actually have that much time so the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.190 
actually have that much time so the
object<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.670> clear<00:03:18.940> earlier<00:03:19.870> levels

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
object is just a clear earlier levels

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.120 
object is just a clear earlier levels
and<00:03:20.800> waves<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:21.519> quickly<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:22.030> possible<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:24.010> is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and waves as quickly as possible this is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
and waves as quickly as possible this is
championship<00:03:24.880> mode<00:03:25.030> one<00:03:25.269> interesting<00:03:25.540> thing

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
championship mode one interesting thing

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.800 
championship mode one interesting thing
is<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.140> on<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.650> fifth<00:03:27.130> level<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:28.180> each<00:03:28.570> area

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
is that on the fifth level of each area

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.860 
is that on the fifth level of each area
and<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.500> first<00:03:29.709> level<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.040> championship<00:03:30.640> mode

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
and the first level of championship mode

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.229 
and the first level of championship mode
you<00:03:31.870> actually<00:03:32.500> get<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:33.130> bunch<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.670> enemy<00:03:34.000> ships

horde of ships is now following me

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.690 
horde of ships is now following me
around<00:03:45.250> momentarily<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:48.130> looks<00:03:48.280> really<00:03:48.430> cool

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
around momentarily it looks really cool

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.660 
around momentarily it looks really cool
at<00:03:48.820> first<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.510> they<00:03:49.840> die<00:03:50.050> super<00:03:50.739> quickly<00:03:51.040> so

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
at first but they die super quickly so

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.090 
at first but they die super quickly so
you<00:03:52.660> know<00:03:52.780> really<00:03:52.959> if<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.380> gameplay<00:03:53.830> very

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
you know really if that gameplay very

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.300 
you know really if that gameplay very
much

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.349 

the<00:03:59.310> other<00:03:59.430> thing<00:03:59.609> I<00:03:59.670> wanted<00:03:59.879> to<00:03:59.939> talk<00:04:00.090> about

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the other thing I wanted to talk about

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.899 
the other thing I wanted to talk about
in<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.569> review<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:02.250> control

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
in this review is the control

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.880 
in this review is the control
specifically<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.780> movement<00:04:04.170> controls<00:04:04.560> are

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
specifically the movement controls are

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
specifically the movement controls are
just<00:04:05.340> really<00:04:06.180> bad<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.239> hard<00:04:09.420> to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
just really bad it's kind of hard to

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.819 
just really bad it's kind of hard to
show<00:04:09.719> this<00:04:09.870> off<00:04:10.079> but<00:04:10.469> as<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:10.920> see<00:04:12.829> they're

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
show this off but as you can see they're

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.219 
show this off but as you can see they're
just<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.370> not<00:04:14.639> precise<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.599> wherever<00:04:16.109> I

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
just really not precise and wherever I

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.779 
just really not precise and wherever I
like<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.769> put<00:04:16.949> my<00:04:16.979> thumb<00:04:17.250> down<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.759> the

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
like if I put my thumb down here on the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.270 
like if I put my thumb down here on the
left<00:04:18.139> automatically<00:04:19.139> starts<00:04:19.500> moving<00:04:19.799> my<00:04:19.859> ship

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
left automatically starts moving my ship

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.439 
left automatically starts moving my ship
and<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.940> mean<00:04:21.209> which<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.910> know<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.120> can't

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
and I mean which you know you can't

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.939 
and I mean which you know you can't
predict<00:04:24.810> which<00:04:25.020> way<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.350> ship<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.889> to

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
predict which way the ship is going to

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.029 
predict which way the ship is going to
move<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.139> have<00:04:28.259> to<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.560> kind<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.800> keep

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
move so you have to just kind of keep

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.100 
move so you have to just kind of keep
your<00:04:29.190> thumb<00:04:29.430> down<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.940> drag<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.479> around<00:04:30.570> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
your thumb down and drag it around a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.680 
your thumb down and drag it around a
bunch<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:32.580> doesn't<00:04:32.940> work<00:04:33.060> right<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.360> really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
bunch just doesn't work right I really

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.450 
bunch just doesn't work right I really
hope<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.229> patrols<00:04:34.650> get<00:04:34.919> improved<00:04:35.190> with<00:04:35.370> a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
hope the patrols get improved with a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.520 
hope the patrols get improved with a
patch<00:04:35.669> because<00:04:36.090> as<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.509> stands<00:04:37.050> there<00:04:37.410> are

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
patch because as it stands there are

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.379 
patch because as it stands there are
some<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.830> worst<00:04:37.949> controls<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.789> any<00:04:39.150> phone

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
some of the worst controls of any phone

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.360 
some of the worst controls of any phone
game<00:04:39.570> I've<00:04:39.720> ever<00:04:39.870> played<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:44.039> only<00:04:44.220> other

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
first place that's just not a terrific

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.250 
first place that's just not a terrific
value<00:05:04.490> still<00:05:05.490> there<00:05:06.389> is<00:05:06.419> fun<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.810> be<00:05:06.900> had<00:05:07.050> with

value still there is fun to be had with

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.409 
value still there is fun to be had with
it<00:05:07.409> if<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.740> get<00:05:08.039> used<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.460> controls<00:05:08.909> and

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
it if you get used to the controls and
