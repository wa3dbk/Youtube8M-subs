00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello how about androids 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.940
 today I'm bringing you a new tutorial 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.299
 for 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.299
 flip the memory of hesperia j 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.570
 flip the memory of the xperia j 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560
 to do this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 only 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 we are going to adjust 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.289
 and some let's see here where it says 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.289
 Applications 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.559
 they give you up here where it says internal 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 there we are where it says internal 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.140
 and they are going to check do not have palomeadas 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.890
 no box that were here in the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 orillite 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 to the right and there I have this now 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.380
 palomeadas but you should have no 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 any 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 at least yes 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.480
 then they do not eliminate us like you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.530
 want but if you do not have to put 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.530
 inmate 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.170
 because if you can not erase them 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.170
 or not work what we're going to do 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.740
 now they must be super users 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.740
 users 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 super users to explore and their 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 process me to make this this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200
 tutorial 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.549
 So, well, let's open the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.549
 explorer 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.460
 the road explorer 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 we're going to give you here to the bottom where 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.720
 says system 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.060
 system 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.010
 and then they go to find the one that says the tc 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.049
 etc here I have it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.049
 I 'm just going to click 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 and it gives more work 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.170
 down we have one that says bolt bolt 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.970
 efe 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 how can you tell me I have 2 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 the one that says below that says bolt point f 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.879
 c 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.100
 such a point is this as the copy of 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.680
 security 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.110
 it is done by default they do not have to be from 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.220
 carry affection when you are going to be 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.220
 we are going to edit it 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 before editing you pay him up here 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.459
 so that he talks to them but probably not 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.110
 I open them where they say ride as hereu 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.140
 w they will leave it in the w 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.480
 and now if you leave the flat you 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.480
 they release to the first option 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.320
 where it says open the text editor 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.510
 and that's not all 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.330
 they are fixed here where it says it was ruled out 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.370
 who says this and says it sd card 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.950
 and then it goes further down also 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.950
 says ex cat 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.740
 and then it's a kart if you're going to 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 have this backwards that says of ex low 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.420
 You will have it here, selector says 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.750
 want it from Carlos a theory work in 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.750
 the two 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.690
 and I will open to do the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.670
 demonstration 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.790
 here I make a backup I go to 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.790
 do 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.230
 they give in opening a text editor 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.040
 we are going to edit it 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.650
 just like this 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.829
 they keep him indoor I'm going to put that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.829
 day 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.350
 but it's better that way so they do not look 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.350
 so much 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.639
 and already when it says where it was when approaching 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.830
 they will give 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.870
 then giving of cd they put ex 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.000
 as was the above 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.900
 cat 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.900
 equally here 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.789
 ext 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.789
 and a kart glass 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.590
 let out 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.400
 changes were made and then put that 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.550
 not because I have it you give it to you 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.550
 yes 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.729
 only what they have to do is they go 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.779
 to turn off your phone 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.779
 and they relearn it 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.909
 it's all they have to do 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.160
 and since you can not take it 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.360
 by good roth breeze 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.759
 since now in the rock 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.759
 this 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:46.650
 they are going to go to the external 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.650
 that used to be a flashlight 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.069
 and then to swim 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.160
 multiple choice 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.160
 select all copy 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.810
 and his returns 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.169
 and look for the headquarters 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.860
 that was previously the external one and they are going to give 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.629
 in pasting 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.879
 the existing element I have it 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.680
 you do not have it they are going to give you 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.460
 who to do this with all the 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.000
 elements and combine what combine and already 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.970
 this 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.310
 and so that this so that all of us 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.160
 your applications and all are going to 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.340
 move 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.240
 external that is already the internal havana of 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.970
 your experience 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.120
 and washing machine to cancel and be it 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.590
 better it takes a lot if you have 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.990
 some game and everything because they also come out 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.900
 the data then since I do this and 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.330
 I recommend that the data 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.849
 game then after that I do go to the 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.229
 they can eliminate from their list who 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.669
 the internal two gigas to create the 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.240
 space and also can follow 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.990
 using 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.169
 well this friends nothing that's all 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:12.410
 if they served what they say if they want 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:17.180
 enter a tutorial for as a router 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:19.930
 susper and aj just leave the comments 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.930
 until seen
