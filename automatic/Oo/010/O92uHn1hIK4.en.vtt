00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
alright guys so we're gonna do a little

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.059 
alright guys so we're gonna do a little
bit<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.300> tutorial<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.350> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> drive

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
bit of a tutorial here on how to drive

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.450 
bit of a tutorial here on how to drive
with<00:00:05.250> paddle<00:00:05.640> shifters<00:00:07.069> so<00:00:08.069> as<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.400> see

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
with paddle shifters so as you can see

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.299 
with paddle shifters so as you can see
here<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> paddles<00:00:09.889> most<00:00:10.889> cars<00:00:11.219> have

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
here we have the paddles most cars have

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.589 
here we have the paddles most cars have
the<00:00:11.580> plus<00:00:12.170> sign<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:14.639> plus<00:00:15.000> paddle<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the plus sign or the plus paddle on the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.990 
the plus sign or the plus paddle on the
right<00:00:15.809> side<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> left<00:00:16.650> paddle<00:00:17.340> they

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
right side and the left paddle they

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.590 
right side and the left paddle they
wrote<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.390> -<00:00:19.020> paddle<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> left<00:00:20.010> side<00:00:20.600> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
wrote a - paddle on the left side of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.890 
wrote a - paddle on the left side of
course<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.460> unless<00:00:23.600> it<00:00:24.600> might<00:00:24.810> be

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
course you know unless it might be

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.540 
course you know unless it might be
pretty<00:00:25.140> obvious<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.769> some<00:00:25.949> people<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.400> if

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pretty obvious for some people but if

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
pretty obvious for some people but if
you<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.300> course<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> plot<00:00:28.019> means

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you don't know of course it plot means

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
you don't know of course it plot means
when<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.220> top<00:00:29.550> shifting<00:00:29.990> down

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
when you're up top shifting down

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.350 
when you're up top shifting down
shifting<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> -<00:00:33.559> other<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
shifting is a - other than that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.560 
shifting is a - other than that
basically<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.000> concept<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.540> pretty

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
basically this the concept is pretty

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.940 
basically this the concept is pretty
much<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.469> driving<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> stick<00:00:41.399> shift<00:00:41.460> car<00:00:42.950> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
much like driving a stick shift car you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.970 
much like driving a stick shift car you
don't<00:00:44.129> need<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.660> clutch<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.710> clutch

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
don't need to clutch or use a clutch

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.180 
don't need to clutch or use a clutch
that's<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.610> only<00:00:47.820> difference

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
that's the only difference

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
that's the only difference
:<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> same<00:00:50.940> concept<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:52.350> know

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
: and that is the same concept you know

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680 
: and that is the same concept you know
basically<00:00:52.920> once<00:00:53.309> once<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> feel<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.300> need

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
basically once once you feel or you need

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.490 
basically once once you feel or you need
to<00:00:55.469> achieve<00:00:55.910> either<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.420> chief<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.020> down<00:00:58.199> ship

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to achieve either up chief or down ship

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.930 
to achieve either up chief or down ship
you're<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.550> using<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you're just gonna do it by using the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
you're just gonna do it by using the
paddle<00:01:00.239> shifter<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.199> benefit<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
paddle shifter so the benefit of this is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.090 
paddle shifter so the benefit of this is
that<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.390> chieftain<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.920> from

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that when you're chieftain going from

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300 
that when you're chieftain going from
one<00:01:05.280> year<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> another<00:01:05.760> its<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.890> faster

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
one year to another its way way faster

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.080 
one year to another its way way faster
because<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> waste<00:01:10.140> time

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
because you don't have to waste time

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
because you don't have to waste time
releasing<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.810> gas<00:01:13.080> hit<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> clutch<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
releasing the the gas hit the clutch and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.649 
releasing the the gas hit the clutch and
then<00:01:15.119> she<00:01:15.420> achieved<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:17.009> down<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
then she achieved up or down it's just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
then she achieved up or down it's just
quick<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.350> automatically<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.490> soon<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
quick and automatically as soon as you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.359 
quick and automatically as soon as you
click<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.509> thing<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.560> shifting<00:01:23.250> or

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
click this thing you're up shifting or

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.429 
click this thing you're up shifting or
down<00:01:23.549> shifting<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> basic

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
down shifting on so that's not the basic

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.850 
down shifting on so that's not the basic
concept<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> guess<00:01:28.970> as<00:01:29.970> far<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.860> driving

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
concept I guess as far as the driving

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.660 
concept I guess as far as the driving
with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> paddles

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
with the paddles

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.069 
with the paddles
other<00:01:33.420> than<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.740> particular<00:01:35.189> car

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
other than that with this particular car

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
other than that with this particular car
why<00:01:37.079> we're<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> pull<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> card

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
why we're gonna do is pull the card

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
why we're gonna do is pull the card
drive<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.840> basically<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> plus

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
drive and then basically you get a plus

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.550 
drive and then basically you get a plus
or<00:01:40.950> minus<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.790> drive<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.329> these<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
or minus you can drive with these and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
or minus you can drive with these and
you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> option<00:01:44.430> option<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.869> ship<00:01:46.110> going

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you can option option or down ship going

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.569 
you can option option or down ship going
like<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.659> or<00:01:48.680> basically<00:01:49.680> use<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> paddle

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
like this or basically use the paddle

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
like this or basically use the paddle
zone<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.570> we're<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.990> start<00:01:52.290> driving<00:01:52.710> we're

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
zone so we're gonna start driving we're

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
zone so we're gonna start driving we're
gonna<00:01:52.979> pull<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> car<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.299> D<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:55.170> sorry

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gonna pull the car here on D I'm sorry

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.010 
gonna pull the car here on D I'm sorry
on<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> other<00:01:56.100> side<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.210> d<00:01:57.479> s<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
on the other side which is a d s and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.130 
on the other side which is a d s and
then<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.829> point<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.340> need<00:01:59.399> Julie<00:01:59.880> say

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
then from this point we need Julie say

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
then from this point we need Julie say

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
click here now we're on first gear and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.899 
click here now we're on first gear and
then<00:02:03.390> we're<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
then we're going to

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.349 
then we're going to
are<00:02:03.999> driving<00:02:04.420> alright<00:02:05.259> guys<00:02:05.469> so<00:02:06.179> as<00:02:07.179> I

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
are driving alright guys so as I

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.850 
are driving alright guys so as I
mentioned<00:02:07.810> before<00:02:07.840> we're<00:02:08.379> going<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.590> pull<00:02:08.769> the
