00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello youtuber welcome back my 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.469
 channel and here we are in a new video 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.720
 of five minutes dealing with 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.310
 modifiers as you will see later 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.539
 first we have to select the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.310
 player you are already seeing that we have 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.110
 of rossi and because with modifiers and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 that the truth that when the game comes out 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.859
 of rossi for example only has 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.420
 Pepsi midfielder serving as 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.939
 midfielder alone there was only one to the 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.350
 sale and why a thousand coins and then 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.699
 another defensive midfielder we have it 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.960
 that get as cheap as possible and 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.660
 like six watching up to about seven thousand 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 7500 coins we can get it very 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.170
 cheap for six thousand six thousand five hundred 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.969
 also and the first thing that you have to 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.890
 do to start doing it is about 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.960
 select a player I recommend from 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 rossi not doing it because the truth that what 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 I did with enough and they are already varied 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.609
 a little bit the price but you have 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.109
 a lot of players from midfielders 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.460
 defensive with which to select them 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.829
 works with everyone since it just came out 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.210
 recently the game and surely 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.640
 player who selects there are not many 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 mediocentros is looking for one that you are 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.089
 practically the only one that you sell us and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.530
 I started with Rossi since it's a 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.240
 player that I like very much has very 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 good pace and it looks great in any 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.020
 mediocentro injection and started with him 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.910
 doing it for about 7,000 coins 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.659
 serving and he already had two sold and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.130
 when I sold them very fast 9 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.590
 theater in the video to teach as much 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 fast possible I tell you that this trick he 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.299
 says it before the game came out is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.250
 I did it from the web and it allowed me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 start with a great team like after 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 at the end you will see after checking that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.819
 there are few midcentres to sell 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.109
 player that you have selected 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.509
 you just have to see the difference 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.009
 of prices for example of the one at the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
 sale and marginalized as I say with de 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.849
 rossi I had the one of rossi to sign 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.649
 the defensive midfielder to 7 thousand 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.450
 little coins and the first of rossi that I saw and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.060
 it was the only one was ten thousand coins 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.129
 there is a difference of three thousand coins and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 it's enough to start on the web was 

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:54.509
 much much difference 3,000 coins per 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.829
 each player 2500 that we remove ourselves already 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 that the modifier card is going to 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 cost about 1500 coins and between 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.829
 that would take us away would be about two thousand 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.989
 profit monies and then by 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.429
 I recommend that there are about 4000 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.439
 three thousand five hundred coins if we are going to 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.759
 be very effective now that a 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.649
 I play the truth that there will be more 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.849
 players surely midfielders but 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.739
 we worry about you putting it 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.269
 always in purchase and the cheapest vice 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.760
 is the first to sell it and sell it 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.170
 without scarcely a few minutes and if you are 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.300
 the only ones that you have the player 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.300
 has half a center to put the price that 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.130
 you agree not spend 25 thousand coins but 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.410
 put five thousand coins more expensive 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.330
 simply with putting a difference of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.340
 3 thousand coins from the defensive medium 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.050
 we are going to sell very fast we are 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.580
 speaking we sell it in the 30th minute 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.989
 in the 35th minute they always buy it in 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.160
 unified and you also see that I am 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.790
 doing when it does work 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 perfectly 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.720
 I did it with alonso because rossi already 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.150
 had deviated from price a little bit and already 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.850
 was between a thousand coins or something like that 11 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.410
 thousand or 12 thousand and we are buying it in 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 about 10 thousand so it no longer convinces us 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.190
 Ecuador no longer talked to us and I went to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.580
 xabi alonso and friend was great is a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.530
 pass 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.060
 right now how is the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.730
 game is in about seven thousand five hundred 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.260
 buy already defensive midfielder and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.060
 sells midfielder in about ten thousand 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 coins your profit we are already seeing 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.209
 in three thousand coins also 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.100
 it was working very well since in 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.989
 change have about 400 thousand pieces of 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.640
 benefit and can also be done with 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.010
 another type of modifiers for example 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.019
 of average md 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.360
 it is much less benefit the best among 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.129
 we took off about 1500 coins or 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.840
 well it is also very good trade or because 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.489
 since those who are starting have 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 players also cheap to start 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.239
 with midfielders as you look for 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.140
 it also works very well way like 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.500
 we are always going to do a brief review 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.600
 for 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.550
 At the beginning we have gone back to messing with 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.050
 modifiers why is it because the 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.330
 players that is the midfielder 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.770
 defensive they still do not have midfielder and 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.390
 as we are the first to change the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.490
 we are the first to also sell them 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.230
 and we will get more out of them what 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.580
 we will do in the following way we will take 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.959
 and we will select a player that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.310
 we want and that we like that 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.410
 you think that midfielder is going to sell 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.790
 and if we are the only ones who sell it, 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.560
 we have to compare prices with none 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.240
 and we have the price to 2002 to go up 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.360
 more expensive coins than what has 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.980
 side and including the modifier like 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.680
 a modifier of same cne diets that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.820
 one thousand two hundred or three hundred if what 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.020
 you want to sign in the night will go 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.180
 much better that they are much more 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.440
 cheap just applied and it is already and it would be 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.959
 a xabi alonso that has cost us in 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.830
 total about eight thousand coins and finally 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.420
 what we have to do is look 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.090
 our player in the market from which 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.799
 you have less purchase already and if you round 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.140
 three thousand beneficial coins put you 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.270
 a little less about 250 less coins 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.250
 and a few minutes will come and here and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.020
 serving the result we knew some 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.270
 ten thousand seven fifth coins about two 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.990
 thousand 700 the other about nine thousand 800 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.490
 coins and also those of rossi 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.810
 and grab watching the team that thanks 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.430
 behind ohl I got the take off 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.410
 about 65,000 coins are more or less 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.570
 now I have another time very different to 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.280
 this much better but I have started 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.140
