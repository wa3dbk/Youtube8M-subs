00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of the workshop now these are the other

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
of the workshop now these are the other
bits<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> I've<00:00:26.369> been<00:00:26.550> trying<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.210> put

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
bits that I've been trying to put

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
bits that I've been trying to put
together<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.470> rest<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
together and this is the rest of it so

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
together and this is the rest of it so
far<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.809> I've<00:00:33.899> managed<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> get

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
far as you can see I've managed to get

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
far as you can see I've managed to get
the<00:00:34.530> feet<00:00:36.050> knees<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> midsection<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the feet knees the midsection of the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.250 
the feet knees the midsection of the
body<00:00:40.940> top<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> legs<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> even<00:00:43.110> looks

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
body top of the legs and it even looks

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
body top of the legs and it even looks
like<00:00:43.350> he's<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> backside

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
like he's got a backside

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.860 
like he's got a backside
this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> top<00:00:47.010> section<00:00:47.510> part<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> top

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this is the top section part of the top

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.889 
this is the top section part of the top
section<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> effectively<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> waist

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
section which is effectively the waist

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
section which is effectively the waist
which<00:00:51.899> allows<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> bend<00:00:52.710> forwards<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
which allows it to bend forwards and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.900 
which allows it to bend forwards and
also<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.410> section<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.160> tilt<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
also the top section to tilt side to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
also the top section to tilt side to
side<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.809> I've<00:00:58.079> disconnected<00:00:58.440> because

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
side which I've disconnected because

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
side which I've disconnected because
this<00:00:59.340> section<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> modify<00:01:00.359> because

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this section I need to modify because

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.889 
this section I need to modify because
it's<00:01:01.109> way<00:01:01.469> way<00:01:01.800> too<00:01:01.859> heavy<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.719> not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it's way way too heavy and I'm not

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.320 
it's way way too heavy and I'm not
really<00:01:04.049> happy<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> design<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> that's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really happy with the design so that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
really happy with the design so that's
what<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> looks<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.229> far<00:01:07.560> over<00:01:08.040> here

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
what it looks like so far over here

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
what it looks like so far over here
sitting<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> shelf<00:01:09.510> somewhere<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> bits

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
sitting on the shelf somewhere is bits

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
sitting on the shelf somewhere is bits
of<00:01:10.710> hands<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.119> probably<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
of hands and you could probably just a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.499 
of hands and you could probably just a
make<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.920> fingers<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.640> pinched<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
make out the fingers I pinched the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
make out the fingers I pinched the
servos<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> original

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
servos out of these for the original

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
servos out of these for the original
head<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.299> why<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> servos<00:01:19.020> are

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
head so that's why the servos are

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
head so that's why the servos are
missing<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.650> I've<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.310> left

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
missing but I've got the right and left

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.440 
missing but I've got the right and left
hand<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> original<00:01:23.250> hand<00:01:23.970> design

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
hand this was the original hand design

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.490 
hand this was the original hand design
and<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.009> mounted<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:26.790> servos

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
and as you can see I mounted two servos

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.520 
and as you can see I mounted two servos
crudely<00:01:29.060> along<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> shaft<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> sort<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
crudely along the shaft here and sort of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
crudely along the shaft here and sort of
glued<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> thing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
glued them in just to get the thing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
glued them in just to get the thing
working<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.200> later<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> decided<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
working and then later on I decided to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.830 
working and then later on I decided to
mount<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.850> slightly<00:01:36.060> differently<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.630> use

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
mount them slightly differently and use

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.160 
mount them slightly differently and use
different<00:01:37.200> servers<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> hands<00:01:39.900> fully

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
different servers and but a hands fully

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
different servers and but a hands fully
functional<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.880> hung<00:01:42.180> around<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.630> my

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
functional and if you hung around on my

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.260 
functional and if you hung around on my
You<00:01:42.810> Tube<00:01:42.990> channel<00:01:43.259> you'll<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.399> hand

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
You Tube channel you'll see the hand

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.649 
You Tube channel you'll see the hand
working<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:47.549> final<00:01:48.479> look

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
working so that is it for now final look

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.039 
working so that is it for now final look
at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.640> body

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
at the body

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
at the body
I've<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.290> no<00:01:52.770> idea<00:01:53.130> whether<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
I've actually no idea whether this is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
I've actually no idea whether this is
gonna<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:54.000> able<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> walk<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.500> it's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gonna be able to walk on up because it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.179 
gonna be able to walk on up because it's
so<00:01:55.740> damn<00:01:56.070> heavy<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.320> it'll<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so damn heavy so and it'll probably just

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.240 
so damn heavy so and it'll probably just
collapse<00:01:59.640> in<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.299> heap<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> floor<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.979> it's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
collapse in a heap on the floor but it's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.880 
collapse in a heap on the floor but it's
fun<00:02:02.549> trying<00:02:02.909> anyway<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.829> now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
