00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 I always talk to colleagues or 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 Israel, I have great difficulty 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 at the time of molding at the time of passing 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.020
 that mouth information the lab 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.240
 which is a simpler way with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.730
 most appropriate way with the technique to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.420
 better technique or technique more more 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.520
 predictable and always discuss how to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
 this way better and we have stopped 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 that we accompany the kit follows and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 certainly some more 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 predictable and besides I really like 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.239
 also on this topic because it is directly 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.460
 I think dentistry aside 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.980
 didactic part has to be 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.110
 focused on the technical part and the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.739
 it directly so you can use the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.809
 parameters the rules the tips here is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 immediately our patient so hopefully 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.770
 What do you like about our chat was? 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.250
 nicely well interactive chemistry try 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 facilitate your day to day life. 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.400
 clinic 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.049
 Our big challenge is I have a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.520
 like the one I prepared for 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.170
 excellent preparation wonderful sight 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.659
 Free technical execution a beautiful 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 and the patient is satisfied 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 but that 's okay you need to transfer this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 properly inform the laboratory 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 because up there will work a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159
 another person who does not have access to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 for this you need a good assembly 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.479
 for this evil was a faithful one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.540
 management model 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.030
 the exchange is the faithful one identical to the mouth and this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 is the great secret of the assembly that my 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 final restoration than my final work 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 suits the mouth and for that I need 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.640
 have a faithful and adequate copy 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770
 It's no good preparing my 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.710
 technician is an excellent artist in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.990
 cil ceramic has a transfer 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 adequate information and transfer 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.869
 always passes through the assembly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.649
 copy of your preparation from the mouth to the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.590
 plaster 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.959
 When I think of a good shoot I think 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 always some important parameters but 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.770
 I will basically do a molding 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.300
 together three points 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.410
 I have to have a good gingival tissue 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.440
 a healthy gingival tissue is fit 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.170
 to receive the approach 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 I have to work a vision 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.110
 cervical 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540
 I have to watch my suit. 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 cervical so that the molding material 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.730
 nor can I observe, can copy this 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 cervical region and I have to work 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.960
 obviously a good molding material 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.990
 so I did not associate a gingival tissue 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.420
 without adequate ventilation . 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.400
 inflammation without bleeding 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.130
 with the removal of cervical silva 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.430
 I can see that it can be 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.410
 seeing that more cervical portion 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
 with one of the ways in which 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.700
 fatally I came back impressions that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 copies throughout that cervical portion and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 in the cervical suit and that is our idea 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.360
 is that today we try to facilitate and optimize 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.600
 our results our desires of the day 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600
 on the day
