00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.480
 update video of the editorial holstein 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.910
 not a professor again I am the one 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.940
 religion has turned four friends 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are here in the burgfried 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.279
 this castle pebble I had yes 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
 asked what you build here so pure 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 could 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.449
 and many had said on 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 This tactic space would be quite cool've 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.689
 I decided to stop here 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.199
 really a kind of tactic space too 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.170
 do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 but yes it is a bit degenerate 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.750
 So I have in principle a map of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.629
 built throughout our kingdom 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 you can see here you can get closer 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 So that's the way down here is wild 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 area because it starts our sport here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 one and there goes a way along here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.440
 that's not here 11 cards so that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.690
 I believe one to two cards 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 so that's neat orderly far 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.590
 away and then we will eventually come to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.860
 black fortress left here up 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.610
 From there, the Königstraße goes on 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.549
 altdorf so to our village that have 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 but we called Holdorf 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.470
 why yes, yes, exactly I could always now 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.729
 to show more closely so holdorf there is ours 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 holdorf then we have the lock here 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.060
 or summer still pretty quickly presented 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.960
 This is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.360
 We continue to this pebble where we 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.820
 we are now and go from there 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.789
 then again away here 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:51.759
 get deeper and deeper into one 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.750
 outpost then there is again a way 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 yes , that's not finished yet 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.409
 marksburg but this only started 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.380
 which is not completed and a 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.950
 Off to the Guttenberg also only stimulates 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.920
 started and is under construction 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.989
 a huge area yes and as I do this 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.989
 So I thought so 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.980
 first I wanted map of yes 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.560
 the entire kingdom 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.959
 and since you still have tickets we are now in 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.459
 the 1.6 version since you have not yet 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.680
 I can turn them over on the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.560
 On Wall I placed thought of as 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.630
 clock placed on the wall so shit 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.450
 I have it somehow 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.910
 namely devised the yes in shape 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.940
 a map built out of wood edged 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.120
 and then I went and got 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.670
 even here these territories in 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.850
 colored in different colors so 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 gray neutral area of ​​the village thumb 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.350
 are still mines but not yet 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.709
 presented then we have red here 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.660
 area of ​​the burgwiese grinding stone with 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.630
 the castle that is in principle that will 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.040
 King's kingdom yes then we have 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.230
 the marksburg green and then blue yet 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 the bag fred black the black 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.569
 fortress and then here this wild one 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.830
 area south of the wall in our case 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.450
 here is noah 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.890
 is a reference to game of thrones 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.930
 but only a little 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.840
 the map he is so created in the course 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.970
 the time to get here now so one 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.330
 Everything can be good from below 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 recognizes what's down here but long ago 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.780
 not what's up there is all that looks 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.100
 One does not, that's why we have here 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.200
 built an elevator that is in 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.550
 principle as a pulley pulling a 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.450
 hero and there it goes down and me 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.280
 Show yourself now like the whole 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.280
 works then it turns on here 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.860
 and now you get up here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.860
 catapulted 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.060
 and now you can see the upper part of the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.080
 look at the map is not great 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.720
 juhu super roll and down there you have to 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.720
 Just jump here so the whole thing looks 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.650
 seen from when the button moment 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.650
 over the button presses 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:25.930
 is a small mechanic I was lucky 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.449
 that I had space here under it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.479
 is just the blanket of the king's room 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.389
 and he was exactly one row and yes 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.780
 the whole mechanic gets in there 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.780
 hidden 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.250
 it is a very complex thing in the world 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.229
 principle it was a bit of work here 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.840
 the whole card has to place but 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.310
 otherwise it's kind of cool that way 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.770
 especially if you come as a king high 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.830
 think so yes I have a huge card 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.880
 from my entire kingdom that it 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.680
 So that was my favorite room 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.220
 up here so for that not yet 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.360
 Know where that was here in this tower 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.229
 was there on the royal vegetables over 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.699
 the king made ok I would have 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.750
 Whats fallen please write something 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.750
 and we'll see you next time
