00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
bulk of the vinyl ramp now is done as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.060 
bulk of the vinyl ramp now is done as
you<00:00:10.179> can<00:00:10.210> see<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.780> pearlescent<00:00:11.139> matte<00:00:11.530> red<00:00:11.559> is

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
you can see the pearlescent matte red is

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.680 
you can see the pearlescent matte red is
really<00:00:12.280> reflecting<00:00:12.969> the<00:00:13.059> light<00:00:13.090> on<00:00:13.420> the<00:00:13.509> roof

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
really reflecting the light on the roof

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.640 
really reflecting the light on the roof
there<00:00:14.610> gives<00:00:15.610> it<00:00:15.730> a<00:00:15.820> very<00:00:15.849> dynamic<00:00:16.410> look<00:00:17.410> to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
there gives it a very dynamic look to

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.349 
there gives it a very dynamic look to
the<00:00:17.770> vinyl<00:00:18.039> if<00:00:18.400> you've<00:00:18.550> got<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.789> blue<00:00:19.060> light

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
the vinyl if you've got a blue light

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.060 
the vinyl if you've got a blue light
above<00:00:19.660> it<00:00:19.779> or<00:00:19.900> a<00:00:19.930> white<00:00:20.230> light<00:00:20.500> it's<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.830> very

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
above it or a white light it's a very

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.580 
above it or a white light it's a very
different<00:00:21.490> look<00:00:21.640> again<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.230> wheels<00:00:23.410> are

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
different look again so the wheels are

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.740 
different look again so the wheels are
on<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.850> look<00:00:25.000> great<00:00:25.500> filled<00:00:26.500> up<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.710> arch<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
on they look great filled up the arch I

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.130 
on they look great filled up the arch I
still<00:00:29.560> wish<00:00:29.769> I'd<00:00:29.920> gone<00:00:30.099> bigger<00:00:30.400> but<00:00:31.330> again

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
still wish I'd gone bigger but again

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.020 
still wish I'd gone bigger but again
living<00:00:32.559> around<00:00:32.649> here<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.190> road<00:00:33.370> conditions

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
living around here the road conditions

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.360 
living around here the road conditions
that's<00:00:34.420> probably<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.380> wise<00:00:35.559> decision<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:36.219> me

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
that's probably the wise decision to me

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.549 
that's probably the wise decision to me
and<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:37.030> can<00:00:37.180> see<00:00:37.210> I've<00:00:37.809> got<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.020> little<00:00:38.350> bit<00:00:38.440> of

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
and you can see I've got a little bit of

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.639 
and you can see I've got a little bit of
room<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.770> drop<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.309> car<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.520> bit<00:00:39.820> further

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
room to drop the car a bit further

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.930 
room to drop the car a bit further
probably<00:00:41.649> another<00:00:41.829> 1<00:00:42.160> inch<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.520> get<00:00:42.610> it<00:00:42.730> sat

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
probably another 1 inch to get it sat

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.160 
probably another 1 inch to get it sat
further<00:00:43.300> down<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:43.719> we've<00:00:43.840> still<00:00:43.930> got<00:00:44.110> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700 
see I was talking about that blending
that<00:01:48.850> line<00:01:49.119> in<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.600> still<00:01:50.140> wanted<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.470> slight

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
that line in I still wanted a slight

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.440 
that line in I still wanted a slight
definition<00:01:51.340> there<00:01:51.549> because<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:51.909> did<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.240> that

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
definition there because I did like that

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.380 
definition there because I did like that
angle<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.990> they've<00:01:53.140> got<00:01:53.350> already<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.240> was

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
angle that they've got already so I was

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.179 
angle that they've got already so I was
very<00:01:55.420> happy<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.710> next<00:01:56.920> stage

pointing upwards I'm going to two of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.280 
pointing upwards I'm going to two of
them<00:02:48.760> directly<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.450> center<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:49.989> burnt

them directly in the center with a burnt
tip<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.739> think<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.010> look<00:02:51.190> quite<00:02:51.280> good<00:02:51.640> at<00:02:51.760> your

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
tip I think I look quite good at your

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.840 
tip I think I look quite good at your
system<00:02:52.360> all<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> way<00:02:52.690> back<00:02:53.050> down<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.520> three

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
system all the way back down to a three

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.060 
system all the way back down to a three
inch<00:02:54.970> wide<00:02:55.060> piece<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.380> down

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
inch wide piece and then on to the down

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.340 
inch wide piece and then on to the down
pipe<00:02:57.400> at<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.640> front<00:02:57.940> there<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:59.200> definitely

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
pipe at the front there it's definitely

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.920 
pipe at the front there it's definitely
going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.739> make<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.070> loud<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:01.060> six<00:03:01.600> inch<00:03:01.810> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
going to make it loud it's six inch of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.610 
going to make it loud it's six inch of
tubing<00:03:02.410> coming<00:03:02.650> back<00:03:02.800> off<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> down<00:03:03.190> pipe

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
tubing coming back off the down pipe

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.750 
tubing coming back off the down pipe
hopefully<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:05.739> quite<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.950> deep<00:03:06.220> town<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.700> it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
hopefully it's quite a deep town and it

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.790 
hopefully it's quite a deep town and it
doesn't<00:03:07.060> sound<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:08.340> absolute<00:03:09.340> riser<00:03:10.800> if

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
doesn't sound like a absolute riser if

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.870 
doesn't sound like a absolute riser if
it<00:03:11.920> does<00:03:12.100> it'll<00:03:12.250> be<00:03:12.340> coming<00:03:12.610> straight<00:03:12.820> off

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
it does it'll be coming straight off

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.680 
it does it'll be coming straight off
less<00:03:13.180> but<00:03:13.420> ah<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:15.340> again<00:03:15.970> please<00:03:16.300> post
