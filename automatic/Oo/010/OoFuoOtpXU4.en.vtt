00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.940
 after recognizing the existence of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 extraterrestrial life at nasa solved 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.860
 to prepare astronauts to communicate 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.480
 with aliens the details with the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.480
 matching art 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 drawings mysterious images symbols 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.770
 signs that are still found today in 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 various corners of the world 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.590
 the most recent was discovered in the last 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.720
 sunday in ipuaÃ§Ãº west of santa 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.860
 catarina were made in a plantation 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.920
 wheat 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.729
 the oldest dating from the 17th century 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.110
 scientists argue that 80% of these 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.410
 agroglÃ­fos as they are called are 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.320
 mounts fraud but consider that 20% 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.050
 are messages from another way of life already 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.380
 that there are no marks of the hand of man 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.929
 to this day the significance of this phenomenon is 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.240
 a mystery to nasa believes that these 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.000
 drawings are made by aliens as 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.979
 preparation for the future contact 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 theory is in this book on 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.880
 agency extraterrestrial communication 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.610
 space station 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.640
 released four months ago the publication 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.830
 leaves astrophysics aside and explores 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.830
 way to understand a future outside 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:26.170
 of the Earth addresses various types of contact 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:29.060
 sound and visual magnetic waves 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.610
 symbols and mathematical elements and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.100
 teaching to astronaut would already be 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.530
 receiving training on these forms 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.720
 communication is the second time that 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.360
 the American space agency talks about 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.910
 intelligent life off the ground for 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.069
 this hypothesis must be confirmed and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.800
 no more than 20 years 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.690
 this meeting in massachusetts 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.490
 scientists recognized the existence of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.250
 100 million planets in the Milky Way 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.680
 with conditions to shelter life 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.600
 imagine the surprise when we 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.310
 the human race realizes that it is not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.950
 alone in the universe 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.079
 menongue long 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.360
 said mette monta director of instituto 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.159
 space science and die debate 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.549
 responsible for launching a 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.060
 satellite that will trace 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.060
 extraterrestrials 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.939
 the contact may be closer than 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.189
 imagines at three weeks the image of a 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.959
 unidentified object in the orbit of the 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.989
 earth has been registered by the camera 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.900
 coupled to iss the space station 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.819
 that transmits to the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.430
 I live on nasa's website 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.680
 the agency. 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.950
 turned off the camera for a few 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.629
 hours to the venue and to kevin liles 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.930
 curator of the washington space museum 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.870
 even a matter of time she tells 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.639
 space telescopes and satellites 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.909
 astrium which chemical combinations 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.439
 that allow the existence of life 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.769
 look for similar planets 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.790
 with our aunt feature I would like 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.790
 they found life 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 ah
