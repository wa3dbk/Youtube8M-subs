want them to but that way it was done

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.770 
want them to but that way it was done
quicker<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.450> back<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:56.690> it

quicker and that get it back and it
would<00:03:56.870> be<00:03:56.989> shrunk<00:03:57.260> there's<00:03:58.130> not<00:03:58.310> actually<00:03:58.459> a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
would be shrunk there's not actually a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.000 
would be shrunk there's not actually a
huge<00:03:58.970> amount<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.630> talk<00:03:59.780> about<00:03:59.900> with<00:04:00.590> packing

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
huge amount to talk about with packing
