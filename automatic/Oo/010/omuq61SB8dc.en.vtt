my second video on DNA technology from
unit<00:00:05.220> 5<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:06.690> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> look

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
unit 5 in this video we're going to look

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.410 
unit 5 in this video we're going to look
at<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.350> vivo<00:00:07.890> gene<00:00:07.919> cloning<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.150> use<00:00:09.240> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
at in vivo gene cloning on the use of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.100 
at in vivo gene cloning on the use of
plasmid<00:00:09.809> vectors<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:11.010> here's<00:00:11.219> our<00:00:11.340> objectives

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
plasmid vectors so here's our objectives

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.299 
plasmid vectors so here's our objectives
we're<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> describe<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.950> action<00:00:14.099> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
we're going to describe the action of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.580 
we're going to describe the action of
DNA<00:00:14.639> ligase<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.049> understand<00:00:16.500> how

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
DNA ligase we're going to understand how

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
DNA ligase we're going to understand how
genes<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.340> inserted<00:00:17.730> into<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> plasmid

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
genes can be inserted into a plasmid

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.480 
genes can be inserted into a plasmid
vector<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> explain<00:00:20.430> how

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
vector and we're going to explain how

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
vector and we're going to explain how
host<00:00:21.090> cells<00:00:21.449> containing<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> recombinant

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
host cells containing the recombinant

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.990 
host cells containing the recombinant
plasmid<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> identified<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> let's<00:00:26.820> get

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
plasmid can be identified so let's get

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.080 
plasmid can be identified so let's get
started<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.539> looking<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.900> DNA<00:00:28.019> ligase<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.789> DNA

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
started by looking at DNA ligase so DNA

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.350 
started by looking at DNA ligase so DNA
ligase<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:31.349> job<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.369> join<00:00:32.610> together<00:00:32.880> DNA

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
ligase it's job is to join together DNA

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330 
ligase it's job is to join together DNA
fragments<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.110> complementary<00:00:35.040> sticky

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
fragments that have complementary sticky

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.020 
fragments that have complementary sticky
ends<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.829> sticky<00:00:37.829> ended<00:00:38.219> fragments

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ends the thing is sticky ended fragments

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.020 
ends the thing is sticky ended fragments
will<00:00:39.649> automatically<00:00:40.649> anneal<00:00:41.460> together<00:00:41.850> they

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
will automatically anneal together they

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.200 
will automatically anneal together they
will<00:00:42.180> stick<00:00:42.480> back<00:00:42.719> together<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
will stick back together but the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
will stick back together but the
hydrogen<00:00:45.780> bonds<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.350> only<00:00:46.530> form<00:00:46.950> between

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
hydrogen bonds will only form between

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.690 
hydrogen bonds will only form between
the<00:00:48.420> complementary<00:00:49.079> base<00:00:49.110> pairs<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.489> means

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the complementary base pairs which means

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
the complementary base pairs which means
that<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.390> broken<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:52.260> easily<00:00:52.410> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that they can be broken pretty easily so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.729 
that they can be broken pretty easily so
DNA<00:00:53.520> ligase<00:00:54.059> its<00:00:54.480> job<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> complete<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
DNA ligase its job is to complete the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
DNA ligase its job is to complete the
sugar<00:00:56.039> phosphate<00:00:56.399> backbone<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.239> get

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
sugar phosphate backbone so we get

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.950 
sugar phosphate backbone so we get
stable<00:00:57.930> double<00:00:58.530> strand<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.190> DNA<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
stable double strand of DNA and this is

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
stable double strand of DNA and this is
really<00:01:01.199> useful<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> used<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
really useful because it can be used to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.130 
really useful because it can be used to
piece<00:01:02.760> together<00:01:02.940> many<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.570> DNA

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
piece together many different DNA

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
piece together many different DNA
fragments<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.030> pick<00:01:06.390> off<00:01:06.570> where<00:01:06.720> we

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
fragments so if we pick off where we

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
fragments so if we pick off where we
left<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> last<00:01:07.470> video<00:01:07.820> here's<00:01:08.820> two

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
left off in the last video here's two

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
left off in the last video here's two
sticky<00:01:09.840> ended<00:01:10.170> strands<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> DNA<00:01:11.430> some

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
sticky ended strands of DNA some

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
sticky ended strands of DNA some
fragments<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.170> been<00:01:13.200> produced

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
fragments and these have been produced

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
fragments and these have been produced
by<00:01:14.070> cutting<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:15.720> restriction

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
by cutting with the same restriction

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
by cutting with the same restriction
endonuclease<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> complementary<00:01:18.689> base

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
endonuclease so the complementary base

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.719 
endonuclease so the complementary base
pairs<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.070> means<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.549> can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pairs are there and that means we can

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.280 
pairs are there and that means we can
use<00:01:20.759> DNA<00:01:21.180> ligase<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.500> form<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.580> proper

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
use DNA ligase to form the proper

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.830 
use DNA ligase to form the proper
double-stranded<00:01:25.290> DNA<00:01:26.150> by<00:01:27.150> completing<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
double-stranded DNA by completing the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
double-stranded DNA by completing the
sugar<00:01:28.080> phosphate<00:01:28.259> backbone<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sugar phosphate backbone and this is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
sugar phosphate backbone and this is
recombinant<00:01:30.479> DNA<00:01:30.869> where<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.350> been<00:01:31.500> formed

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
recombinant DNA where it's been formed

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.760 
recombinant DNA where it's been formed
from<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.250> different<00:01:32.430> sources<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> how<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
from two different sources so how do we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.679 
from two different sources so how do we
get<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> host<00:01:35.820> cell<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> living

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
get this into a host cell or a living

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
get this into a host cell or a living
host<00:01:36.869> cell<00:01:37.220> because<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> end<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> day

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
host cell because at the end of the day

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.350 
host cell because at the end of the day
that's<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> vivo<00:01:39.869> means<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.770> living

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
that's what in vivo means in in living

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
that's what in vivo means in in living
so<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.020> into<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> living<00:01:43.500> cell<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.189> need<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so to get into a living cell we need to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.420 
so to get into a living cell we need to
use<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.759> vector<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.290> plasmids<00:01:47.310> as

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
use a vector and we use plasmids as

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.359 
use a vector and we use plasmids as
vectors<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.689> circular<00:01:49.290> rings<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.710> DNA

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
vectors which are circular rings of DNA

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
vectors which are circular rings of DNA
that<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:51.540> found<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.009> some<00:01:53.009> bacteria

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that are found in some bacteria

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
that are found in some bacteria
obviously<00:01:54.000> most<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.570> say<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.899> but

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
obviously most and I would say all but

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
obviously most and I would say all but
some<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:58.200> example<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
some and here we have an example of a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
some and here we have an example of a
plasma<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.110> plasmids<00:02:01.890> often<00:02:02.520> contain<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
plasma so plasmids often contain the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
plasma so plasmids often contain the
genes<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.479> antibiotic<00:02:04.079> resistance<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.920> I've

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
genes for antibiotic resistance so I've

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
genes for antibiotic resistance so I've
got<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.579> blue<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.360> gene<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.810> antibiotic

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
got in blue the gene for antibiotic

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.639 
got in blue the gene for antibiotic
resistant<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.310> tetracycline<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:10.289> dark

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
resistant to tetracycline and in dark

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
resistant to tetracycline and in dark
blue<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> gene<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.420> antibiotic

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
blue I have the gene for antibiotic

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
blue I have the gene for antibiotic
resistance<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
resistance to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.740 
resistance to
Basilian<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.490> bacterium<00:02:16.240> was<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
Basilian so if a bacterium was to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.260 
Basilian so if a bacterium was to
contain<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.380> vector<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.550> was<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:18.970> contain

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
contain this vector that was to contain

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.540 
contain this vector that was to contain
this<00:02:19.420> plasmid<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.620> wouldn't<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.130> able<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.460> be

this plasmid it wouldn't be able to be
killed<00:02:21.790> by<00:02:21.940> tetracycline<00:02:22.690> or<00:02:22.810> an<00:02:23.530> Basilian<00:02:24.180> so

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
killed by tetracycline or an Basilian so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
killed by tetracycline or an Basilian so
if<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.570> want<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> insert<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.560> fragment<00:02:27.160> into

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
if we want to insert a fragment into

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.970 
if we want to insert a fragment into
this<00:02:27.730> plasmid<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.750> insert<00:02:29.110> into<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> host<00:02:29.710> cell

this plasmid to insert into a host cell

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.870 
this plasmid to insert into a host cell
we<00:02:30.520> would<00:02:30.670> cut<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.380> plasmid<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.760> would

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
we would cut the plasmid and we would

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.730 
we would cut the plasmid and we would
cut<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.210> pretty<00:02:34.510> much<00:02:34.750> smack<00:02:35.110> bang<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.440> the

resistance<00:02:39.730> genes<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.110> would<00:02:41.230> cut<00:02:41.380> it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
resistance genes and we would cut it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.860 
resistance genes and we would cut it
with<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.830> same<00:02:42.100> endonuclease<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.660> use

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
with the same endonuclease that we use

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.960 
with the same endonuclease that we use
to<00:02:44.080> produce<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.710> DNA<00:02:44.980> fragment<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:45.820> wish

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
to produce the DNA fragment that we wish

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.820 
to produce the DNA fragment that we wish
to<00:02:46.000> insert<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:47.350> here<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:47.680> are

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
to insert so here we are

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.220 
to insert so here we are
there's<00:02:48.100> our<00:02:48.280> DNA<00:02:48.670> fragment<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.080> use

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
there's our DNA fragment and we can use

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.330 
there's our DNA fragment and we can use
DNA<00:02:50.530> ligase<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.310> form<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.820> recombinant<00:02:52.420> plasmid

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
DNA ligase to form a recombinant plasmid

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.110 
DNA ligase to form a recombinant plasmid
now<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.600> now<00:02:55.600> note<00:02:55.960> at<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.130> point<00:02:57.490> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
now we are now note at this point that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.810 
now we are now note at this point that
the<00:02:58.270> gene<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:58.810> antibiotic<00:02:59.440> resistance<00:02:59.980> test

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the gene for antibiotic resistance test

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.870 
the gene for antibiotic resistance test
het<00:03:00.910> recyclin<00:03:01.480> has<00:03:01.930> been<00:03:02.200> disrupted<00:03:02.880> whereas

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
het recyclin has been disrupted whereas

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.850 
het recyclin has been disrupted whereas
the<00:03:04.030> gene<00:03:04.300> for<00:03:04.660> unn<00:03:04.900> Basilian<00:03:05.410> resistance

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
the gene for unn Basilian resistance

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.780 
the gene for unn Basilian resistance
remains<00:03:06.040> intact

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
remains intact

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.450 
remains intact
so<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.660> means<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.960> this<00:03:08.290> bacterium<00:03:09.070> if<00:03:09.250> it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
so that means that this bacterium if it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.970 
so that means that this bacterium if it
contained<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:09.910> plasmid<00:03:10.330> sry<00:03:10.800> could<00:03:11.800> be

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
contained this plasmid sry could be

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.490 
contained this plasmid sry could be
killed<00:03:12.280> by<00:03:12.760> tetracycline<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:13.990> not<00:03:14.200> by

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
killed by tetracycline but not by

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.340 
killed by tetracycline but not by
ampicillin<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.390> we<00:03:16.510> need<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.750> get<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.110> vector

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
ampicillin so we need to get this vector

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.760 
ampicillin so we need to get this vector
this<00:03:17.680> plasmid<00:03:18.100> here<00:03:18.310> into<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> bacterium<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
this plasmid here into a bacterium and

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.620 
this plasmid here into a bacterium and
we<00:03:20.860> do<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.160> by<00:03:21.340> something<00:03:21.610> called<00:03:21.760> bacterial

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
we do this by something called bacterial

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.320 
we do this by something called bacterial
transformation<00:03:23.430> basically<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.940> case<00:03:25.120> of

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
transformation basically it's a case of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.270 
transformation basically it's a case of
taking<00:03:25.750> your<00:03:26.140> modified<00:03:26.560> plasmid<00:03:27.100> you're<00:03:27.250> a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
taking your modified plasmid you're a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.810 
taking your modified plasmid you're a
competent<00:03:27.820> plasmid<00:03:28.209> taking<00:03:28.990> your<00:03:29.110> bacterium

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
competent plasmid taking your bacterium

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.490 
competent plasmid taking your bacterium
adding<00:03:30.820> calcium<00:03:31.120> ions<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.870> heating<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
adding calcium ions and heating and that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.600 
adding calcium ions and heating and that
makes<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.580> bacteria<00:03:34.260> permeable<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
makes the bacteria permeable so the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.210 
makes the bacteria permeable so the
plasmid<00:03:37.360> will<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.600> taken<00:03:38.050> in<00:03:38.200> through<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
plasmid will be taken in through the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.880 
plasmid will be taken in through the
cell<00:03:39.400> wall<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.970> cell<00:03:40.060> membrane<00:03:40.890> there's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
cell wall and the cell membrane there's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
cell wall and the cell membrane there's
a<00:03:41.980> problem<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.459> though<00:03:42.670> because<00:03:42.790> it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
a problem with this though because it

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.820 
a problem with this though because it
doesn't<00:03:43.090> always<00:03:43.209> work<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.320> massively

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
doesn't always work it's not massively

take up the plasmid the other problem is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.000 
take up the plasmid the other problem is
that<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.840> recombinant<00:03:53.410> plasmid<00:03:53.770> doesn't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
that the recombinant plasmid doesn't

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.710 
that the recombinant plasmid doesn't

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.479 
together before the DNA fragment is
taken<00:04:04.330> in<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.650> we<00:04:05.860> need<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:06.130> be<00:04:06.220> able<00:04:06.310> to

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
taken in so we need to be able to

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.120 
taken in so we need to be able to
confidently<00:04:06.940> identify<00:04:07.660> which<00:04:08.290> bacteria<00:04:08.890> have

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
confidently identify which bacteria have

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.960 
confidently identify which bacteria have
taken<00:04:09.520> up<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.670> plasmid<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:10.209> which<00:04:10.750> haven't

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
taken up the plasmid and which haven't

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.340 
taken up the plasmid and which haven't
so<00:04:12.970> how<00:04:13.209> do<00:04:13.270> we<00:04:13.390> do<00:04:13.540> this<00:04:13.690> well<00:04:14.020> we<00:04:14.140> need<00:04:14.260> to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
so how do we do this well we need to

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.860 
so how do we do this well we need to
understand<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:15.160> couple<00:04:15.670> of<00:04:15.820> things<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.660> here's

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
understand a couple of things so here's

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.260 
understand a couple of things so here's
a<00:04:16.930> bacterium<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.830> has<00:04:18.040> no<00:04:18.340> plasmid<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.090> guy

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
a bacterium that has no plasmid this guy

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.700 
a bacterium that has no plasmid this guy
can<00:04:19.510> be<00:04:19.540> killed<00:04:19.840> by<00:04:20.049> antibiotics

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.120 

this<00:04:22.919> guy<00:04:23.130> here<00:04:23.520> has<00:04:23.759> taken<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:24.509> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
this guy here has taken up the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.620 
this guy here has taken up the
unsuccessful<00:04:26.130> plasmid<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> one<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.330> didn't

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
unsuccessful plasmid the one that didn't

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.469 
unsuccessful plasmid the one that didn't
take<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.139> fragment<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:29.490> can't<00:04:30.180> be

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
take in the fragment this can't be

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.150 
take in the fragment this can't be
killed<00:04:30.750> by<00:04:31.550> tetracycline<00:04:32.550> or<00:04:32.669> imbecilic

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
killed by tetracycline or imbecilic

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400 
killed by tetracycline or imbecilic
because<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.370> genes<00:04:35.580> are<00:04:35.729> still<00:04:35.880> intact<00:04:36.410> this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
because the genes are still intact this

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.219 
because the genes are still intact this
guy<00:04:37.759> took<00:04:38.759> up<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.060> plasmid<00:04:39.630> successfully

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
guy took up this plasmid successfully

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.230 
guy took up this plasmid successfully
and<00:04:40.440> it's<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> right<00:04:41.039> plasmid<00:04:41.520> as<00:04:41.639> well<00:04:41.789> this

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and it's the right plasmid as well this

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.570 
and it's the right plasmid as well this
guy<00:04:42.479> can<00:04:42.720> only<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:43.229> killed<00:04:43.440> by<00:04:43.740> tetracycline

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
guy can only be killed by tetracycline

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.580 
guy can only be killed by tetracycline
and<00:04:44.759> ampicillin<00:04:46.880> will<00:04:47.880> not<00:04:48.180> kill<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.110> because

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and ampicillin will not kill it because

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.290 
and ampicillin will not kill it because
the<00:04:49.770> gene<00:04:49.979> for<00:04:50.130> ampicillin<00:04:50.430> resistance<00:04:51.060> is

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the gene for ampicillin resistance is

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.749 
the gene for ampicillin resistance is
still<00:04:51.419> intact<00:04:51.949> and<00:04:52.949> we<00:04:53.099> can<00:04:53.220> use<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> couple<00:04:53.639> of

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
still intact and we can use a couple of

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.749 
still intact and we can use a couple of
different<00:04:54.120> ways<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:55.349> identify<00:04:55.949> successful

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
different ways to to identify successful

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.150 
different ways to to identify successful
hosts<00:04:57.270> first<00:04:57.840> which<00:04:58.169> there's<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.830> really<00:04:59.070> nice

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
hosts first which there's a really nice

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.740 
hosts first which there's a really nice
example<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.880> old<00:04:59.910> way<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.240> doing<00:05:00.539> things

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
example of the old way of doing things

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.409 
example of the old way of doing things
which<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:01.080> replica<00:05:01.530> plating<00:05:02.210> basically<00:05:03.210> you

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
which is replica plating basically you

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.320 
which is replica plating basically you
would<00:05:03.570> grow<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:04.110> bunch<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.650> bacteria<00:05:04.889> on<00:05:05.460> some

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
would grow a bunch of bacteria on some

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.159 
would grow a bunch of bacteria on some
agar<00:05:06.750> jelly<00:05:07.880> from<00:05:08.880> there<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.780> would<00:05:09.870> take<00:05:10.139> a

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
agar jelly from there you would take a

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.839 
agar jelly from there you would take a
copy<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.770> basically<00:05:11.009> just<00:05:11.340> press<00:05:11.639> on

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
copy so you basically just press on

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.600 
copy so you basically just press on
another<00:05:12.360> agar<00:05:12.780> plate<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.289> top<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:14.070> the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
another agar plate on top of the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.219 
another agar plate on top of the
original<00:05:14.759> plate<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.870> take<00:05:16.020> like<00:05:16.199> a

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
original plate and take like a

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.620 
original plate and take like a
fingerprint<00:05:16.800> of<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.180> would<00:05:18.300> grow<00:05:18.509> it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
fingerprint of it and you would grow it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.450 
fingerprint of it and you would grow it
again<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:19.169> time<00:05:19.470> though<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.860> will<00:05:20.009> be<00:05:20.070> on<00:05:20.220> a

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
again this time though it will be on a

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.120 
again this time though it will be on a
plate<00:05:20.940> with<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.389> piece<00:05:21.690> Ilyn<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.830> this<00:05:22.949> would

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
plate with a piece Ilyn so this would

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.490 
plate with a piece Ilyn so this would
kill<00:05:23.370> off<00:05:23.490> all<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.479> organisms<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:25.259> the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
kill off all of the organisms of the

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.070 
kill off all of the organisms of the
bacteria<00:05:26.009> that<00:05:26.190> were<00:05:26.849> not<00:05:27.090> resistant<00:05:27.840> to

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
bacteria that were not resistant to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.409 
bacteria that were not resistant to
ampicillin<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:29.639> would<00:05:29.759> then<00:05:29.970> do<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.240> same

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
ampicillin you would then do the same

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.960 
ampicillin you would then do the same
thing<00:05:30.479> again<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.979> with<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.159> tetracycline

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
thing again but with a tetracycline

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.790 
thing again but with a tetracycline
plate<00:05:33.590> okay<00:05:34.620> so<00:05:35.460> by<00:05:36.090> doing<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:37.380> can<00:05:37.409> see

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
plate okay so by doing this you can see

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.430 
plate okay so by doing this you can see
which<00:05:38.460> bacteria<00:05:38.969> have<00:05:39.449> taken<00:05:39.900> up<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.409> plasmid

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
which bacteria have taken up the plasmid

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.580 
which bacteria have taken up the plasmid
and<00:05:40.919> more<00:05:41.669> importantly<00:05:42.120> by<00:05:42.719> comparing<00:05:43.469> the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
and more importantly by comparing the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.529 
and more importantly by comparing the
tetracycline<00:05:44.370> plate<00:05:44.669> to<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.180> ampicillin

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
tetracycline plate to the ampicillin

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.550 
tetracycline plate to the ampicillin
plate<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.560> can<00:05:46.740> see<00:05:46.979> which<00:05:47.690> organism<00:05:48.690> have

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
plate you can see which organism have

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.219 
plate you can see which organism have
taken<00:05:49.919> up<00:05:50.039> the<00:05:50.310> correct<00:05:50.639> plasmid<00:05:51.300> or<00:05:51.449> the<00:05:52.050> one

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
taken up the correct plasmid or the one

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.020 
taken up the correct plasmid or the one
that's<00:05:52.469> been<00:05:52.650> made<00:05:52.889> recombinant<00:05:53.520> because<00:05:53.909> at

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
that's been made recombinant because at

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.200 
that's been made recombinant because at
the<00:05:54.090> end<00:05:54.210> of<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.360> day<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:56.039> recombinant<00:05:57.000> one

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
the end of the day the recombinant one

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.480 
the end of the day the recombinant one
will<00:05:58.050> be<00:05:58.199> able<00:05:58.349> to<00:05:58.560> be<00:05:58.680> killed<00:05:58.949> by<00:05:59.130> ampicillin

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
will be able to be killed by ampicillin

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.149 
will be able to be killed by ampicillin
but<00:06:00.419> not<00:06:00.599> by<00:06:00.780> tetracycline<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.770> it'll<00:06:01.919> be<00:06:02.039> the

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
but not by tetracycline so it'll be the

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:03.709 
but not by tetracycline so it'll be the
colony<00:06:02.580> that's<00:06:02.759> present<00:06:03.150> on<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.419> ampicillin

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
colony that's present on the ampicillin

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.760 
colony that's present on the ampicillin
plate<00:06:04.169> but<00:06:04.949> not<00:06:05.190> on<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.820> tetracycline<00:06:06.479> plate

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
plate but not on the tetracycline plate

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.839 
plate but not on the tetracycline plate
there<00:06:07.770> are<00:06:07.889> other<00:06:08.070> ways<00:06:08.159> of<00:06:08.310> doing<00:06:08.460> this<00:06:08.639> more

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
there are other ways of doing this more

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.670 
there are other ways of doing this more
modern<00:06:09.120> techniques<00:06:09.509> for<00:06:09.960> example<00:06:10.050> we<00:06:10.500> can<00:06:10.650> use

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
modern techniques for example we can use

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.409 
modern techniques for example we can use
fluorescent<00:06:11.070> gene<00:06:11.490> markers<00:06:12.000> which<00:06:12.270> is

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
fluorescent gene markers which is

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.930 
fluorescent gene markers which is
basically<00:06:12.780> where<00:06:12.990> we<00:06:13.110> insert<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:14.370> gene<00:06:14.610> for<00:06:14.880> a

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
basically where we insert the gene for a

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.760 
basically where we insert the gene for a
fluorescent<00:06:15.750> protein<00:06:16.139> which<00:06:16.289> is<00:06:16.440> found<00:06:16.650> in

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
fluorescent protein which is found in

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.390 
fluorescent protein which is found in
jellyfish<00:06:17.219> called<00:06:17.460> GFP<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.960> then<00:06:19.469> we<00:06:19.710> insert

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
jellyfish called GFP and then we insert

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.790 
jellyfish called GFP and then we insert
the<00:06:20.880> desired<00:06:21.300> gene<00:06:21.479> that<00:06:21.570> we<00:06:21.659> want<00:06:21.930> in<00:06:22.139> the

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
the desired gene that we want in the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.209 
the desired gene that we want in the
middle<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.280> that<00:06:23.909> GFP<00:06:24.479> gene<00:06:24.509> and<00:06:25.219> bacteria

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
middle of that GFP gene and bacteria

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.740 
middle of that GFP gene and bacteria
which<00:06:26.370> do<00:06:26.550> not<00:06:26.580> show<00:06:26.849> the<00:06:27.000> green<00:06:27.210> fluorescence

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
which do not show the green fluorescence

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.600 
which do not show the green fluorescence
have<00:06:28.020> therefore<00:06:28.500> taken<00:06:29.250> up<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:29.580> plasmid

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
have therefore taken up the plasmid

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.230 
have therefore taken up the plasmid
successfully<00:06:30.979> now<00:06:31.979> we<00:06:32.159> can<00:06:32.310> also<00:06:32.460> use<00:06:32.760> enzyme

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
successfully now we can also use enzyme

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.050 
successfully now we can also use enzyme
markers<00:06:33.839> to<00:06:34.620> do<00:06:34.740> this<00:06:34.889> so

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
markers to do this so

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.550 
markers to do this so
you<00:06:36.240> could<00:06:36.389> insert<00:06:36.690> the<00:06:36.840> gene<00:06:37.020> for<00:06:37.169> lack<00:06:37.320> days

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
you could insert the gene for lack days

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.430 
you could insert the gene for lack days
and<00:06:38.520> basically<00:06:38.910> lack<00:06:39.389> days<00:06:39.630> will<00:06:39.870> turn<00:06:40.139> a

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
and basically lack days will turn a

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.610 
and basically lack days will turn a
specific<00:06:41.040> color<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.430> substrate<00:06:41.910> blue<00:06:42.620> the

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
specific color of substrate blue the

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.530 
specific color of substrate blue the
desired<00:06:44.280> gene<00:06:44.580> you're<00:06:44.790> then<00:06:44.910> gonna<00:06:45.120> insert

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
desired gene you're then gonna insert

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.260 
desired gene you're then gonna insert
right<00:06:45.870> in<00:06:46.020> the<00:06:46.110> middle<00:06:46.320> of<00:06:46.500> that<00:06:46.650> lactase<00:06:47.130> gene

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
right in the middle of that lactase gene

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.350 
right in the middle of that lactase gene
so<00:06:48.270> bacteria<00:06:48.930> which<00:06:49.080> do<00:06:49.440> not<00:06:49.470> produce<00:06:50.460> the

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
so bacteria which do not produce the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.480 
so bacteria which do not produce the
lactase<00:06:51.780> will<00:06:52.590> not<00:06:52.800> be<00:06:52.950> able<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.190> turn<00:06:53.340> the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
lactase will not be able to turn the

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.420 
lactase will not be able to turn the
substrate<00:06:53.880> blue<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.270> can<00:06:55.139> therefore<00:06:55.380> be<00:06:55.680> said

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
substrate blue and can therefore be said

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.510 
substrate blue and can therefore be said
to<00:06:56.880> have<00:06:56.970> taken<00:06:57.180> up<00:06:57.480> the<00:06:57.750> plasmid<00:06:58.340> this<00:06:59.340> is

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
to have taken up the plasmid this is

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.800 
to have taken up the plasmid this is
quite<00:06:59.700> complicated<00:07:00.060> it<00:07:00.389> might<00:07:00.510> take<00:07:00.690> a<00:07:00.720> couple

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
quite complicated it might take a couple

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.780 
quite complicated it might take a couple
of<00:07:01.080> watches<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.770> get<00:07:01.919> to<00:07:02.370> get<00:07:02.520> your<00:07:02.639> head

around this but do take your time with
it<00:07:04.680> it<00:07:04.830> can<00:07:05.160> be<00:07:05.310> tricky<00:07:05.690> so<00:07:06.690> to<00:07:06.750> summarize<00:07:07.230> a
