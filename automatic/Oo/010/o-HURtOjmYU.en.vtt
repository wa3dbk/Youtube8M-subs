her<00:05:41.380> like<00:05:41.620> this<00:05:41.800> one's<00:05:42.130> so<00:05:42.460> pretty<00:05:42.600> seating<00:05:43.600> is

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.850 

actually<00:05:48.850> very<00:05:49.030> important<00:05:49.660> that<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.290> have<00:05:50.620> to

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860
