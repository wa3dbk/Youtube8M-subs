00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello everyone today i'm shooting a video already 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.780
 sensational to this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.389
 hair oil which hair care 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 called 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:20.400
 I think my husband and you all know the oil 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.990
 minor anti fallout and strengthen 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.240
 Here I’m not a little hair 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390
 used 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 not very much because I will say right away 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 smell of course I don't know when smell 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.000
 of course a very strong smell 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 popolzuyutsya straight if I get 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 so I hear him later 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.820
 and after like washing off i have it then 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.030
 I constantly hear my feedback about him 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 I didn’t like her 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 let's not pay attention to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.370
 the smell this is for me not a little important well 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.260
 let's say about the effect and in general what is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:12.060
 amla i think you already know everything amla this 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.970
 It means the Indian gooseberry which 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.259
 occurs at a height of one and a half thousand 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 meters in the Himalayas that's made of it 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:29.340
 is butter well as far as I know here 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.640
 although they don't reveal what's here though 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.630
 here is written amla oil and oil 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.450
 almond here specifically here in this but i 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.420
 I read a lot and in some maslov then 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 there is such here it is oil 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.079
 that do not reveal the secret but add 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.040
 there are all sorts of coconut oil and all sorts 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.740
 base oils 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.970
 that is, and then they add 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.690
 butter 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 Well, there is 6 oil itself amly it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.390
 very, very fruit is necessary to make 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.729
 this butter there she probably cost a lot 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.619
 very expensive, that 's what I wanted to say 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.340
 very famous butter was known 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.970
 Wendy and due to its healing properties 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.450
 i.e. improves hair growth 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.490
 strengthens and melts gives shine 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 normalizes sebum secretion 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.070
 relieves inflammation of the scalp 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.320
 warns 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.780
 premature graying on the hair then 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.459
 there is and of course improves hair growth 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.160
 gives shine and so on means that i 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.610
 I can tell from myself I think you already 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.130
 many used many already read you 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.780
 know about this butter but my impression 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 From and Kohl means from pluses yes 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.350
 really more silky hair 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.420
 become so elastic principle not 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.330
 bad combing shiny no 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 discomfort on the head that is to say on the skin 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:20.670
 there is no head 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.890
 If I have a couple of minuses, let's say 1 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.890
 minus is the smell 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.370
 Smell of course I like honestly 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.840
 saying can't even say what he's not 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.770
 it looks like a very strong smell 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.690
 saturated and if its as written 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.190
 how you need it that is you can head up 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.180
 more so rub and pineapple put on 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:58.160
 the entire length of the hair can be applied on 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.459
 half an hour can be applied overnight at night 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.640
 this is not my option because the smell 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:09.440
 very saturated and 30 minutes is not 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.860
 maximum and then still go and hair 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.780
 will smell like you're 10 again with this my 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.920
 all shampoo and so on anyway this 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.019
 smell remain 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.810
 and the second minus can of course me 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.870
 it seemed maybe you used who 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.900
 write to me blond hair 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.010
 or maybe it is not specifically this oil 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.590
 gives such effect or can this oil 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.820
 almond this effect gives well shorter y 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.430
 me hair with this oil is a miracle for me so 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.680
 it seemed they were becoming a little 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.590
 so far but so greenish 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.919
 here is such a shade to me so 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.120
 it seemed a shade is obtained 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:59.390
 peduncles but it is literally a droplet here 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.520
 but there is a little bit of such an effect 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.780
 minus such a marriage did not seem 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.880
 write in the comments who are the girls 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:14.500
 used this oil in general 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.080
 you effect and if you are his blond hair 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.200
 what is your effect on hair is it 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.130
 really I am given a body or there 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.960
 It may not seem like it is green or 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:35.450
 Immediately affect the wanted one like this 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.990
 good oil can be used by anyone 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.760
 not very picky smell principle to whom 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.960
 there effects are important so on you will be 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.660
 put away left on 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:50.890
 I have already decided for myself that I have to smell and 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.830
 so very serious 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.820
 especially well somehow cosmetic 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.260
 makeup who so 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.440
 more or less but if there is a smell of creams or 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.349
 shampoos 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.460
 or here 's something for hair care there 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:11.270
 some kind of stalinka if there is such a smell 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.099
 too 0 7 saturated then i have it 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.810
 I constantly hear that I feel 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:23.120
 he interrupts the smell and toilet water then 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.220
 there is a well shorter and too much for me 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.849
 who used such oil please 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.620
 tell me 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:35.000
 I bought it at the pharmacy network 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:38.479
 general store pharmacy chamomile 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.900
 that's where I bought it in my cost 100 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.710
 milliliters here 40 hryvnia cake gives 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:49.070
 good 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:51.890
 You can use and do not smell but 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:58.220
 I still probably use water only 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:07:02.650
 when I don’t know my little one 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.789
