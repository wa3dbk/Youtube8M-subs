00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
not professionally done and my computer

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
not professionally done and my computer
just<00:00:33.809> doesn't<00:00:34.200> handle<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.190> that

slender the eight pages and with
improved<00:01:03.780> visuals<00:01:04.760> several<00:01:05.760> levels<00:01:05.970> I'm

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
improved visuals several levels I'm

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.910 
improved visuals several levels I'm
assuming<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.260> mean<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.710> say

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
assuming is what they mean when they say

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
assuming is what they mean when they say
more<00:01:08.400> levels<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> supposedly<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.080> sort<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
more levels and supposedly some sort of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
more levels and supposedly some sort of
engaging<00:01:10.939> storyline<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> pretty

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
engaging storyline so this is pretty

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.149 
engaging storyline so this is pretty
interesting<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.920> taking

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
interesting this is really taking

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
interesting this is really taking
Slenderman<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> whole<00:01:15.030> new<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> whole

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
has never really had a strong media
resource<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.840> base<00:01:25.259> itself<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
resource to base itself off of and this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
resource to base itself off of and this
is<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.820> gonna<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.500> Slenderman

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is really gonna make Slenderman

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.580 
is really gonna make Slenderman
something<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.460> stick<00:01:29.820> around<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.329> mean

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
something to really stick around I mean

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.929 
something to really stick around I mean
you<00:01:31.590> look<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.220> Frankenstein<00:01:32.909> or

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you look at things like Frankenstein or

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
you look at things like Frankenstein or
like<00:01:33.270> vampires<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.200> exactly<00:01:34.680> how

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like vampires and this is exactly how

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.580 
like vampires and this is exactly how
they<00:01:35.490> start<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> little<00:01:36.659> meth<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
they start you know a little meth and it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
they start you know a little meth and it
just<00:01:37.829> blows<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:38.909> blow

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
just blows up and this really gonna blow

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.499 
just blows up and this really gonna blow
it<00:01:39.240> up

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it up

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
it up
so<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.829> games<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.250> really

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so I think this games will be really

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
so I think this games will be really
