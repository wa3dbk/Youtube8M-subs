lip<00:00:58.299> balm<00:00:58.479> works<00:00:58.960> just<00:00:59.350> as<00:00:59.470> well<00:00:59.500> it's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
lip balm works just as well it's

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.619 
lip balm works just as well it's
basically<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.580> same<00:01:00.790> exact<00:01:01.449> ingredients

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
basically the same exact ingredients

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.229 
basically the same exact ingredients
anyway<00:01:02.500> but<00:01:02.979> it's<00:01:03.250> just<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.580> little<00:01:03.699> softer<00:01:04.210> so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
anyway but it's just a little softer so

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.880 
anyway but it's just a little softer so
that's<00:01:04.570> why<00:01:04.689> they<00:01:04.839> come<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.170> these<00:01:05.320> tubes<00:01:05.650> so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
that's why they come in these tubes so

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's why they come in these tubes so
that<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.220> holds<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.610> stick<00:01:07.030> alright<00:01:07.510> as

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
that it holds the stick alright as

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.210 
that it holds the stick alright as
opposed<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.110> lipstick<00:01:08.590> it's<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.830> little<00:01:09.100> bit

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
opposed to lipstick it's a little bit

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.890 
opposed to lipstick it's a little bit
more<00:01:09.400> firm<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.790> little<00:01:10.060> bit<00:01:10.150> more<00:01:10.270> solid<00:01:10.750> so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
more firm a little bit more solid so

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.620 
more firm a little bit more solid so
therefore<00:01:11.799> you<00:01:12.280> can<00:01:12.490> twist<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.000> in<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.360> you

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
therefore you can twist it in and you

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.120 
therefore you can twist it in and you
know<00:01:13.780> it's<00:01:14.140> not<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.590> break<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.890> stick

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
know it's not going to break the stick

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.310 
know it's not going to break the stick
because<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.909> little<00:01:16.180> harder<00:01:16.509> now<00:01:17.020> lip

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
because it's a little harder now lip

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.749 
because it's a little harder now lip
balm<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.650> just<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:18.159> softer<00:01:18.549> but<00:01:18.580> still

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
balm is just a little softer but still

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.690 
balm is just a little softer but still
works<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.659> same<00:01:19.689> exact<00:01:20.409> way<00:01:20.770> another<00:01:21.460> thing

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
works the same exact way another thing

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
works the same exact way another thing
that's<00:01:21.820> different<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.600> we're<00:01:23.020> using

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that's different is that we're using

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.730 
that's different is that we're using
teaspoons<00:01:24.250> okay<00:01:24.909> so<00:01:24.970> I<00:01:25.270> actually<00:01:25.810> took<00:01:26.289> the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
teaspoons okay so I actually took the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.539 
teaspoons okay so I actually took the
time<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:27.399> measure<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:29.200> weight<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.520> I

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
time to measure the weight that I

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.779 
time to measure the weight that I
previously<00:01:31.649> told<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.770> guys<00:01:32.890> about<00:01:33.159> in<00:01:33.429> two

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
previously told you guys about in two

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.940 
previously told you guys about in two
teaspoons<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.869> that's<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.649> first<00:01:35.829> thing

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
teaspoons so that's the first thing

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.099 
teaspoons so that's the first thing
we're<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.249> to<00:01:36.369> do<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:36.850> here<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.119> go<00:01:37.240> okay<00:01:37.450> so

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
we're going to do so here we go okay so

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.630 
we're going to do so here we go okay so
first<00:01:38.380> off<00:01:38.619> I<00:01:38.770> wanted<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.069> answer<00:01:39.280> this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
first off I wanted to answer this

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.859 
first off I wanted to answer this
question<00:01:39.850> for<00:01:40.240> those<00:01:40.329> of<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.539> guys<00:01:40.659> it

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
question for those of you guys it

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.620 
question for those of you guys it
doesn't<00:01:41.170> have<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.289> scale<00:01:41.740> alright<00:01:42.189> so<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
doesn't have a scale alright so it's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.779 
doesn't have a scale alright so it's
probably<00:01:43.960> better<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.499> you<00:01:44.710> do<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.159> by

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
probably better if you do this by

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.880 
probably better if you do this by
teaspoons<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.140> my<00:01:47.229> tea<00:01:47.380> spoon<00:01:47.679> in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
teaspoons and I have my tea spoon in

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.739 
teaspoons and I have my tea spoon in
here<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.369> my<00:01:48.520> scale<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:48.909> already<00:01:49.119> teared<00:01:49.539> at

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
here and my scale is already teared at

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.379 
here and my scale is already teared at
zero<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.799> it's<00:01:50.950> easier<00:01:51.249> to<00:01:51.310> also<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.329> with

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
zero so it's easier to also do this with

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.080 
zero so it's easier to also do this with
a<00:01:52.749> melted<00:01:53.350> base<00:01:54.009> already<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.789> we're<00:01:54.969> just

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
a melted base already and we're just

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.870 
a melted base already and we're just
going<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.389> see<00:01:55.659> how<00:01:56.020> much<00:01:56.200> three<00:01:57.159> grams<00:01:57.460> would

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
going to see how much three grams would

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.139 
going to see how much three grams would

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
go alright so 3 grams is about 3/4 of a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.070 
go alright so 3 grams is about 3/4 of a
teaspoon<00:02:25.870> guys<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.300> totally<00:02:28.569> full

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
teaspoon guys so it's not totally full

teaspoon guys so it's not totally full
it's<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.680> than<00:02:29.830> half<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.519> about<00:02:30.760> 3/4<00:02:31.599> of

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
it's more than half so it's about 3/4 of

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.429 
it's more than half so it's about 3/4 of
a<00:02:31.870> teaspoon

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
a teaspoon

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.140 
a teaspoon
of<00:02:33.650> your<00:02:33.950> melted<00:02:34.609> lipstick<00:02:35.450> base<00:02:36.819> okay<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:37.879> now

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
of your melted lipstick base okay so now

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
of your melted lipstick base okay so now
let's<00:02:38.450> measure<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:39.310> lip<00:02:40.310> tar<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.629> grams

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
let's measure the lip tar and to grams

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.319 
let's measure the lip tar and to grams
I'm<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.700> feeling<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.120> going

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
I'm going to have the feeling was going

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.990 
I'm going to have the feeling was going
to<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.569> half<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.980> then<00:02:46.129> again<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.700> know<00:02:46.730> we're

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
to be half but then again you know we're

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.129 
to be half but then again you know we're
doing<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.390> by<00:02:47.719> weight<00:02:48.109> and<00:02:49.750> usually<00:02:50.750> most<00:02:50.930> of

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
doing this by weight and usually most of

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.319 
doing this by weight and usually most of
the<00:02:51.200> time<00:02:51.290> different<00:02:52.129> kind<00:02:52.549> of<00:02:52.609> liquids<00:02:53.090> have

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
the time different kind of liquids have

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.390 
the time different kind of liquids have
different<00:02:53.719> weight<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.920> I'm<00:02:55.579> seeing<00:02:56.180> here<00:02:57.400> it's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
different weight so I'm seeing here it's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.280 
different weight so I'm seeing here it's
going<00:02:58.730> point<00:02:59.000> four<00:03:03.879> all<00:03:04.879> right<00:03:05.269> almost<00:03:05.930> we're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
going point four all right almost we're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.960 
going point four all right almost we're
at<00:03:06.379> one<00:03:06.560> point<00:03:06.799> eight<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.129> couple<00:03:07.549> more<00:03:07.669> drops

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
at one point eight a couple more drops

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.050 
at one point eight a couple more drops
probably<00:03:09.639> there<00:03:10.639> we<00:03:10.760> go

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
probably there we go
