00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
review of the VTX 1300 I think it's a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.400 
review of the VTX 1300 I think it's a
really<00:02:51.770> great<00:02:51.920> bike<00:02:52.280> has<00:02:52.880> enough<00:02:53.210> power<00:02:53.450> does

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
really great bike has enough power does

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.920 
really great bike has enough power does
everything<00:02:54.770> I<00:02:54.860> needed<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.660> really

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
everything I needed to do it's a really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.450 
everything I needed to do it's a really
good<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.410> up<00:02:57.620> bike<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.100> can<00:02:58.250> throw<00:02:58.430> a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
good to up bike you can throw a

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.100 
good to up bike you can throw a
passenger<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.090> here<00:02:59.330> never<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.840> have<00:02:59.990> to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
passenger on here never really have to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.890 
passenger on here never really have to
worry<00:03:00.260> about<00:03:00.380> having<00:03:00.620> enough<00:03:00.860> gusto<00:03:01.780> would<00:03:02.780> it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
worry about having enough gusto would it

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
worry about having enough gusto would it
be<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> good<00:03:03.500> bike<00:03:03.740> for<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> first<00:03:04.340> bike

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
be a good bike for a first bike

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.240 
be a good bike for a first bike
absolutely<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:06.080> has<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.230> very<00:03:06.500> low<00:03:06.710> seat<00:03:07.010> height

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
absolutely it has a very low seat height

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.940 
absolutely it has a very low seat height
so<00:03:08.120> even<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.540> short<00:03:08.810> person<00:03:09.170> can<00:03:09.290> ride<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.710> but

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
so even a short person can ride this but

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.590 
so even a short person can ride this but
it's<00:03:10.100> also<00:03:10.250> big<00:03:10.580> enough<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:11.030> tall<00:03:11.270> long

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
it's also big enough for a tall long

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.470 
it's also big enough for a tall long
person<00:03:12.020> like<00:03:12.140> myself<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.000> very<00:03:14.210> good

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
person like myself so it's a very good

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480 
person like myself so it's a very good
balance<00:03:14.750> buy<00:03:15.110> good<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> beginner<00:03:15.980> but

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
balance buy good for a beginner but

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.620 
balance buy good for a beginner but
excellent<00:03:16.970> for<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.540> seasoned<00:03:18.110> rider<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.630> you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
excellent for a seasoned rider that you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.090 
excellent for a seasoned rider that you
know<00:03:20.750> probably<00:03:21.050> won't<00:03:21.350> ever<00:03:21.470> outgrow<00:03:21.680> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
know probably won't ever outgrow this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.699 
know probably won't ever outgrow this
bike<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:23.120> it's<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.510> very<00:03:23.870> nice<00:03:24.110> balanced

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
bike so it's a very nice balanced

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.760 
bike so it's a very nice balanced
handling<00:03:25.520> it's<00:03:26.270> not<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> sport<00:03:26.810> bike<00:03:27.020> but<00:03:27.680> it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
handling it's not a sport bike but it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.190 
handling it's not a sport bike but it
handles<00:03:28.070> well<00:03:28.130> for<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.550> cruiser<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.780> not<00:03:29.959> as

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
handles well for a cruiser it's not as

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.080 
handles well for a cruiser it's not as
fast<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.740> a<00:03:30.770> sport<00:03:31.130> bike<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.640> mean<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.910> got<00:03:32.000> to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
fast as a sport bike I mean you got to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.790 
fast as a sport bike I mean you got to
remember<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.510> cruiser<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.500> don't<00:03:33.680> buy

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
remember it's a cruiser you don't buy

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.680 
remember it's a cruiser you don't buy
these<00:03:33.860> things<00:03:34.310> for<00:03:34.520> speed<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.209> buy<00:03:35.360> them<00:03:35.570> for

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
these things for speed you buy them for

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.440 
these things for speed you buy them for
comfort<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.500> cruising<00:03:36.980> for<00:03:37.160> fun<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:38.270> this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
comfort for cruising for fun but this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.970 
comfort for cruising for fun but this
thing<00:03:38.630> does<00:03:38.810> have<00:03:39.020> enough<00:03:39.260> power<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.800> can

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
thing does have enough power I can

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.400 
thing does have enough power I can
probably<00:03:40.340> get<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.850> 0<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.300> 60<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:41.720> about<00:03:41.990> five<00:03:42.260> and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
probably get a 0 to 60 in about five and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.680 
probably get a 0 to 60 in about five and
a<00:03:42.470> half<00:03:42.500> seconds<00:03:43.070> I'm<00:03:43.760> as<00:03:43.910> pretty<00:03:44.150> respectable

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
a half seconds I'm as pretty respectable

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.050 
a half seconds I'm as pretty respectable
I<00:03:45.020> can<00:03:45.590> beat<00:03:45.740> most<00:03:45.890> any<00:03:46.160> car<00:03:46.459> off<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.700> launch

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
I can beat most any car off the launch

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.510 
I can beat most any car off the launch
unless<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.660> some<00:03:47.840> high-performance<00:03:48.530> car<00:03:49.280> or

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
unless it's some high-performance car or

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.630 
unless it's some high-performance car or
something<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.030> know<00:03:50.180> really<00:03:50.450> fast<00:03:51.640> other

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
something you know really fast other

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.180 
something you know really fast other
than<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.420> know<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.570> think<00:03:53.720> top<00:03:54.709> speed<00:03:55.040> is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
than that you know I think top speed is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.060 
than that you know I think top speed is
about<00:03:55.340> 120<00:03:56.000> miles<00:03:56.150> an<00:03:56.390> hour<00:03:56.680> that's<00:03:57.680> more<00:03:57.920> than

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
about 120 miles an hour that's more than

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.430 
about 120 miles an hour that's more than
plenty<00:03:58.250> on<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.490> bike<00:03:58.700> like<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.140> no<00:04:00.140> need<00:04:00.320> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
plenty on a bike like this no need to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.410 
plenty on a bike like this no need to
ride<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.250> recommend<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.760> keep<00:04:01.970> to

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
ride like that I recommend you keep to

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.850 
ride like that I recommend you keep to
the<00:04:02.570> speed<00:04:02.810> limit<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.410> way<00:04:03.500> no<00:04:03.680> one<00:04:03.709> gets

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
the speed limit so that way no one gets

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.060 
the speed limit so that way no one gets
