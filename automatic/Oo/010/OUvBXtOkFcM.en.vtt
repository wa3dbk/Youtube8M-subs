00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.919
 in this lesson we are going to work on a 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.559
 simple example that will illustrate how 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.270
 insert images and other figures 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:14.340
 gradients of colorful animations and 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:18.750
 user input we will work on a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.750
 example similar to this one 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.849
 The first thing we have to see is how 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.720
 works the coordinate system of 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.310
 the miles 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.220
 you surely in the classes of 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.829
 mathematics told them that the 0 0 was 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.739
 down and to the left good when 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.739
 we work in line james and on the canvas 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.840
 of html5 as well as other frameworks 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.140
 games also not necessarily html5 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.790
 the initial coordinate the origin tends 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.170
 be located in the upper corner 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.510
 left then 0 0 is here to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.050
 there the x-axis advances and forwards it advances 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.150
 the y axis 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.670
 another concept that will be the angels 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.260
 is that the figures that we insert 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.370
 the polygons whether they are circles or also 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.770
 images any element that 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.540
 let's insert it has its own coordinates 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.080
 also starting in the upper corner 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.360
 left of the element this if I can not 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.250
 have a scene scene has its 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.050
 coordinate system and he exposes the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.440
 polygon also has its system of 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.680
 coordinates and that origin of the polygon is 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.570
 what is called the anchor point 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.220
 then we can define the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.280
 point that the anchor point is this 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 elsewhere for example us 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.820
 we can decide to define that point 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.850
 before being in the center and we 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.460
 we passed that point to the scene and the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.540
 polygon will go where the center of the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.580
 polygon will go at the point that 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.880
 we tell you then that point 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.899
 of anchoring we will see it also 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.100
 let's start let's develop let's go 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.100
 create a new project 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.740
 it's going to be called takeoff 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.820
 failed to write create create spain 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.100
 we go to the archives just like 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.620
 before we have the html and javascript 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.160
 here we are going to eliminate some things not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.530
 everyone 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.570
 because we are already familiar with what 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.960
 which is the director and the scenes so 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.860
 so much we are going to leave that 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.860
 we will leave 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.439
 the definition of the director and the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.439
 definition of the scene 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.130
 then I'm going to leave 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.460
 creating a gradient for the sky 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.240
 you saw that this is an image 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.650
 It has a gradient of color grade 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.980
 so that's what I'm going to call 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.720
 put comments here 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.210
 sky the comments here are going to be 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 completely in spanglish 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.200
 gradients 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.250
 then we will use a filling of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.480
 gradient and that we have to include it 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.090
 here 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.099
 this is called line dot field which is 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.970
 filling and it's going to be a linear gradient 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.980
 line of believers 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.160
 let's create a new line field 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.060
 line 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 bryant 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.189
 we will give a direction 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.189
 gradient 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.350
 in the address the origin 0,0 is entered 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.570
 and we're going to make the gradient go 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.080
 from there downwards therefore it goes to 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.570
 advance in the brand 1 1 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.600
 so you enter the vector that goes in that 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.600
 address 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.129
 let's add a color adcolor stop 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.620
 and that will be at the beginning 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.500
 and we enter the value ex aces and wrong 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.190
 hexadecimal color 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.300
 we repeat the same for the second color 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.300
 they are going to be two colors only 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.540
 sorry here is there we put one in 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.960
 this case 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.440
 and the color is going to be this one that I'm going to 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.009
 enter next 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.490
 this here 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.189
 perfect with that we have the gradient 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.110
 of the sky now is the gradient we 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.300
 we're going to apply it to a sprite to a 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.669
 rectangle as we saw before then 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.750
 I believe now the sky itself and 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:51.590
 this is going to be a sprite 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.590
 therefore you should add sprite here 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.390
 and I already have some characteristics of 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.390
 that sprite 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.060
 we will give direction D 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.289
 our example to the size of our 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.649
 example 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.439
 and a position now I'm going to define the 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:17.800
 anchor point that I do not want it to be 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.360
 the center that is the default is 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.460
 that is the center to me I like 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.360
 assign them with anchor point 0 0 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.610
 I find it easier to locate them from 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.800
 that way 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.230
 then the anchor point remember 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.440
 which is the point where 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.350
 where if I say sir of a 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.240
 position to an object the anchor point is 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.240
 the position that you are going to have 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.069
 is that point within the center of 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:53.449
 rectangle for example if I tell you 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.090
 let's imagine that this point in the scene 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.000
 is he is the 10 days if I tell him this 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.949
 polygon that go in the 10 10 the center 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.539
 of the 10.10 whale polygon because the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.060
 center of the polygon is the anchor 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:08.150
 default if I tell the polygon 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.680
 that your anchor is your 0.0 and then you 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.870
 I say that the position of that polygon is 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.330
 10 10 then it's going to be 10,10 here 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.340
 as it is now 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.590
 this sounds a bit complicated but one 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.360
 Once once they see it, it turns out 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.160
 rather easier then this what 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:30.240
 let's assign it at 0 0 and 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.240
 fill field set will be the gradient 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:40.300
 finally we have to tell the 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.560
 scene that inserts the sky in it 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.240
 and with that 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.240
 we have to open this file 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.290
 the browser 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.640
 we are going to open them and in chromium 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.800
 we have an error every time there is a 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.650
 mistake what you have to do is go see 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.730
 the console we press control shift and 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.730
 let's go to console 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.800
 then something there is something that I wrote 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.370
 I wrote badly clear it was not direction but 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.810
 that was reaction set 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.490
 and with that it should show 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.260
 then what I told them before the 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.800
 anchor point 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.280
 let's close with that is that if I 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.000
 eliminated the anchor point here now the 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.650
 anchor point is half of this I 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.840
 I 'm telling you half of that 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.040
 go in 00 then if I recharge 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.410
 this page look what is going to happen 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.910
 the rest was here, the rest is all 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.910
 hidden is all out of the game 

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:50.520
 and now I have this back, see that 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:50.520
 all this is going to move towards here
