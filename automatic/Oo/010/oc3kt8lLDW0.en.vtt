00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.199

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.410
 of colors from my vissum land and it 's 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.410
 precisely from Jalisco and has some 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.810
 very vivid tones not so vivid as unique 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.250
 or as bright as in the cove of 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.509
 chiapas this wall has very very shades 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.450
 bearable for everyone to make you 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.699
 natural makeup for every day or 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.679
 something dramatic because it has and black a
