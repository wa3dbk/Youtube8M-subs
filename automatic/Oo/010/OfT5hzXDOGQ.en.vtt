things<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
things you can do so we're gonna take a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
things you can do so we're gonna take a
look<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> programs<00:00:45.950> Lua<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
look at some of the programs Lua is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.779 
look at some of the programs Lua is
mainly<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.350> code<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> type<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.250> we're

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
mainly for code now you type in we're

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.400 
mainly for code now you type in we're
not<00:00:50.910> smart<00:00:51.600> enough<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
not smart enough to think of it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
not smart enough to think of it
ourselves<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.010> had<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> copy<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.610> yeah

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
ourselves so we had to copy it yeah

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520 
ourselves so we had to copy it yeah
we're<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:54.870> very<00:00:55.050> good<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
we're not we're not very good with the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
we're not we're not very good with the
code<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> stole<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.730> off<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
code so we kind of stole one off the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
code so we kind of stole one off the
forum<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.870> show<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.469> later

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
forum but will show you out that later

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
forum but will show you out that later
and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.340> red<00:00:59.579> probe<00:00:59.910> red<00:01:00.270> pulse<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and then there's red probe red pulse a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
and then there's red probe red pulse a
simple<00:01:01.440> program<00:01:01.800> where<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> type<00:01:02.399> hello

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
simple program where if you type hello

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
simple program where if you type hello
it<00:01:02.820> says<00:01:02.969> hello<00:01:03.239> world<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.110> course<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it says hello world and of course you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
it says hello world and of course you
could<00:01:04.619> program<00:01:04.799> many<00:01:05.189> things<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.729> Lua<00:01:05.970> because

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
could program many things in Lua because

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.780 
could program many things in Lua because
it's<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:07.260> close<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> c++<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.640> you're

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it's it's close to the c++ if you're

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's it's close to the c++ if you're
familiar<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> format<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.500> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
familiar with that format so what are we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
familiar with that format so what are we
doing<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.830> we're<00:01:11.670> gonna<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.030> can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
doing here we're gonna see if we can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.890 
doing here we're gonna see if we can
make<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> current<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.170> computer<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.790> the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
make a current to the computer and the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
make a current to the computer and the
red<00:01:15.900> probe<00:01:16.259> program<00:01:17.189> recognizes<00:01:18.000> current<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
red probe program recognizes current so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
red probe program recognizes current so
you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> says<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> input<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you can see it says the input is on the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840 
you can see it says the input is on the
left<00:01:20.700> side<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.900> useful<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.670> want

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
left side so that's useful with you want

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.010 
left side so that's useful with you want
to<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.420> people<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.930> gonna

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to make some I'm sure people are gonna

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.580 
to make some I'm sure people are gonna
make<00:01:25.229> ridiculous<00:01:25.920> things<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.759> mod<00:01:26.939> so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
make ridiculous things with this mod so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.410 
make ridiculous things with this mod so
now<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.860> send<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> pulse<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.299> this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
now we're gonna send a pulse to this

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.410 
now we're gonna send a pulse to this
block<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> spazz<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.360> what<00:01:33.360> do

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
block and make it spazz out so what do

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
block and make it spazz out so what do
you<00:01:33.479> say<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.439> put<00:01:34.680> maybe<00:01:35.329> 50.1

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you say but we're gonna put maybe 50.1

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
you say but we're gonna put maybe 50.1
seconds<00:01:36.659> apart<00:01:36.869> pulses<00:01:37.470> sounds<00:01:38.009> good<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.310> five

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
seconds apart pulses sounds good so five

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.810 
seconds apart pulses sounds good so five

overview<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.570> program<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.530> i

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
overview of the program so right now i

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
overview of the program so right now i
typed<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.159> red<00:01:53.340> poles<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.820> says<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> side

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
typed in red poles and it says the side

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
typed in red poles and it says the side
counting<00:01:55.049> period<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.549> specify<00:01:56.759> what

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
counting period so you can specify what

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.429 
counting period so you can specify what
you<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> click<00:01:58.170> help

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you want there and if you click help

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
you want there and if you click help
again<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.280> shows<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.700> some<00:02:00.329> things<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.810> right

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
again it shows you some things so right

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.389 
again it shows you some things so right
there<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.229> stole<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> default<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.189> just

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
there we stole the default we just

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
there we stole the default we just
switched<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.820> from<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.719> side<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
switched it from the right side to the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.960 
switched it from the right side to the
left<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.950> programs<00:02:08.670> roughly<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
left so we have programs roughly a

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.760 
left so we have programs roughly a
little<00:02:11.970> contraption<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.110> we'll

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
little contraption here so we'll

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.300 
little contraption here so we'll
go<00:02:13.920> jump<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.610> right<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.100> as<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
go jump into that right now so as you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.310 
go jump into that right now so as you
can<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.210> lovin<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.990> can't<00:02:19.200> get

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
can see we have some lovin we can't get

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.610 
can see we have some lovin we can't get
past<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.310> how'd<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.030> past<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.620> well

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
past so how'd you get past it well

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.460 
past so how'd you get past it well
here's<00:02:23.340> how<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:24.120> stole<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> function<00:02:25.110> for

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
here's how we stole a function for

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.620 
here's how we stole a function for
typing<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> password<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.330> still<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
typing a password and you still have to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350 
typing a password and you still have to
type<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.460> lock<00:02:29.460> because<00:02:29.790> i<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.240> have

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
type in lock because i do not have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.570 
type in lock because i do not have
changed<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.560> riddle<00:02:31.890> comes<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.310> so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
changed that but a riddle comes up so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.240 
changed that but a riddle comes up so
what<00:02:33.210> always<00:02:33.420> runs<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.080> never<00:02:34.230> walks<00:02:34.590> often

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
what always runs but never walks often

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.250 
what always runs but never walks often
murmurs<00:02:35.580> never<00:02:35.850> talks<00:02:36.180> has<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> bed<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:37.230> never

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
murmurs never talks has a bed but never

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800 
murmurs never talks has a bed but never
sleeps<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> has<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> mouth<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.060> never<00:02:39.360> eats

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
sleeps and has a mouth but never eats

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.010 
sleeps and has a mouth but never eats
pretty<00:02:40.710> sure<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> river<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.690> that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
pretty sure it's a river is it that

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.570 
pretty sure it's a river is it that
sounds<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> good<00:02:43.590> day<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.340> see

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
sounds like a good day so you can see

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.280 
sounds like a good day so you can see
when<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.850> enter<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.570> correctly<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:46.080> says

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
when you enter it correctly it says

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.280 
when you enter it correctly it says
success<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.270> run<00:02:48.450> past<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.050> lava

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
success and you get to run past the lava

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.280 
success and you get to run past the lava
and<00:02:49.590> escape<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.570> don't<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.660> why<00:02:51.780> we're<00:02:51.990> real

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and escape I don't know why we're real

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.590 
and escape I don't know why we're real
how<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:53.010> get<00:02:53.100> there<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.850> don't<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
how do we get there I don't know just

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.080 
how do we get there I don't know just
thought<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.130> happens<00:02:56.490> if<00:02:56.760> you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
thought of it but what happens if you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.270 
thought of it but what happens if you
don't<00:02:57.690> guess<00:02:58.020> successfully<00:02:58.740> let's<00:02:58.980> let's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
don't guess successfully let's let's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920 
don't guess successfully let's let's
take<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.520> look<00:02:59.670> at<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> don't

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
take a look at that so if you don't

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
take a look at that so if you don't
guess<00:03:01.050> correctly<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> little<00:03:01.980> trap

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
guess correctly we have a little trap

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.770 
guess correctly we have a little trap
set<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.240> would<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
set up for you so what would you say the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.660 
set up for you so what would you say the
answer<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:05.100> probably<00:03:05.310> not<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.460> fish

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
answer is not it's probably not a fish

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
answer is not it's probably not a fish
because<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.060> mouth<00:03:06.270> clearly<00:03:07.020> they<00:03:07.200> have

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
because that mouth clearly they have

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.350 
because that mouth clearly they have
mouths<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.460> probably<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.210> right

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
mouths and it's probably not the right

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.920 
mouths and it's probably not the right
answer<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.990> fail<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.100> fall<00:03:11.400> into<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:12.060> it's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
answer so fail and you fall into it it's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.570 
answer so fail and you fall into it it's
pretty<00:03:13.080> dark<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.680> these<00:03:13.770> signs<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:14.250> try

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
pretty dark and these signs they try

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
pretty dark and these signs they try
again<00:03:14.820> because<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.180> fail<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.780> riddles<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.500> in

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
again because you fail at riddles so in

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.199 
again because you fail at riddles so in
my<00:03:16.770> next<00:03:16.980> monitor<00:03:17.280> view<00:03:17.430> i'll<00:03:17.520> probably<00:03:17.880> be

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
my next monitor view i'll probably be

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.940 
my next monitor view i'll probably be
taking<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.600> look<00:03:18.750> at<00:03:18.959> better<00:03:19.230> than<00:03:19.470> wolves<00:03:19.650> so

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
taking a look at better than wolves so

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.230 
taking a look at better than wolves so
