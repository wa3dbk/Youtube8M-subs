all right so I cannot get the front clip
on<00:00:11.220> there<00:00:12.170> just<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> kind<00:00:13.680> of<00:00:13.800> visualize<00:00:14.250> more

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
on there just to kind of visualize more

work<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> back<00:00:17.670> here<00:00:18.470> needs<00:00:19.470> some

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
work in the back here needs some

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.570 
work in the back here needs some
tweaking<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> radiator<00:00:20.460> mounts<00:00:22.580> there's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
tweaking of the radiator mounts there's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.770 
tweaking of the radiator mounts there's
no<00:00:23.700> motor<00:00:23.940> in<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.360> that's<00:00:24.660> why

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
no motor in there right now that's why

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.850 
no motor in there right now that's why
it's<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.230> damn<00:00:25.619> high<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:27.470> was<00:00:28.470> planar<00:00:28.680> off

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
it's it's so damn high I was planar off

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's it's so damn high I was planar off
the<00:00:28.980> idea<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.240> adding<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.570> down<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the idea kind of adding on down here I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.890 
the idea kind of adding on down here I
get<00:00:32.369> eight<00:00:32.460> six<00:00:32.760> and<00:00:32.880> add<00:00:33.090> nine<00:00:33.270> six<00:00:33.600> inches

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
get eight six and add nine six inches

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.840 
get eight six and add nine six inches
but<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.070> might<00:00:35.220> be<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.520> work<00:00:35.700> than

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
but I don't all might be more work than

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.410 
but I don't all might be more work than
it's<00:00:35.970> worth

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's worth

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.490 
it's worth
because<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.930> look<00:00:39.140> can't<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.320> tell<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
because you look can't really tell but

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
because you look can't really tell but
notice<00:00:43.500> how<00:00:43.620> low<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:45.059> fender<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> bottoms<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
notice how low the fender the bottoms of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.250 
notice how low the fender the bottoms of
the<00:00:45.930> fenders<00:00:46.290> are<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.690> matches<00:00:49.050> right

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the fenders are this one matches right

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
the fenders are this one matches right
and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.339> up<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.580> front<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> on

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
and then you go up to the front and on
this<00:00:51.690> body<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.500> why<00:00:52.739> everything

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this body I don't know why everything

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.709 

we've<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:38.520> done<00:01:38.789> some<00:01:38.850> new<00:01:39.270> work<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
we've also done some new work on the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.050 
we've also done some new work on the
dash<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:41.039> rounded<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.490> corners<00:01:41.880> on

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
dash here you rounded the corners on

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.580 
dash here you rounded the corners on
that<00:01:42.270> where<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.810> cluster<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> sit

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that where the cluster is going to sit

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
that where the cluster is going to sit
so<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.859> has<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> oval<00:01:44.460> look<00:01:44.609> to<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.180> got

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so it has that oval look to it I got

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.569 
so it has that oval look to it I got
this<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:47.090> knob<00:01:48.090> thing<00:01:48.359> here<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this little knob thing here and then I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.940 
this little knob thing here and then I
made<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> flush<00:01:51.270> mount<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> radio<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
made a flush mount for the radio so the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.230 
made a flush mount for the radio so the
radio<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.429> mount<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> flush

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
radio is going to mount up this flush

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.169 
radio is going to mount up this flush
through<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:55.549> it'll<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.030> also

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
through there it'll look nice I'm also

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.550 
through there it'll look nice I'm also
going<00:01:57.359> to<00:01:57.420> round<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> corners<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.350> like

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
going to round the corners on this like

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to round the corners on this like
I<00:01:58.649> did<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.070> cluster<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.679> got<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
I did on the cluster and then we got the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.120 
I did on the cluster and then we got the
globe<00:02:02.100> box<00:02:02.399> back<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.649> before<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> set<00:02:04.979> up

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
globe box back here before it set up

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
globe box back here before it set up
against<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.700> flap<00:02:06.539> thing<00:02:06.780> right

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
against this little flap thing right

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.340 
against this little flap thing right
here

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
here

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
here
so<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> cut<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so it's cut off and it was just a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
so it's cut off and it was just a
straight<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.990> added<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
straight so we added this on so it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.510 
straight so we added this on so it
matches<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.700> other<00:02:12.450> side<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:13.310> little<00:02:14.310> good

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
matches the the other side a little good

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.570 
matches the the other side a little good
once<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:14.970> there

little<00:02:45.070> custom<00:02:45.640> housing<00:02:46.000> here<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.480> can

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
little custom housing here so it can

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
to be a little louvers in there so it's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.190 
to be a little louvers in there so it's
kind<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.540> bend<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:09.360> we<00:03:10.360> modified<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.840> took

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
kind of bend in we modified that took

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.130 
kind of bend in we modified that took
those<00:03:11.350> out<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:12.850> added<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.150> last<00:03:13.450> hole<00:03:13.660> give

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
those out we added this last hole give

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.630 
those out we added this last hole give
it<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.320> little<00:03:14.440> more<00:03:14.620> character<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.310> little

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
it a little more character a little

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.320 
it a little more character a little
different<00:03:15.970> than<00:03:16.090> everybody<00:03:16.270> else's<00:03:18.240> then<00:03:19.240> we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
different than everybody else's then we

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.480 
different than everybody else's then we
got<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> some<00:03:20.440> stainless<00:03:20.890> pieces<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.400> are

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
got a some stainless pieces that are

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.979 
got a some stainless pieces that are
gonna<00:03:21.610> go<00:03:21.760> on<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.000> inside<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.360> already<00:03:22.690> got<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
gonna go on the inside I already got the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.180 
gonna go on the inside I already got the
brackets<00:03:23.440> all<00:03:23.560> made<00:03:23.739> for<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
brackets all made for that and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.300 
brackets all made for that and
everything<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.680> think<00:03:26.709> that'll<00:03:27.130> make<00:03:27.280> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
everything so I think that'll make it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.270 
everything so I think that'll make it
look<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.610> little<00:03:27.700> bit<00:03:27.880> different<00:03:28.209> -<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.050> for<00:03:30.040> all

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
look a little bit different - so for all

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.699 
look a little bit different - so for all
about<00:03:30.550> making<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.360> different<00:03:34.560> can't<00:03:35.560> wait

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
about making it different can't wait

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.870 
about making it different can't wait
till<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.040> dropped<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.489> front<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.790> we

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
till it's dropped in the front and we

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.160 
till it's dropped in the front and we
can<00:03:36.910> see<00:03:37.209> how<00:03:37.330> it's<00:03:37.480> actually<00:03:37.600> going<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.959> sit

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
can see how it's actually going to sit

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.080 
can see how it's actually going to sit
I'm<00:03:38.890> liking<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.550> rear<00:03:39.730> right<00:03:39.910> now
