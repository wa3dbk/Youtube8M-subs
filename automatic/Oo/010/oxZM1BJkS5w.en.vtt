00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi guys today i will explain how 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.569
 insert custom songs in guitar hero 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 iii or our modified songs 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.150
 before starting to see how it's done 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.360
 I wanted to do to give you information 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.900
 on the terms and programs that we will find 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.820
 in the course of the video we will be useful 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 to insert our songs 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 I also remind you that all the programs 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:34.320
 or the terms I will tell you if there is something 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 from stock to download in the description 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 the links 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 then we start often you will find the item 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.329
 myths that are the keys that really 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.329
 play when you play the game 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can find these on the site 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 www.corriere.com then there is later 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 the main program as we will be 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.840
 Anglist editor always easily 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.670
 downloadable to discover 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.479
 then sometimes you will be 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 forced to use certain 2 mid 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.020
 which is a program that converts i 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 file point charting med 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.540
 this because because the turin to the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.090
 sometimes users lupano the songs ie 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.150
 the notes that came into this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.420
 size is chart and then warn them 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.710
 emiri so you can 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 use them in the song list editor program 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.479
 then no comment to address is the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 synchronism or rather consider that some 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.549
 once the songs you want to download it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.420
 they run in synchrony, that is, maybe 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:56.289
 you days the song is the is not a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:59.470
 time to avoid this users that 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.450
 throw midi or chart files write 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.399
 also the delay you have to put but 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.670
 absolutely not in song anyway 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.560
 you can set editor lists and then i 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.049
 pre requisites that you only need to know 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.290
 guitar hero iii in English I recommend 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.690
 The song list program does not work you 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.580
 installed patch 1.1 and the appropriate ones 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.400
 programs that I mentioned before that is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.930
 chart 2000 then I remind you also also 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.989
 that with this love with insertion 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.810
 of the songs will be deleted 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.120
 backup your backups then 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.720
 make a backup copy I make you 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.160
 probably see how to do it then 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.310
 entered the part of the documents e 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.579
 save the aspire folder where you want 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:55.510
 also enter the folder where 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:59.170
 you have installed guitar hero entered 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.989
 in data pack and here you will find two files 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:09.220
 which are called here they are called 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.140
 peup.pa point cubes save these then 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.840
 to allocate them once made in 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.769
 following the songs you take them and liri 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.220
 put me in. I don't think so 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.560
 responsible 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.530
 however, if you lose yours 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.530
 bailouts as I told you to do 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.150
 backup and now we move on to practice 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.830
 of how the songs are inserted into 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.790
 guitar hero 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.660
 open the program are those state 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.750
 this is not really this 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.930
 screen open files go to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.290
 paper is dated of guitar hero by now 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.290
 you should know 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.830
 tata fate ok on the left now suisse yes 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.120
 opens the list of songs present 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.580
 within the game 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.030
 momentarily rebel new song 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.620
 offensive new song I chose 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 welcome to the black parade of my 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.310
 chemical romance since the songs that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.070
 has a very long name 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.950
 you have to shorten it because it seems to me that 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:16.870
 the maximum is 18 16 characters so I will do 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:20.590
 a bother of joe in guitar track rhythms 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.080
 soundtrack drawn mp3 of the song 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.210
 Now if you plan this song 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.600
 it was a bitrate of 192k and will convert it to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.250
 128 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.760
 this is the practice against all the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.590
 I must have a bitrate of 128 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.540
 possibly that is not to be 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 constant and nothing now in preview 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.840
 positions 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.630
 this would be a preview that usually 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.220
 show on guitar hero in song songs 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.100
 of set 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.460
 this is what I was talking about before 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.590
 synchronism this time when 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.250
 unloaded song there was specially 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.510
 written that I had to pass an accused 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:07.990
 Those 750 seconds so we set it 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:11.290
 and now in midi file we are going to select 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.190
 the mini or the keys that we will then go to 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.190
 play on guitar hero 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.180
 here it is perfect 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.930
 courage that there are I want to show 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.400
 a moment how we used wet chart that 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:35.370
 it's very simple 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:37.470
 open it done once opened 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:43.259
 take a certain file if I am here 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.330
 on the desktop, open it 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.310
 here it says rock band but it's for rock 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.340
 band you have chitarrino so you do 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.460
 chitarrino task of rho and put it 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:04.490
 here is perfect and then insert them as 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:07.830
 I did see first now let's move on to 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.500
 end and buy this field again 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:16.810
 then title entered 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:20.080
 the name of the song then on artist and 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.800
 the name of the artist and have the year 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.800
 of the song 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:30.430
 these will be the data we will see when 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.580
 we will open the song inside the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.580
 game 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.510
 ok i'm copying the name of the song 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.060
 because it's too long for me to write 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:56.020
 it would take me too long I don't know 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:59.770
 says here nominate in the perfect north do 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.090
 ok you're doing a screen shot here 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.639
 is converting song 128k la sta 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.520
 preparing to insert it into the game 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.039
 wait for this process to finish e 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.719
 then we move on to 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:16.719
 to see what's next 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.129
 well now that first if finished will come 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:26.509
 written here you will see that there is written don 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:29.469
 don don and don create fsb now remains 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.469
 the last step to take
