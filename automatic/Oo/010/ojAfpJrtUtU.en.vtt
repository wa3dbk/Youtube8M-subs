reckless to task the biggest key is to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
reckless to task the biggest key is to

get that model retain its axis rotation

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
get that model retain its axis rotation
and<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.880> additive<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and that's what this additive in this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830 
and that's what this additive in this
ball<00:01:34.049> does<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.670> sure<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
ball does is it really make sure that

ball does is it really make sure that
that<00:01:37.320> ball<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.650> retaining<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.310> same<00:01:38.520> axis

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that ball is retaining the same axis

that ball is retaining the same axis
rotation<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> lane<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> changes

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
rotation down the lane and as it changes

rotation down the lane and as it changes
direction<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.210> why<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.420> ball<00:01:42.659> rolls
