00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.599
 users 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.839
 dellacasa as soon as it is a phone that combined special features there 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:27.519

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.899
 a teen titan body in fact call the resistant 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.429
 and the other armored quotation mark - detect had 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.479
 this movement I love in the evening post. 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.440
 and the phone is considered this metal shell of noble material indeed 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.070
 very very durable 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.030
 but the full coverage unfortunately is not the battery's rage 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.699
 iperclub manuals of that time 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.530
 is a phone that has already adopted it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.260
 pc suite as you see had 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.610
 the guide had the suite perfect tuning with the pc directly 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.920
 inside the cd data that supplied 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.320
 the phone opens a particular way - a part of the back cover one 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.409
 once opened 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 for in came 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 eliminated 108 open 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.450
 just 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.040
 the battery fits 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.759
 I already said that later 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850
 is locked up by 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.720
 its cover the plastic part was the part dedicated to the antennas for which 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.620
 we repeat the body of these photos was completely in titanium 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.909
 beautiful backlight I know if I can talk but it is 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.640
 of a zombie not very very clear then an evening backlight 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.689
 even those in the face of tuning on their phones that they were not 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.080
 at 80 '9 10 pm panasonic led tv 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.820
 to change the color of the keyboard to make the display look like 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 to this 89 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 for pc 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.190
 serious shutter release to finish corresponding to an amber call 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.380
 black of this phone made that the numbers were not backlit facts 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.549
 at night it was not easy to write a telephone message 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.299
 hum 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.929

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.039
 we already had 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:23.139
 a t9 and that worked very well obviously the keyboard a little bit 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.869
 recessed 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:31.879
 it didn't help to write messages that in fact alatest gives a difficult post 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.389
 from 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.720
 to compose 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.400
 the menu is very simple as you only see the up and down arrows 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.330
 low to move menus ninth messages now mind only text messages 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.049
 the heirs of the calls the ways of use 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.860
