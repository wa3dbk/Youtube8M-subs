they are going to try to supply parts
the<00:02:04.829> way<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> heard<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the way I heard it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.339 
the way I heard it
that<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.960> deep<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.069> bankruptcy<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
that they're so deep in bankruptcy that

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.199 
that they're so deep in bankruptcy that
they<00:02:10.349> won't<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.649> able<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.890> keep<00:02:11.009> their<00:02:11.370> parts

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
they won't be able to keep their parts

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
they won't be able to keep their parts
production<00:02:12.480> going

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
production going

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.240 
production going
so<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:15.230> don't<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.320> about<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.460> am<00:02:17.910> gonna

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
can find and he parked any engine

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.650 
can find and he parked any engine
whatever<00:02:25.860> whatever<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.910> wrong<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
whatever whatever is wrong with it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.630 
whatever whatever is wrong with it
whatever<00:02:28.110> has<00:02:28.260> been<00:02:28.290> done<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.250> good

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
whatever has been done to it it's good

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.550 
whatever has been done to it it's good
for<00:02:29.850> some<00:02:30.030> parts<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.100> gonna<00:02:32.100> need<00:02:32.370> them<00:02:32.520> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
for some parts and gonna need them it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.740 
for some parts and gonna need them it
seems<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.800> bigger<00:02:35.330> probably<00:02:36.330> had<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
seems like bigger probably had to go the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.510 
seems like bigger probably had to go the
way<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> Clinton<00:02:37.590> engine<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:40.490> lot<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
way of the Clinton engine and a lot of

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.680 
way of the Clinton engine and a lot of
us<00:02:41.730> know<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:43.400> Clinton<00:02:44.400> parts<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.150> getting

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
us know that Clinton parts are getting

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
us know that Clinton parts are getting
hard<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.020> come<00:02:46.290> by<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:47.070> mean<00:02:47.370> they've<00:02:47.580> been

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
hard to come by now I mean they've been

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.260 
hard to come by now I mean they've been
