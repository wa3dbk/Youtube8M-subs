same thing for flights climb that uses
the<00:01:02.780> barometer<00:01:03.289> inside<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:04.220> track<00:01:04.910> when<00:01:05.150> you

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
the barometer inside to track when you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.930 
the barometer inside to track when you
go<00:01:05.360> up<00:01:05.600> or<00:01:05.780> down<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:06.020> flight<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.380> stairs<00:01:06.910> so<00:01:07.910> you

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
go up or down a flight of stairs so you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.880 
go up or down a flight of stairs so you
can<00:01:08.090> see<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.570> my<00:01:08.720> daily<00:01:09.050> average<00:01:09.230> is<00:01:09.650> two
