Fahrenheit or minus 11 degrees Celsius

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.320 
Fahrenheit or minus 11 degrees Celsius
so<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:13.049> pretty<00:00:13.290> cold<00:00:13.469> outside

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330

and we've just been tumbled by a couple
of<00:00:18.090> feet<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.390> snow<00:00:18.830> as<00:00:19.830> well<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.900> freezing<00:00:21.900> rain

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
of feet of snow as well as freezing rain

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.429 
of feet of snow as well as freezing rain
you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> crystals<00:00:24.869> forming<00:00:25.289> on

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you can just see the crystals forming on

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
you can just see the crystals forming on
top<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> snow<00:00:25.920> bank<00:00:31.579> not<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:32.969> time

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
top of the snow bank not the first time

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.010 
top of the snow bank not the first time
I<00:00:33.180> ran<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:35.540> with<00:00:36.540> snow<00:00:36.780> and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
the snow melts usually that occurs

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:17.390 
the snow melts usually that occurs
mid-march<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.660> mid-april<00:01:05.090> alright<00:01:16.400> alright

so<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> finally<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> door<00:01:18.509> open

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 

oh<00:01:25.200> yes<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.070> you're<00:01:26.220> wondering<00:01:26.550> what<00:01:26.670> happened

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
oh yes if you're wondering what happened

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
oh yes if you're wondering what happened
to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> Mastercraft<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:28.170> actually

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to the Mastercraft that's actually

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.610 
to the Mastercraft that's actually
sitting<00:01:29.550> in<00:01:29.670> our<00:01:29.790> garage<00:01:30.229> there<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> big

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
sitting in our garage there was a big

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.540 
sitting in our garage there was a big
problem<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
problem with it

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.930 
problem with it
one<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> starter<00:01:33.540> motor<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> Bendix<00:01:35.700> came

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
one was a starter motor the Bendix came

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.020 
one was a starter motor the Bendix came
out<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.080> repaired<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.520> another<00:01:38.700> thing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
out but we repaired it but another thing

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
out but we repaired it but another thing
is<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.100> electrical

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
is just because it has electrical

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.660 
is just because it has electrical
features<00:01:42.060> such<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.750> chutes<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> problem

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
features such as the chutes the problem

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
features such as the chutes the problem
is<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.420> leave<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.440> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> cold

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
is if you leave it too much in the cold

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
is if you leave it too much in the cold
it<00:01:47.160> gets<00:01:47.340> frozen<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.420> doesn't<00:01:48.690> work

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it gets frozen and it doesn't work

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.580 
it gets frozen and it doesn't work
properly<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:50.690> actually<00:01:51.690> brought<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
properly and I actually brought it in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
properly and I actually brought it in
the<00:01:52.860> garage<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.490> let<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> warm<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the garage to let it warm up and then I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.770 
the garage to let it warm up and then I
tried<00:01:54.990> starting<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.850> yesterday<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.270> still<00:01:57.539> had

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
tried starting it yesterday it still had

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990 
tried starting it yesterday it still had
the<00:01:57.810> same<00:01:58.140> problem<00:01:58.590> what's<00:01:59.369> happened<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.970> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the same problem what's happened is that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.170 
the same problem what's happened is that
we<00:02:00.450> print<00:02:00.840> B+<00:02:01.320> into<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> magneto<00:02:02.820> into<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
we print B+ into the magneto into the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.630 
we print B+ into the magneto into the
current<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.649> getting<00:02:04.979> enough<00:02:05.280> current

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
current it's not getting enough current

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
current it's not getting enough current
it's<00:02:05.759> getting<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.119> maybe<00:02:06.479> 10<00:02:07.320> 11<00:02:07.350> volts<00:02:08.190> ins

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's getting like maybe 10 11 volts ins

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940 
it's getting like maybe 10 11 volts ins
of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> normal<00:02:09.030> 12<00:02:09.269> volts<00:02:09.570> so<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:10.769> you're

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
of the normal 12 volts so when you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.780 
of the normal 12 volts so when you're
pushing<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.730> chute<00:02:12.680> like<00:02:13.680> from<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> button

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pushing the chute like from a button

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.440 
pushing the chute like from a button
it's<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:16.220> very<00:02:17.220> slowly<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> left<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it's going very slowly to the left and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.520 
it's going very slowly to the left and
to<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.600> right<00:02:18.690> where<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.320> should<00:02:19.500> be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to the right where it should be

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.210 
to the right where it should be
operating<00:02:20.400> under<00:02:21.410> normal<00:02:22.410> space<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
operating under normal space so this is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.030 
operating under normal space so this is
why<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.970> having<00:02:24.870> manual<00:02:25.530> stuff<00:02:25.769> then

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
why I like having manual stuff then

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949 
why I like having manual stuff then
electronics<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.209> causes<00:02:27.630> too<00:02:27.810> much

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
electronics just causes too much

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.300 
electronics just causes too much
problems<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:30.650> there's<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.739> toro<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
problems so there's a toro that I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
problems so there's a toro that I
featured<00:02:34.610> about<00:02:35.610> two<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.150> three<00:02:36.180> weeks<00:02:36.510> ago<00:02:36.660> we

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
featured about two or three weeks ago we

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.870 
featured about two or three weeks ago we
started<00:02:37.230> first<00:02:37.470> first<00:02:37.769> time<00:02:37.950> although<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
started first first time although it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.550 
started first first time although it
took<00:02:39.060> some<00:02:39.360> while<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.750> get<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.989> going

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
took some while to get it going

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.460 
took some while to get it going
I<00:02:41.180> replaced<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> spark<00:02:42.600> plug<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:46.290> it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
I replaced the spark plug yeah it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.460 
I replaced the spark plug yeah it's
about<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.739> eight-year<00:02:47.040> old<00:02:47.070> spark<00:02:47.519> plug

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
about an eight-year old spark plug

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.110 
about an eight-year old spark plug
it's<00:02:49.470> RN<00:02:50.280> 4c<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> put<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:55.670> brand<00:02:56.670> new<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:57.030> in

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it's RN 4c so I put a brand new one in

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's RN 4c so I put a brand new one in
there<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.700> we'll<00:02:59.700> see<00:02:59.850> how<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> starts<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:01.070> I'm

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
there and we'll see how it starts so I'm

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.740 
there and we'll see how it starts so I'm
probably<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> pull<00:03:03.360> start<00:03:03.660> it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
probably not going to pull start it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.819 
probably not going to pull start it
because<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.170> probably<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.799> very

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
because it's probably going to be very

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.060 
because it's probably going to be very
stiff<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.579> as<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.989> minus<00:03:07.440> 11<00:03:07.799> degrees

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
stiff and as it is minus 11 degrees

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.350 
stiff and as it is minus 11 degrees
outside<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.260> let's<00:03:10.260> get<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:11.299> all<00:03:12.299> right

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
outside so let's get it going all right

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.720 
outside so let's get it going all right
so<00:03:12.600> let's<00:03:12.750> plugged<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:13.200> now
