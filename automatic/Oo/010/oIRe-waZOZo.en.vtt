00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
to the deluxe class version overall I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.670 
to the deluxe class version overall I
like<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.210> prime<00:02:25.450> figure<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.810> lot<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.350> think<00:02:26.590> it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
like the prime figure a lot I think it's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.640 
like the prime figure a lot I think it's
a<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:27.550> nifty<00:02:27.880> little<00:02:28.420> toy<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.440> think

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
a really nifty little toy and I think

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.930 
a really nifty little toy and I think
some<00:02:29.860> younger<00:02:30.190> kids<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.880> it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
some younger kids are going to like it

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.120 
some younger kids are going to like it
this<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.630> probably<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.320> little<00:02:32.560> bit<00:02:32.740> too

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
this is a probably a little bit too

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.900 
this is a probably a little bit too
small<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.480> really<00:02:35.200> young<00:02:35.440> kids<00:02:35.860> that's<00:02:36.730> what

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
small for really young kids that's what

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.120 
small for really young kids that's what
I<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.360> three-step<00:02:38.230> Transformers<00:02:38.980> are

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
I think the three-step Transformers are

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.060 
I think the three-step Transformers are
for<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.570> maybe<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.960> four<00:02:41.350> year<00:02:41.560> old<00:02:41.740> this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
for but for maybe a four year old this

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.620 
for but for maybe a four year old this
would<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.370> great<00:02:42.640> or<00:02:42.670> even<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.090> three<00:02:43.330> year<00:02:43.480> old

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
would be great or even a three year old

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.390 
would be great or even a three year old
