00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
now choose large spying map so what it
does<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.140> pretty<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.979> creates<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.820> map

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
does is pretty much it creates a map

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.530 
does is pretty much it creates a map
which<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.630> huge<00:01:10.049> biomes<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.820> loaded

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
which has huge biomes so I just loaded

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.170 
which has huge biomes so I just loaded
this<00:01:12.840> map<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> shows<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.280> part<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this map up so it shows a part of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.740 
this map up so it shows a part of the
snow<00:01:15.390> biome<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.549> trust<00:01:17.549> me<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.240> snow<00:01:18.509> biome

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
snow biome and trust me the snow biome

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.649 
snow biome and trust me the snow biome
is<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.290> least<00:01:19.680> three<00:01:20.250> times<00:01:20.490> bigger<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.060> what

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is at least three times bigger than what

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
is at least three times bigger than what
then<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> part<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> map<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
then the part that you see on this map I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.609 
then the part that you see on this map I
flew<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.970> complete<00:01:26.970> turn<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
flew one complete turn around it and it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.399 
flew one complete turn around it and it
took<00:01:28.829> me<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.159> almost<00:01:29.670> ten<00:01:29.970> minutes<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.990> yeah

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
took me like almost ten minutes so yeah

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
took me like almost ten minutes so yeah
bumps<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.189> pretty<00:01:32.579> huge<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.630> choose

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
bumps are pretty huge now if you choose

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520 
bumps are pretty huge now if you choose
that<00:01:34.590> thing<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.810> gotta<00:01:37.049> consider

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that thing but also you gotta consider

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.190 
that thing but also you gotta consider
that<00:01:37.860> seats<00:01:38.280> won't<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.600> that's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that seats won't be the same so that's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.190 
that seats won't be the same so that's
something<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> future

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
something to look out for in the future

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
something to look out for in the future
but<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.430> utter<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
but now let's get into the utter and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.760 
but now let's get into the utter and
truly<00:01:45.600> interesting<00:01:46.290> feature<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.479> think

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
truly interesting feature so I think

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.789 
truly interesting feature so I think
cocoanuts<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.220> been<00:01:50.460> edits<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.210> like

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
cocoanuts have been edits in like

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
cocoanuts have been edits in like
Minecraft<00:01:53.030> hmm<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.600> pita<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.939> even<00:01:56.939> alpha

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
Minecraft hmm I think pita or even alpha

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
Minecraft hmm I think pita or even alpha
but<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.049> least<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> pita<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.700> it's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
but at least in the pita and now it's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.979 
let's go to the normal mode real quick
game<00:02:20.010> mode<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:21.440> survival<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.720> yeah<00:02:24.720> at

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
game mode and then survival and yeah at

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.229 
game mode and then survival and yeah at
first<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.650> first<00:02:25.890> thing<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.310> realized<00:02:26.819> was

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
first the first thing I realized was

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.979 
first the first thing I realized was
these<00:02:28.080> trees<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.910> look<00:02:30.330> kinda<00:02:30.959> different

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
these trees so this look kinda different

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.619 
these trees so this look kinda different
than<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.709> normal<00:02:32.099> small<00:02:32.519> ones<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.299> not<00:02:33.599> a

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
than the normal small ones and not a

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.289 
than the normal small ones and not a
really<00:02:33.989> tall<00:02:34.230> ones<00:02:34.549> but<00:02:35.549> they<00:02:35.760> look<00:02:36.060> quite

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
really tall ones but they look quite

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.229 
really tall ones but they look quite
interesting<00:02:37.049> for<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> most<00:02:37.739> part<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.879> said

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
interesting for the most part but said

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.660 
interesting for the most part but said
that<00:02:39.269> seems<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> normal<00:02:40.349> tree<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:40.769> there

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
that seems like a normal tree but there

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.020 
that seems like a normal tree but there
are<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.239> nets<00:02:42.540> look<00:02:42.930> bitch<00:02:43.200> new<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.829> me<00:02:44.030> so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
now some of the channel trees the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.960 
now some of the channel trees the
smaller<00:02:47.970> ones<00:02:48.239> as<00:02:48.829> especially<00:02:49.829> will<00:02:50.730> have
