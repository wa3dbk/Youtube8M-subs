00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 It is guys in a long time I have 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.780
 willingness to use this magnetic cleaner 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.940
 Look how cool and I could not find it until 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 that I discovered in the super digital market 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.859
 an internet store that sells several 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 little things to the house that they sell and there 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.600
 I asked and now I'll show you 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 How cool is it because 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.970
 I was crazy to try and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 magnetic clean because in two parts 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.430
 and a part you put on the outside 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.430
 of the glass and the other part it has the same 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 here in the superpowerful medium you put 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 from the inside then it sticks and then I 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 I'm going to clean it from the outside and the side of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.070
 inside together I wanted this to be super 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.690
 cool work at home a lot of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 customers who live in super buildings 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 and the employees stay there 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 hanging to clean the ear for 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 inside and out and so you have a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 super security to clean only from the inside 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.940
 and it automatically cleans 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 out does not have to be hanging to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.310
 clean window panes 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.820
 Let's see how it works I get the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 cleaner it comes with it has two parts 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 one has a little twist here and it also has 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 a foam of content that even in the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.990
 box and they sent a replacement but 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 then you can buy in stores 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.479
 specialized cleaning supplies 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.549
 here I'll look just a little bit with 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.250
 very little water to prevent them from 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.240
 The water runs too much on the glass and I go 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 put one drop of detergent just to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.750
 help me clean scrub I'll look 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 another very little until the cast 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 and place in a detergent dispenser and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.950
 I spread then I will not 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 this part comes with a ring 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 line that I leave here because it 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.399
 That part fell there, right from the window. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 Stuck on my finger and I do not lose I go 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.730
 put here put more down 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.610
 guru of the stick there that I always use 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.020
 to up towards the felt're done 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.000
 here I push and turn and I will do this 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.360
 movement 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.170
 this movement is cleaning inside and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.800
 outside makes one piece at a time 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.930
 come back here the video gets super clean 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.790
 I put a lot you can put a 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.660
 a little water half 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.270
 then it's only you take comes worrying 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.620
 very dry and sure 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 on the outside and dry on the inside 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.880
 and then if you can not reach the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.970
 VIDEO People watch how it gets super 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.500
 He but if you can not reach 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.330

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.489

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.489
