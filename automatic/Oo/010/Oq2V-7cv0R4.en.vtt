should fall directly between your feet

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
should fall directly between your feet
as<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.430> step<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> should<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.449> pop<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
ball back into your hands think of this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.279

as<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> drop<00:00:57.300> step<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> instead<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> going

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
as a drop step and instead of going

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
as a drop step and instead of going
baseline<00:00:58.890> toward<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> hoop<00:00:59.640> you're<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.359> to

baseline toward the hoop you're going to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880

the middle to get a shot in the paint

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
the middle to get a shot in the paint
now<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> want<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.489> first<00:01:02.850> step<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> open<00:01:03.629> up

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
