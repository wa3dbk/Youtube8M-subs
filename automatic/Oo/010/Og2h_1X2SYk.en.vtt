USB and overall the build quality is
quite<00:00:15.870> good<00:00:16.160> there's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:19.369> vent<00:00:20.369> type

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
quite good there's a little vent type

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
quite good there's a little vent type
thing<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.390> some<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.840> holes<00:00:21.990> hopefully

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
thing here some little holes hopefully

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.290 
thing here some little holes hopefully
that's<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> speaker<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
that's for the speaker and not for the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.060 
that's for the speaker and not for the
microphone<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.260> then<00:00:25.320> there's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> little<00:00:25.949> one

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
microphone and then there's a little one

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.300 
microphone and then there's a little one
up<00:00:26.220> there<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.670> well<00:00:26.970> which<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:28.039> probably<00:00:29.039> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
up there as well which is probably for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759 
up there as well which is probably for
the<00:00:29.369> mic<00:00:30.230> otherwise<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the mic otherwise if that's the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.200 
the mic otherwise if that's the
microphone<00:00:31.980> you'd<00:00:32.489> probably<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.910> rubbing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
microphone you'd probably be rubbing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
microphone you'd probably be rubbing
your<00:00:33.559> hand<00:00:34.559> across<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.640> where

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
your hand across it I don't know where

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.150 
your hand across it I don't know where
I'll<00:00:36.059> show<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.719> camera

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.700 

yeah<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.700> overall<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.540> quite<00:00:42.840> good<00:00:42.870> I'm

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
yeah so overall it's quite good I'm

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.479 
yeah so overall it's quite good I'm
going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:46.789> size<00:00:47.789> comparison<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> now

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
going to do a size comparison for it now

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
going to do a size comparison for it now
compared<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:51.510> original<00:00:52.460> pocket<00:00:53.460> camcorder

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
compared to my original pocket camcorder

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.910 
compared to my original pocket camcorder
which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> samsung<00:00:55.199> u10<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
which is a samsung u10 and to do that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.950 
which is a samsung u10 and to do that
I'm<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.760> do<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.480> video<00:01:00.949> with<00:01:01.949> my

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
I'm just gonna do some video with my

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
I'm just gonna do some video with my
digital<00:01:03.960> camera<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.689> picture<00:01:06.689> quality<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
digital camera so the picture quality is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.190 
digital camera so the picture quality is
probably<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> change<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.869> will

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
probably going to change and I will

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480 
probably going to change and I will
switch<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
switch over to that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.920 
switch over to that
now<00:01:15.979> alright<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.570> with

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
now alright so here is side to side with

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.160 
now alright so here is side to side with
my<00:01:19.759> original<00:01:20.990> pocket<00:01:21.990> camcorder<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.920> Samsung

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
my original pocket camcorder the Samsung

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.179 
my original pocket camcorder the Samsung
u10<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:25.770> pretty<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> same<00:01:28.189> size

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
u10 they're pretty much the same size

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.749 
u10 they're pretty much the same size
this<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:31.170> height<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> width<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this way the height and width of them is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.899 
this way the height and width of them is
quite<00:01:33.770> equal<00:01:36.680> sony<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:38.040> thicker<00:01:38.340> but

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
quite equal sony is a lot thicker but

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.929 
quite equal sony is a lot thicker but
obviously<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> needs<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.229> because

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
obviously it needs to be because

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.310 
obviously it needs to be because
compared<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> screen<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
compared to this with the screen on the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.420 
compared to this with the screen on the
back<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.990> stuff<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.979> has

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
back and all the stuff there this has

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.370 
back and all the stuff there this has
the<00:01:48.180> main<00:01:49.049> buttons<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.040> rear<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
the main buttons on the rear there and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.450 
the main buttons on the rear there and
pop-out<00:01:52.380> screen<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:54.860> actually<00:01:55.860> see

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
pop-out screen so you can actually see

yourself if you're filming if that's

yourself if you're filming if that's
what<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.310> prefer<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:00.990> compared<00:02:01.409> to

what you prefer to do where compared to

what you prefer to do where compared to
this<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.920> can't<00:02:02.540> obviously<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:04.369> where<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
this you can't obviously see where the

this you can't obviously see where the

tiny little bit on the center there it's

tiny little bit on the center there it's
a<00:02:22.360> bit<00:02:22.540> misleading<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.380> camera<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.760> lens

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
a bit misleading this camera on lens

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.650 
a bit misleading this camera on lens
size<00:02:25.780> i<00:02:26.050> pre-ordered<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.270> i<00:02:28.270> assumed

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
that there wasn't very much information

pre-ordered it assuming that that whole

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
black area there was the lens and it

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.900 
black area there was the lens and it
obviously<00:02:41.230> turned<00:02:41.830> out<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.460> this<00:02:42.760> is

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
obviously turned out not to be this is

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.910 
obviously turned out not to be this is
pretty<00:02:43.450> much<00:02:43.570> similar<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> size<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.680> lens

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
pretty much similar to the size of lens

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
pretty much similar to the size of lens
you<00:02:45.100> would<00:02:45.220> get<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.960> phone<00:02:47.320> these<00:02:47.710> days

it<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.990> Sony<00:03:02.230> Bloggie<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.740> just<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.220> 5

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
it the Sony Bloggie is just a 5

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.240 
it the Sony Bloggie is just a 5
megapixel<00:03:04.060> compared<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.170> Samsung<00:03:05.800> u10

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
megapixel compared to the Samsung u10

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
megapixel compared to the Samsung u10
which<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.560> 10<00:03:08.560> megapixel<00:03:08.920> camera<00:03:09.700> but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
which is a 10 megapixel camera but

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.440 
which is a 10 megapixel camera but
because<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.800> size<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.430> 10<00:03:12.820> megapixel

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
because of the size of the 10 megapixel

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.640 
because of the size of the 10 megapixel
images<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:16.180> takes<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.750> long<00:03:16.930> time<00:03:16.959> for<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
images it takes a long time for the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.320 
images it takes a long time for the
inner<00:03:19.050> processor<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.640> actually

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
inner processor in that one to actually

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.680 
inner processor in that one to actually
process<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.020> images<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:25.060> end<00:03:25.240> up<00:03:25.390> with

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
process the images and you end up with

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.040 
process the images and you end up with
very<00:03:25.720> blurry<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:27.190> very<00:03:27.400> good<00:03:27.640> pictures<00:03:28.150> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
very blurry not very good pictures the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.890 
very blurry not very good pictures the
pictures<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.910> camera<00:03:31.209> are<00:03:31.450> only<00:03:31.630> really

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
pictures on this camera are only really

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.080 
pictures on this camera are only really
very<00:03:32.200> good<00:03:32.470> once<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.630> take<00:03:34.630> down<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:36.090> tape

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
very good once you take down the tape

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.570 
very good once you take down the tape
the<00:03:37.360> settings<00:03:37.750> down<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> roughly<00:03:39.070> about<00:03:39.160> 5

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
the settings down to a roughly about 5

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.130 
the settings down to a roughly about 5
megapixels<00:03:40.440> which<00:03:42.720> would<00:03:43.720> put<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.020> pretty

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
megapixels which would put it pretty

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.690 
megapixels which would put it pretty
similar<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.890> although<00:03:45.100> obviously

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
similar to that although obviously

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.080 
similar to that although obviously
because<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.510> size<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.959> lens<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.620> one

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
because the size of the lens of this one

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.060 
because the size of the lens of this one
the<00:03:49.230> pictures<00:03:50.230> will<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.470> much<00:03:51.100> nicer<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.770> as<00:03:53.770> a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
the pictures will be much nicer so as a

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.060 
the pictures will be much nicer so as a
size<00:03:54.400> comparison<00:03:55.590> there<00:03:56.590> we<00:03:56.709> go<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.420> paid<00:03:59.070> 150

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
size comparison there we go I paid 150

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.530 
size comparison there we go I paid 150
for<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.820> Sony<00:04:01.090> Bloggie<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:04.150> when

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
for the Sony Bloggie and I think when

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.360 
for the Sony Bloggie and I think when
the<00:04:04.810> Samsung<00:04:05.440> u10<00:04:05.860> came<00:04:06.190> out<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.430> paid<00:04:06.970> about

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
the Samsung u10 came out I paid about

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.060 
the Samsung u10 came out I paid about
what<00:04:09.370> was<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.640> about<00:04:10.110> 140<00:04:11.110> but<00:04:11.830> the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
what was it about 140 but the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.970 
what was it about 140 but the
recommended<00:04:12.940> price<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.720> Bloggie<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.560> more

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
recommended price on the Bloggie is more

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.479 
recommended price on the Bloggie is more
like<00:04:15.220> 180<00:04:15.940> pounds<00:04:16.510> at<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.560> moment<00:04:17.979> that<00:04:18.310> I

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
like 180 pounds at the moment that I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
I've I had both of these already I

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.080 
I've I had both of these already I
didn't<00:04:46.270> go<00:04:46.390> out<00:04:46.420> specifically<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.790> buy<00:04:48.790> them

didn't go out specifically to buy them
but<00:04:49.360> it's<00:04:51.180> quite<00:04:52.180> good<00:04:52.510> I'm<00:04:52.750> sure<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.320> the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
but it's quite good I'm sure that the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.380 
but it's quite good I'm sure that the
main<00:04:53.710> reason<00:04:54.190> was<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.640> lot<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.910> people<00:04:55.240> get

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
you have to use the memory sticks and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.670 
you have to use the memory sticks and
they<00:05:00.730> are<00:05:00.910> quite<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.660> lot<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:01.990> expensive<00:05:02.380> than

Sony<00:05:32.140> Ericsson<00:05:32.650> phone<00:05:32.920> ahead<00:05:33.100> which<00:05:33.670> ended<00:05:34.660> up

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
Sony Ericsson phone ahead which ended up

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.690 
Sony Ericsson phone ahead which ended up
breaking<00:05:35.020> before<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.650> even<00:05:35.740> got<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.100> chance<00:05:36.310> to

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
breaking before I even got the chance to

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.370 
breaking before I even got the chance to
put<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:39.550> SD<00:05:40.420> card<00:05:40.750> I<00:05:41.050> already

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
put it in it and the SD card I already

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.080 
put it in it and the SD card I already
had<00:05:41.530> as<00:05:41.890> a<00:05:41.950> spare<00:05:42.580> for<00:05:43.020> my<00:05:44.280> original<00:05:45.280> camera

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
had as a spare for my original camera

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.410 
had as a spare for my original camera
the<00:05:46.870> Sony<00:05:47.380> Bloggie<00:05:47.770> actually<00:05:48.490> does<00:05:48.760> have<00:05:49.120> a

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
the Sony Bloggie actually does have a

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.800 
the Sony Bloggie actually does have a
tiny<00:05:50.260> amount<00:05:51.100> of<00:05:51.520> memory<00:05:52.090> in<00:05:52.210> it<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.450> don't<00:05:52.600> know

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
tiny amount of memory in it I don't know

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.320 
tiny amount of memory in it I don't know
if<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.140> focusing<00:05:53.950> but<00:05:55.200> set<00:05:56.200> at<00:05:56.410> 5

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
if this is focusing but set at 5

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.790 
if this is focusing but set at 5
megapixels<00:05:59.460> you<00:06:00.460> have<00:06:01.080> enough<00:06:02.080> memory<00:06:02.380> to

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
megapixels you have enough memory to

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.210 
megapixels you have enough memory to
take<00:06:05.010> 8<00:06:06.010> photos<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.420> with<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.290> video<00:06:08.560> set<00:06:09.010> at

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
take 8 photos and with the video set at

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.370 
take 8 photos and with the video set at
seven<00:06:09.790> twenty<00:06:10.950> thirty<00:06:11.950> P<00:06:12.600> you<00:06:13.600> have<00:06:13.900> enough

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
seven twenty thirty P you have enough

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.490 
seven twenty thirty P you have enough
memory<00:06:14.920> to<00:06:16.560> recall<00:06:17.820> 41<00:06:18.820> seconds<00:06:19.510> of<00:06:19.750> video<00:06:19.900> so

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
memory to recall 41 seconds of video so

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.470 
memory to recall 41 seconds of video so
really<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.310> internal<00:06:21.820> memory<00:06:22.120> on<00:06:22.270> this

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
really the internal memory on this

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.790 
really the internal memory on this
cameras<00:06:23.940> quite<00:06:24.940> useless<00:06:25.360> but<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:26.140> suppose<00:06:26.590> in

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
cameras quite useless but I suppose in

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.630 
cameras quite useless but I suppose in
the<00:06:27.430> case<00:06:27.520> of<00:06:27.820> emergencies<00:06:28.710> you<00:06:29.710> would<00:06:30.130> at

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
the case of emergencies you would at

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.559 
the case of emergencies you would at
least<00:06:30.700> be<00:06:31.180> able<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.600> get<00:06:31.780> a<00:06:31.810> cup<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.230> shot

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
least be able to get a cup of shot

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.100 
least be able to get a cup of shot
so<00:06:32.719> for<00:06:33.080> record<00:06:33.469> a<00:06:33.589> tiny<00:06:33.860> little<00:06:34.099> amount<00:06:35.110> it's

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
so for record a tiny little amount it's

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.929 
so for record a tiny little amount it's
very<00:06:36.319> good<00:06:36.589> though<00:06:36.860> I<00:06:36.889> think<00:06:37.009> that<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.639> can

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:37.939 
very good though I think that you can

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.629 
very good though I think that you can
actually<00:06:38.240> have<00:06:38.689> the<00:06:38.839> choice<00:06:39.110> between<00:06:39.639> what

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
actually have the choice between what

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.609 
actually have the choice between what
you<00:06:40.759> put<00:06:40.969> in<00:06:41.089> there<00:06:41.330> it<00:06:41.569> makes<00:06:41.899> the<00:06:42.169> Sony

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:42.619 
you put in there it makes the Sony

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:46.209 
you put in there it makes the Sony
Bloggie<00:06:43.339> z--<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:43.939> I<00:06:44.629> assume<00:06:45.229> all<00:06:45.889> future

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219 
Bloggie z-- and I assume all future

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.909 
Bloggie z-- and I assume all future
cameras<00:06:47.179> will<00:06:47.419> have<00:06:47.929> this<00:06:48.110> feature<00:06:48.379> as<00:06:48.709> well

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
cameras will have this feature as well

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.369 
cameras will have this feature as well
it<00:06:49.610> makes<00:06:49.879> them<00:06:50.209> more<00:06:50.419> easily<00:06:50.569> accessible<00:06:51.349> to

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
it makes them more easily accessible to

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.769 
it makes them more easily accessible to
most<00:06:51.679> people<00:06:52.189> because<00:06:52.369> a<00:06:52.789> lot<00:06:52.999> of<00:06:53.029> the<00:06:53.179> time<00:06:53.419> I

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:53.779 
most people because a lot of the time I

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.109 
most people because a lot of the time I
don't<00:06:54.529> think<00:06:54.770> people<00:06:54.949> very<00:06:55.369> interested<00:06:55.459> in

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:56.119 
don't think people very interested in

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.980 
don't think people very interested in
spendings<00:06:56.689> or<00:06:57.309> 30-something<00:06:58.309> pounds<00:06:58.849> on<00:06:59.179> a

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
spendings or 30-something pounds on a

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.959 
spendings or 30-something pounds on a
pro<00:07:00.529> duo<00:07:00.830> when<00:07:01.189> you<00:07:01.309> can<00:07:01.520> get<00:07:01.699> something

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:01.969 
pro duo when you can get something

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:05.230 
pro duo when you can get something
probably<00:07:02.449> double<00:07:02.779> the<00:07:02.869> capacity<00:07:03.099> with<00:07:04.240> SDHC

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
probably double the capacity with SDHC

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.739 
probably double the capacity with SDHC
card<00:07:05.559> but<00:07:06.559> there<00:07:06.949> we<00:07:07.039> go<00:07:07.219> just<00:07:07.749> another

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749 
card but there we go just another

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:12.909 
card but there we go just another
interesting<00:07:08.990> thing<00:07:09.939> the<00:07:11.139> vlog<00:07:12.139> e<00:07:12.169> heads<00:07:12.529> to<00:07:12.800> it

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
interesting thing the vlog e heads to it

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:19.420 
interesting thing the vlog e heads to it
and<00:07:13.270> I<00:07:15.669> think<00:07:16.669> now<00:07:16.939> I<00:07:17.300> just<00:07:17.419> have<00:07:17.869> to<00:07:18.369> make<00:07:19.369> a

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
and I think now I just have to make a

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.290 
and I think now I just have to make a
decision<00:07:19.789> stick<00:07:20.300> one<00:07:20.449> of<00:07:20.539> these<00:07:20.689> cards<00:07:21.020> in<00:07:21.379> and

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
decision stick one of these cards in and

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.309 
decision stick one of these cards in and
get<00:07:23.300> on<00:07:23.479> with<00:07:23.509> some<00:07:24.110> test<00:07:24.769> video<00:07:25.300> I<00:07:26.300> don't<00:07:27.019> know

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 
get on with some test video I don't know

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:30.459 
get on with some test video I don't know
when<00:07:27.709> I<00:07:28.039> would<00:07:28.189> be<00:07:28.849> sticking<00:07:29.479> up<00:07:29.749> any<00:07:29.959> test

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:30.469 
when I would be sticking up any test

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.999 
when I would be sticking up any test
video<00:07:30.830> if<00:07:31.610> anyone<00:07:31.999> has<00:07:32.119> any<00:07:32.709> preferences<00:07:33.709> on
