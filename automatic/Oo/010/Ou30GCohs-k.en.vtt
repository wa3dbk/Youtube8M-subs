few of them and there were only nine
million<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:20.220> happened<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
million so what happened what what the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
million so what happened what what the
 is<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.800> it<00:00:22.800> cannot<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
 is this it cannot be because of the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
 is this it cannot be because of the
tool<00:00:24.180> belt<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
tool belt because this was because of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.259 
tool belt because this was because of
tool<00:00:26.910> belt<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> crashed<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.670> then<00:00:29.670> they

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
tool belt then it crashed and then they

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.709 
tool belt then it crashed and then they
went<00:00:30.449> back<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:31.579> it<00:00:32.579> probably<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
went back up it probably is because of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
went back up it probably is because of
the<00:00:33.960> bots<00:00:34.200> maybe<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.010> working<00:00:35.040> now

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the bots maybe they are not working now

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
the bots maybe they are not working now
because<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> new<00:00:36.270> interfaces<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
because of the new interfaces that is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
because of the new interfaces that is
just<00:00:38.100> my<00:00:38.280> guess<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:39.510> yeah<00:00:39.750> currently<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
just my guess but yeah currently it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
just my guess but yeah currently it's
really<00:00:41.070> good<00:00:41.219> money<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.910> ahead<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
really good money so go ahead and go and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
really good money so go ahead and go and
try<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.590> diamond<00:00:44.040> pickaxes<00:00:44.610> they

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
try to get some diamond pickaxes they

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
try to get some diamond pickaxes they
are<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> kill

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
are not that there because you can kill

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.970 
are not that there because you can kill
the<00:00:47.250> count<00:00:47.730> 12<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.510> fast<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the count 12 really fast right now so so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.529 
the count 12 really fast right now so so
it's<00:00:50.100> been<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> while<00:00:50.489> since<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.090> peak

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's been a while since I actually peak

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's been a while since I actually peak
eight<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> decided<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.340> wilderness

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
eight so I decided to go into wilderness

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
eight so I decided to go into wilderness
right<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.379> been<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.739> eight

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
right now I think it's been like eight

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
right now I think it's been like eight
months<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.660> took<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.350> random

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
months now and I just took like random

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.639 
months now and I just took like random
girl<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.579> bank<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.109> Tatsu

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
speaking and it's not because I was like

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.920 
speaking and it's not because I was like
