change them they're like a paperclip
they<00:03:09.400> designed<00:03:09.819> them<00:03:09.940> once<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.359> that<00:03:10.480> was<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
they designed them once and that was it

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.319 
they designed them once and that was it
now<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.129> these<00:03:12.220> free<00:03:12.489> tips<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.209> either

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
now on these free tips you can either

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.650 
now on these free tips you can either
spray<00:03:13.720> them<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.829> way<00:03:15.120> which<00:03:16.120> means<00:03:16.419> that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
spray them this way which means that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.939 
spray them this way which means that
that<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.739> line<00:03:18.310> will<00:03:18.549> be<00:03:18.669> up<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.540> down<00:03:19.900> or<00:03:20.230> you

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
that the line will be up and down or you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.710 
that the line will be up and down or you
can<00:03:21.099> spray<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:21.549> way<00:03:21.790> which<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.359> line<00:03:22.569> will

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
can spray this way which the line will

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.039 
can spray this way which the line will
be<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:22.959> way<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.949> way<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
be this way and this way you have to

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.280 
be this way and this way you have to
make<00:03:26.199> sure<00:03:26.349> your<00:03:26.560> holes<00:03:26.799> are<00:03:26.980> clean<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:29.139> this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
make sure your holes are clean so this

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.580 
make sure your holes are clean so this
is<00:03:29.319> made<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.680> brass<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.489> not<00:03:30.639> want<00:03:31.060> to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
is made of brass so you do not want to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.020 
is made of brass so you do not want to
refine<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.739> or<00:03:32.889> anything<00:03:33.099> most<00:03:33.669> things<00:03:33.940> are

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.479 
refine it or anything most things are
made<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.329> brass<00:03:34.510> because<00:03:35.049> they<00:03:35.169> can<00:03:35.319> be

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
they're nozzles can be fitted and this

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.680 
they're nozzles can be fitted and this
has<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.819> very<00:03:42.819> pain<00:03:43.419> in<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.690> ass<00:03:44.340> weight<00:03:45.690> ratio

on<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.989> back<00:03:47.169> of<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.819> hard<00:03:49.060> for<00:03:49.209> me<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
on the back of it it's hard for me to

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.050 
on the back of it it's hard for me to
load<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.629> up<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:51.160> way<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:51.639> to<00:03:51.669> shoot<00:03:51.910> it

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
load it up the way I like to shoot it

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.170 
load it up the way I like to shoot it
though<00:03:52.239> is

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.000 

like<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:59.079> put<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.109> little<00:04:00.260> bit<00:04:00.469> of<00:04:00.530> reducer

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
like this I put a little bit of reducer

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.910 
like this I put a little bit of reducer
in<00:04:01.129> there<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.900> get<00:04:02.900> my<00:04:03.019> air<00:04:03.140> pressure<00:04:03.349> set<00:04:03.709> I

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
in there I get my air pressure set I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.610 
in there I get my air pressure set I
check<00:04:04.609> my<00:04:04.790> pattern<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.359> a<00:04:05.599> piece<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.900> cardboard

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
check my pattern on a piece of cardboard

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.789 
check my pattern on a piece of cardboard
or<00:04:07.040> something<00:04:07.689> and<00:04:08.689> I<00:04:09.079> can<00:04:09.260> adjust<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.680> air

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
or something and I can adjust the air

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.929 
or something and I can adjust the air
pressure<00:04:09.950> here<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:11.299> adjust<00:04:11.659> my<00:04:11.810> pattern

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
pressure here I can adjust my pattern

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.779 
pressure here I can adjust my pattern
amount<00:04:13.939> here<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.950> all<00:04:15.950> guns<00:04:16.190> have<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.549> same

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
amount here and all guns have the same

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.849 
amount here and all guns have the same
thing<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.900> either<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:21.019> have<00:04:21.199> you<00:04:21.530> have<00:04:21.650> two

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
thing it's either you have you have two

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.610 
thing it's either you have you have two
nozzles<00:04:22.070> one<00:04:22.820> controls<00:04:23.710> how<00:04:24.710> much<00:04:26.259> fluid<00:04:27.259> is

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
nozzles one controls how much fluid is

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.279 
nozzles one controls how much fluid is
going<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> tip<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.870> other<00:04:30.050> one

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
going to the tip and the other one

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.800 
going to the tip and the other one
controls<00:04:30.740> pattern<00:04:31.250> how<00:04:31.370> narrow<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.910> want<00:04:32.120> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
controls pattern how narrow you want the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.390 
controls pattern how narrow you want the
what<00:04:33.199> i<00:04:33.229> mean<00:04:33.410> by<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.650> pattern<00:04:34.099> is<00:04:34.250> it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
what i mean by the pattern is it

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.640 
what i mean by the pattern is it
normally<00:04:34.759> shoots<00:04:35.000> out<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> pattern<00:04:35.539> it<00:04:36.500> looks

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
normally shoots out a pattern it looks

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.370 
normally shoots out a pattern it looks
like<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.830> weird<00:04:37.160> looking<00:04:37.460> egg<00:04:37.759> shell<00:04:38.090> here<00:04:38.660> like

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
like a weird looking egg shell here like

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.890 
like a weird looking egg shell here like
this<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:40.340> if<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.699> turn<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> knob<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.780> can

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
this but if you turn in the knob you can

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.749 
this but if you turn in the knob you can
get<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.110> pattern<00:04:42.320> smaller<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.979> smaller<00:04:43.130> to

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
get the pattern smaller and smaller to

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.909 
get the pattern smaller and smaller to
where<00:04:43.910> it's<00:04:44.030> just<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.330> round<00:04:44.599> dot<00:04:44.889> depends<00:04:45.889> on

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
where it's just a round dot depends on

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.240 
where it's just a round dot depends on
what<00:04:46.039> you<00:04:46.160> need<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.460> for<00:04:47.919> but<00:04:48.919> we're<00:04:49.039> going<00:04:49.160> to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
what you need it for but we're going to

about<00:05:09.020> professional<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:10.250> we<00:05:10.400> strain<00:05:10.729> every

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
about professional so we strain every

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.460 
about professional so we strain every
one<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.389> these<00:05:11.860> into<00:05:12.860> different<00:05:13.669> little<00:05:13.849> cups

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
that give us our proportion for whatever

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.260 
that give us our proportion for whatever
we<00:05:18.229> look<00:05:18.380> at<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.590> job<00:05:19.310> how<00:05:19.669> much<00:05:19.849> we<00:05:20.060> think

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.460 
we look at the job how much we think
we're<00:05:20.389> going<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.599> need<00:05:20.770> for<00:05:21.770> three<00:05:24.580> coats<00:05:25.580> and

we're going to need for three coats and

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.420 
we're going to need for three coats and
then<00:05:27.470> clean<00:05:27.740> up<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.099> that's<00:05:28.220> it
