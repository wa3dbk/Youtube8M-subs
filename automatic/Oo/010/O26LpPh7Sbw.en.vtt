normal a good cast iron pan will be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
normal a good cast iron pan will be
milled<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.900> flat<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.449> then<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
milled so that it's flat and then you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
milled so that it's flat and then you
can<00:00:24.840> season<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> it'll<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.160> much<00:00:26.400> more

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
can season it up and it'll be much more

puppy<00:00:30.050> cool<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.350> highest<00:00:31.650> spots<00:00:31.949> are

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
puppy cool the highest spots are

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.290 
puppy cool the highest spots are
starting<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:34.340> milled<00:00:35.340> down<00:00:35.820> by<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
starting to get milled down by the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.229 
starting to get milled down by the
sanding<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.980> only<00:00:38.100> took<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> moment<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.000> do

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

sticker
that<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.659> enormously<00:01:21.649> better<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.310> as<00:01:22.939> the

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
that is enormously better and as the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.590 
that is enormously better and as the
seasoning<00:01:24.140> progresses<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.909> will<00:01:26.090> get<00:01:26.270> even

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
seasoning progresses that will get even

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.550 
seasoning progresses that will get even
better<00:01:28.420> sanding<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.569> definitely<00:01:30.170> did<00:01:30.409> the

better sanding it definitely did the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.600 
better sanding it definitely did the
trick<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.859> quick<00:01:34.039> word<00:01:34.399> about

and and then it'll dry out completely
and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:28.730> heat<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.420> little<00:02:29.720> bit<00:02:29.989> of

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
and then you heat it up a little bit of

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:42.050 
and then you heat it up a little bit of
oil

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.820 

and<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.810> pan<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.349> ready<00:02:43.380> for

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
and the pan is ready for

and the pan is ready for
ready<00:02:45.460> for<00:02:45.730> reuse<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.870> takes<00:02:47.110> almost<00:02:47.950> no

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
ready for reuse then it takes almost no

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
ready for reuse then it takes almost no
time<00:02:50.460> later
