00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.779
 let's pray with the purple color well 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.779
 purple in speed 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.030
 in the selector 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.890
 Viktor has 9 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.600
 with purple in speed 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.780
 this power will be called force blast forms 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.430
 it's as if you winnow the enemies with 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.900
 the force field 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.000
 it has started turn there is a character 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.150
 adjacent to a character that has 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 formulas like in this case vector earth 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.470
 soldier what strips 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 and what comes out does not come out 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.650
 project open backwards in the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.120
 character yes 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.130
 it's all going to be we're not going to 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.500
 attacking doing nothing only you are going to 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.440
 increase backwards and you'll get tired 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.040
 generation of power if you are also 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 character 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 and it happens that just like the catapult 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.430
 while 115 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.750
 1 and is on blocked terrain between 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.549
 counted a blocked terror it seems that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.210
 he threw himself backwards he's going to make a 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.330
 damage from hitting with stones equal 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.900
 that the catapult 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.400
 and also in obviously elevated terrain 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.010
 is going to be by the scales and 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.780
 but high step to the detract not down 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
 how much it did not fall is going to hurt 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.520
 if the damage is not constant, 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.550
 you can reduce together to write 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.470
 obviously we have damage well 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.070
 the next power 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.030
 purple 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.100
 in the table 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.100
 we have this character here 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 stereo has 9 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.149
 9 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.520
 of attack with purple well what do you want 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.570
 tell 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:18.340
 this character has clouds 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:23.000
 smoke close here we have the touches the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.660
 landmarks of 191 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.790
 well there are ones that have the green edge 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.480
 to indicate that it is general terrain 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.000
 hampered ground if it is not blocked 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.090
 nothing else is hindered then as 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 it gets good just like the barrier 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 to six away because he has 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.310
 ranges of 6 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 you are going to put the first marker 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.300
 6 points put it here and the rest 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.170
 adjacent 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.840
 to the markers if they have to be 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 all adjacent to each other and not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.430
 worth to stay so no 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.109
 adjacent 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.109
 within the range of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 You can also put it on the bottom of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.409
 time is increase do it and can 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.170
 stay down the enemy friend character 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.970
 yes 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.430
 it is the event the name of one while 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.890
 the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.700
 in the explosion of one can not go 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.700
 above stop us 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.100
 obviously you have to finish division 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.960
 some picture of one and the others 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.910
 assistants does not matter that the others 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.910
 lose division line does not matter 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.710
 because they are stone blockers but 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.710
 you can put 9 of 1 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.110
 so it's used and this rhythm giner and 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.090
 hindered like the green terrain 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.270
 if someone walks or gets on the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.830
 same does not have to stop 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.280
 immediately and to get out of there 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.830
 you have to roll the dice and it's going to 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.430
 reduce by half its movement 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.510
 at the end of his shift 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.510
 have to remove 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.829
 is going to be obviously a power action 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.870
 it tires quickly after the cloud of smoke 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.139
 turn on turn wants to put back 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.880
 another touch protectors and damage will be done 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.600
 well the following powers 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.990
 purple 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.969
 in defense that we have now I take 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 defends with 19 and has purple 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.480
 in defence 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.330
 what do you want simulated in defense 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.610
 the atom was mobilized in turn the source 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.650
 will return a shot on the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.410
 mystery but it has a nice touch it's going 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.510
 to endeavor to make attacked shot is not 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.990
 gives 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.520
 It is successful failure but he is not going to 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.110
 hurt the power is called 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.570
 willpower if it can not 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.470
 It also makes for striving has a lot 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.410
 strength of will 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.010
 same I do not know if you remember in skills 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.380
 we saw the shield that is crossed with 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.420
 a line has a line crossing it 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.090
 that shield being habitable is a 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.460
 untamed character so it's inevitable 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.510
 invite them is just the same as the 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.730
 wilt power the character is 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.700
 and I do not tablet has willpower 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.500
 and this despite the fact that it has another color 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.139
 in defense has in this case has 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.629
 orange 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.110
 in the part for having the crossed shield 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:49.700
 will always have willpower 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.920
 it is already by default that it has the strength of 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.510
 will those who have the defense 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.370
 crusade is all that wants to be the 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.110
 cross defense that have strength of 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.010
 will equal what they have now where 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.449
 it is also willpower well the 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.020
 Whats Next 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.430
 purple in purple damage the damage here is 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.430
 so warlock has 2 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.970
 the damage and it 's purple when it started its 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.160
 movement where he restarts his turn and 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.740
 He has a character of science blue 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.410
 so that the body nothing more but little of 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.440
 pop and it's going to happen that this 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.180
 character is expert melee if 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.430
 it's called plus comeback expert 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.050
 what does this mean that instead of 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.060
 do two years and then break the defense 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.250
 of the atom is not going to do the others 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.310
 damages that have printed will be 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.160
 four damages yes 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.930
 2 for the damages and two others for 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.230
 that expert body body if you have a 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.460
 damage to three if you have three the five 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.460
 as long as they are body to body 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.550
 well you used some power then we're going to 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.800
 see the combinations does not mean that you 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.139
 you have and little people villegas you hit 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.539
 the expert per woman but this is a 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.099
 action of power yes and person and that 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.020
 explain the rest are actions of power 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:11.169
 and it can only be a power action for 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.360
 turn by character you can not combine 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.370
 then let's see the combos 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.840
 but for this case it's only when 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.300
 be detached from another character that 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.789
 start your turn and this someone adjacent 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.090
 You can beat him with an expert body 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.090
 body 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.060
 they have all the purple color 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.960
 the next color we're going to see is the 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.960
 orange color
