00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello here came another 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 Package from China is a joystick for sony 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.599
 playstation dual shock 3 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.690
 I started to open it then remembered 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.990
 still need to share with you 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.660
 parcel went a little more than a month in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 principle not long 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 relatively it happens that longer 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.510
 go here and basically i'm nothing 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.120
 hardly know about this joystick 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.590
 since I did not buy it myself, too 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 As a matter of fact, many parcels have been asked. 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.789
 in principle, such a controller came 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 the seller is responsive everything is fine to me 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.430
 explained how much I understood this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 joystick works can work without 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.770
 wires via bluetooth headset with 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.239
 computer and sony playstation you know 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.149
 what I think from the computer so that he 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.010
 worked needed some software i was looking for 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.939
 already information about this wanted him 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 just test but if that this 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.159
 we can do it later and now in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 principle 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.650
 open the package and see the joystick itself 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.650
 closer 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.970
 The kit comes with a cord and a joystick itself 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 paper is visible here you can see 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.579
 bluetooth icon 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 that is, the joystick works can work 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.180
 via bluetooth but no 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.280
 Ventura no only the joystick itself and here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.400
 battery charging cord 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.229
 battery joseki slim I'm 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 Basically, I do not really understand such 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.360
 things to look at but it is a nice no no 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.720
 scratch not crush and nothing he absolutely 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 new it seems to me joystick hands 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.729
 it sits comfortably even like this 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 wanted or something like usual 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.220
 some kind of game joystick turned on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.430
 blinking 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.710
 Well, in principle, at first glance, no 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.710
 no defects, I think that in his work 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.980
 also no defects will be found but if you 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.690
 want to see his test or something in this 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.190
 leave a comment in principle 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.640
 happy with the purchase but got me for 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.190
 15 dollars is in my opinion not so 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 expensive for such a joystick though priced 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.230
 too, I am not very versed in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.970
 this type of goods 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.420
 Well, such a joystick can be to him 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:48.000
 connect less drive and yusbi 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 computer and under and charge it or 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.200
