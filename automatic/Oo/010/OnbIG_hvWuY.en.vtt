bullet<00:02:23.710> hits<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.100> not<00:02:24.250> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.580> make

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
bullet hits it's not going to just make

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.130 
bullet hits it's not going to just make
a<00:02:24.760> perfect<00:02:25.210> circle<00:02:25.569> it's<00:02:25.660> gonna<00:02:25.810> look<00:02:25.900> kind<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
a perfect circle it's gonna look kind of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
up there that's pretty fragile it hasn't

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.370 
up there that's pretty fragile it hasn't
broken<00:02:36.910> I'm<00:02:37.120> gonna<00:02:37.270> actually<00:02:37.390> put<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.050> drop<00:02:38.350> of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
broken I'm gonna actually put a drop of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.530 
broken I'm gonna actually put a drop of
superglue<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.310> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
superglue on there you can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.190 
superglue on there you can
I<00:02:39.569> kind<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.950> help<00:02:41.129> reinforce<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
I kind of see it to help reinforce that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.750 
I kind of see it to help reinforce that
but<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.890> wanted<00:02:44.189> to<00:02:44.280> make<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.549> look<00:02:44.640> like

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
but I just wanted to make it look like

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
but I just wanted to make it look like
you<00:02:44.909> know<00:02:45.030> pretty<00:02:45.959> heavy<00:02:46.140> around<00:02:46.439> hit<00:02:46.680> through

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you know pretty heavy around hit through

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470 
you know pretty heavy around hit through
that<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.219> it<00:02:47.280> bended<00:02:47.700> sideways<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.390> they

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that and it bended sideways and they

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.720 
that and it bended sideways and they
didn't<00:02:48.750> quite<00:02:48.930> um<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.099> know<00:02:50.219> break<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.549> off

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
didn't quite um you know break it off

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
didn't quite um you know break it off
yet<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.540> thought<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.379> was<00:02:52.439> another<00:02:52.650> cool

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
yet so I thought that was another cool

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.530 
yet so I thought that was another cool
effect<00:02:53.159> just<00:02:53.250> had<00:02:53.459> some<00:02:53.670> Battle<00:02:53.939> Damage<00:02:53.969> on<00:02:54.390> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
effect just had some Battle Damage on to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.819 
effect just had some Battle Damage on to
it<00:02:54.659> little<00:02:54.810> humor<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.620> looks<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.769> little

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
it little humor to it it looks a little

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.009 
it little humor to it it looks a little
goofy<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.599> a<00:02:57.629> pretty<00:02:57.810> cool

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
goofy but I think it is a pretty cool

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.319 
goofy but I think it is a pretty cool
effect<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.590> yeah<00:02:59.129> when<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.760> drill<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.150> hole

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
effect but yeah when you drill that hole

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.199 
effect but yeah when you drill that hole
in<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:01.500> take<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.739> knife<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> cut

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
in there you take a knife and you cut

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.839 
in there you take a knife and you cut
two<00:03:04.049> ways<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:06.299> see<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.659> can<00:03:07.760> kind<00:03:08.760> of

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
two ways so you see if I can kind of

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.420 
two ways so you see if I can kind of
demonstrate<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.569> bit<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.739> when<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.250> have

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
demonstrate this a bit so when you have

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.270 
demonstrate this a bit so when you have
that<00:03:11.459> hole<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.939> there<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.659> cut<00:03:12.930> one<00:03:13.290> side<00:03:13.709> like

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
that hole in there you cut one side like

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.190 
that hole in there you cut one side like
this<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.819> then<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.239> twist<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.810> blade<00:03:16.019> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
this and then you twist the blade you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.619 
this and then you twist the blade you
cut<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.560> other<00:03:16.680> side<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.129> way<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.639> then<00:03:18.599> you

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
cut the other side this way and then you

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.140 
cut the other side this way and then you
do<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.409> know<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:20.359> two<00:03:22.129> three<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.430> four

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
do that you know one two three and four

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.929 
do that you know one two three and four
were<00:03:24.329> many<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.379> want<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.040> that's

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
were many that you want to do and that's

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.280 
were many that you want to do and that's
what<00:03:27.090> gives<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.389> you<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.750> real<00:03:27.959> rough

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
what gives it you know that real rough

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.460 
what gives it you know that real rough
look<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.540> over<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.200> think<00:03:31.349> that's

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
look like that so over I think that's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.629 
look like that so over I think that's
pretty<00:03:31.590> cool<00:03:31.859> effect<00:03:32.099> if<00:03:32.189> you<00:03:32.280> guys<00:03:32.370> want<00:03:32.609> to

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
pretty cool effect if you guys want to

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.729 
pretty cool effect if you guys want to
do<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.879> on<00:03:32.970> your<00:03:33.090> tanks<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.569> can<00:03:33.750> make<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
do that on your tanks you can make the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.009 
do that on your tanks you can make the
whole<00:03:34.919> huge<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.639> want<00:03:35.849> sometimes<00:03:36.659> if<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
whole huge if you want sometimes if you

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.110 
whole huge if you want sometimes if you
want<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.200> make<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.379> whole<00:03:37.560> even<00:03:37.799> bigger

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
want to make the whole even bigger

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.460 
want to make the whole even bigger
instead<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.239> using<00:03:39.419> like<00:03:39.569> this<00:03:39.930> kind<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.260> thing

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
instead of using like this kind of thing

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920 
instead of using like this kind of thing
I<00:03:40.909> actually<00:03:41.909> just<00:03:42.180> take<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.450> whole<00:03:42.569> tip<00:03:42.810> of

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
I actually just take the whole tip of

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.140 
I actually just take the whole tip of
the<00:03:42.989> knife<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.409> just<00:03:44.040> screw<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.879> in<00:03:44.970> there

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the knife and just screw it in there

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.390 
the knife and just screw it in there
like<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:46.949> you're<00:03:46.979> just<00:03:47.129> kind

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
like this so you know you're just kind

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.520 
like this so you know you're just kind
of<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:47.790> with<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.690> make<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> decent

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
of going in with that you make a decent

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.170 
of going in with that you make a decent
size<00:03:49.859> hole<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.430> then<00:03:50.669> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.879> go<00:03:50.940> ahead<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
size hole and then you can go ahead and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.309 
size hole and then you can go ahead and
cut<00:03:51.329> your<00:03:51.449> stars<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.109> make<00:03:52.199> it

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
cut your stars in there and make it

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.420 
cut your stars in there and make it
rugged-looking<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.010> don't<00:03:53.129> want<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.310> cut

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
rugged-looking you don't want to cut

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.360 
rugged-looking you don't want to cut
like<00:03:53.519> massive<00:03:54.829> star-shaped<00:03:55.829> cuts<00:03:56.099> in<00:03:56.250> there

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
like massive star-shaped cuts in there

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.500
