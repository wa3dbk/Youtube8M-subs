Portland cement and so and it and it's

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.180 
Portland cement and so and it and it's
an<00:00:35.450> easy<00:00:35.600> mix<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.350> make<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:36.680> let's<00:00:36.830> walk<00:00:37.010> over

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
an easy mix to make so let's walk over

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.550 
an easy mix to make so let's walk over
here<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.640> our<00:00:37.670> our<00:00:38.000> mixer<00:00:38.900> which<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.320> really<00:00:39.530> a

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
here to our our mixer which is really a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.770 
here to our our mixer which is really a
very<00:00:39.740> very<00:00:39.830> good<00:00:40.430> now<00:00:41.000> how<00:00:41.210> much<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:41.630> do

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
very very good now how much of this do

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290 
very very good now how much of this do
we<00:00:41.840> have<00:00:41.990> in<00:00:42.140> here<00:00:42.260> now<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:42.500> have<00:00:42.860> peat<00:00:43.610> perlite

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
we have in here now we have peat perlite

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.540 
we have in here now we have peat perlite
and<00:00:44.360> Portland<00:00:44.810> cement<00:00:45.080> so<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:45.410> one<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:46.010> one

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
and Portland cement so it's one to one

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.670 
and Portland cement so it's one to one
so<00:00:47.150> what<00:00:47.360> we've<00:00:47.510> done<00:00:47.540> is<00:00:47.870> filled<00:00:48.140> up<00:00:48.320> one<00:00:48.560> of

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
so what we've done is filled up one of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.470 
so what we've done is filled up one of
these<00:00:48.770> with<00:00:49.250> peat<00:00:49.700> peat

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
these with peat peat

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.350 
these with peat peat
two<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.110> them<00:00:51.200> with<00:00:51.320> perlite<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.010> then<00:00:52.760> we<00:00:52.910> do

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
two of them with perlite and then we do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.330 
two of them with perlite and then we do
one<00:00:53.390> Portland<00:00:53.930> cement<00:00:54.260> okay<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:54.770> that's<00:00:55.130> your

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
one Portland cement okay so that's your

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.190 
one Portland cement okay so that's your
formula<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.060> ones<00:00:56.240> we're<00:00:56.390> gonna<00:00:56.450> do<00:00:56.720> today<00:00:56.870> we

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
formula the ones we're gonna do today we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.130 
formula the ones we're gonna do today we
go<00:00:57.350> ahead<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:58.190> crack<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.760> open<00:00:58.990> so<00:00:59.990> what

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
go ahead and crack that open so what

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.390 
go ahead and crack that open so what
we've<00:01:00.290> done<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.590> already<00:01:00.860> mixed<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.220> dry

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
we've done is already mixed the dry

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.680 
we've done is already mixed the dry
ingredients<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:03.790> this<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:04.970> can<00:01:05.150> get<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.479> at

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
ingredients and this you can get this at

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.450 
ingredients and this you can get this at
any<00:01:05.780> hardware<00:01:06.140> store<00:01:06.380> yeah<00:01:06.830> make<00:01:07.160> sure<00:01:07.310> it's

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
any hardware store yeah make sure it's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.730 
any hardware store yeah make sure it's
Portland<00:01:07.850> cement<00:01:08.150> MS<00:01:08.330> feel<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.870> consistency

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
Portland cement MS feel the consistency

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.890 
Portland cement MS feel the consistency
is<00:01:09.860> there's<00:01:10.220> no<00:01:10.370> gravel<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.180> corn<00:01:11.570> starch

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
remember one to one one to one and then

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.950 
remember one to one one to one and then
you<00:01:31.190> can<00:01:31.220> really<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.970> easy<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.480> adjust<00:01:32.570> if

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
you can really it's easy to adjust if

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.340 
you can really it's easy to adjust if
you<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> little<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.480> so<00:01:35.480> now<00:01:35.659> some<00:01:36.320> of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
you get a little it is so now some of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.960 
you get a little it is so now some of
these<00:01:36.500> like<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:37.010> one<00:01:37.220> William<00:01:37.520> we'd<00:01:37.760> put

these like this one William we'd put
color<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:38.960> concrete<00:01:39.200> colorant<00:01:39.830> it's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
color in it it's concrete colorant it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.550 
color in it it's concrete colorant it's
in<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> powdered<00:01:41.000> form<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:42.230> buy<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.380> at

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
in the powdered form and you buy it at

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.200 
in the powdered form and you buy it at
the<00:01:42.740> hardware<00:01:43.370> store<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:43.909> concrete

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
the hardware store it's concrete

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.840 
the hardware store it's concrete
colorant<00:01:44.810> they<00:01:45.740> use<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.070> like<00:01:46.250> mortars<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
colorant they use in like mortars so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.610 
colorant they use in like mortars so
this<00:01:47.090> one<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.420> particularly<00:01:47.870> red<00:01:48.350> and
