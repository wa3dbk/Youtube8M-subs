00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:18.550
 hello little test of voice commands 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.550
 on the vault and rooms the us 7000 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:29.210
 voice commands his gadget for the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 most people but very practical in 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.569
 my heart and I think that in the heart 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.149
 ah good for everyone so here 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:48.769
 how does it work just say 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:53.839
 voice control and the menu goes off 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:57.109
 with etam source walls of the channel here is 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.789
 sources and that goes off to excuse 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:09.680
 relationships followed since from target the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:18.530
 say on this 1 or 2 or 3 so check 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:21.049
 vocal control total us in the channel 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.960
 it is to change the young chains 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.710
 sylvain presents it is to call you 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.100
 increased lower volume 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:36.289
 mute to cut the are no longer so 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:43.480
 the snap and others are also doing their 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:53.880
 back it must be canceled so 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.880
 miro channel channel number channel 17 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.980
 when you see it responds well enough 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 channel 8 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.760
 channel 2 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.129
 channel 2 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.090
 channel 1 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 come to our home 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.489
 anne v 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:41.950
 we can also zap in chains 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.950
 following channels 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:53.079
 that's it for the sound it's down the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.079
 volume increase volume 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:21.909
 and there we can be volume 11 volume 11 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:31.629
 then canceled here grosso had to 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:31.629
 cancel allowed is canceled 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:42.000
 so that works pretty well 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:46.319
 sometimes you have to repeat but in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 the whole thing reacts very quickly but 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.340
 it's still very practical when you 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.609
 did not look for the remote 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:01.609
 that's it for this little test and 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.609
 demonstrations
