type of tile to the next this is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.539 
type of tile to the next this is
actually<00:02:24.959> over<00:02:25.200> top<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> basement<00:02:26.099> back

actually over top of the basement back

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.089 
actually over top of the basement back
here<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.049> it's<00:02:28.049> an<00:02:28.110> old<00:02:28.260> building<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.769> don't

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
here and it's an old building I don't

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.259 
here and it's an old building I don't
think<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> would<00:02:29.519> be<00:02:29.610> able<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.849> handle<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
think it would be able to handle the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.380 
think it would be able to handle the
weight<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.370> bunch<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:32.670> tanks<00:02:33.000> being<00:02:33.150> put

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
weight of of a bunch of tanks being put

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.920 
weight of of a bunch of tanks being put
on<00:02:33.510> there<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> know

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
station down here but this area here is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.260 
station down here but this area here is
where<00:03:27.900> we're<00:03:28.140> going<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.500> breed<00:03:29.840> discus<00:03:30.860> angels

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
where we're going to breed discus angels

and other South American cichlids we'll

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.220 
and other South American cichlids we'll
get<00:03:35.820> into<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.150> later<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.810> probably

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
get into that later this is probably

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.610 
get into that later this is probably
going<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.530> be<00:03:37.590> something<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.360> don't<00:03:39.630> get

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
going to be something that we don't get

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.870 
going to be something that we don't get
started<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:42.020> six<00:03:43.020> seven<00:03:43.170> months<00:03:43.290> or<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.880> we've

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
started for six seven months or so we've

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.120 
started for six seven months or so we've
already<00:03:45.090> got<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.360> couple<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> fish<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:46.980> we're

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
already got a couple of fish that we're

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.860 
already got a couple of fish that we're
breeding<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.460> we<00:03:47.700> could<00:03:47.910> put<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.390> here<00:03:48.660> but

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
breeding that we could put down here but

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.460 
breeding that we could put down here but
we'll<00:03:49.080> put<00:03:49.440> them<00:03:49.500> somewhere<00:03:49.830> else<00:03:49.890> until

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
we'll put them somewhere else until

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.500 
we'll put them somewhere else until
until<00:03:52.470> we're<00:03:52.620> ready<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:54.030> know<00:03:54.060> build<00:03:54.360> this

high<00:05:57.630> with<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:59.100> probably<00:05:59.370> wouldn't

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
high with it but it probably wouldn't

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.200 
high with it but it probably wouldn't
would<00:06:01.230> work<00:06:01.440> too<00:06:01.650> well<00:06:01.830> leases<00:06:02.280> five<00:06:03.120> foot<00:06:03.360> two

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
would work too well leases five foot two

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.280 
would work too well leases five foot two
now<00:06:06.210> if<00:06:06.390> we<00:06:06.540> go<00:06:06.750> out<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.140> door

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290
