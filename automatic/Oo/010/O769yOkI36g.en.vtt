00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.780 
set your hearth let's hope but you know
I<00:04:45.590> didn't<00:04:45.800> want<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.280> ended<00:04:46.490> up<00:04:46.580> running

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
I didn't want to so I ended up running

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.790 
I didn't want to so I ended up running
backwards<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.240> forwards<00:04:47.600> another<00:04:48.560> thing<00:04:48.710> to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
backwards and forwards another thing to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.300 
backwards and forwards another thing to
note<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.550> book<00:04:49.880> respawns<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.350> if<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.950> want

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
note is the book respawns so if you want

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.950 
note is the book respawns so if you want
to<00:04:52.400> do<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:53.060> don't<00:04:53.240> need<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.690> keep

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
to do this you don't need to keep

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.240 
to do this you don't need to keep
resetting<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.440> instance<00:04:54.770> for<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.040> book

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
resetting the instance for the book

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.790 
resetting the instance for the book
which<00:04:56.060> i<00:04:56.300> guess<00:04:56.570> is<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.990> only<00:04:57.110> upside<00:04:57.650> for

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
which i guess is the only upside for

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.110 
which i guess is the only upside for
doing<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.100> book<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.400> can<00:04:58.490> keep<00:04:58.760> doing<00:04:58.940> it

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
doing the book you can keep doing it

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.280 
doing the book you can keep doing it
without<00:04:59.270> resetting<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.930> instance<00:05:00.170> which

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
without resetting the instance which

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.930 
without resetting the instance which
means<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.530> don't<00:05:00.590> have<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.860> kill<00:05:01.010> mobs<00:05:01.190> makes

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
means you don't have to kill mobs makes

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.070 
means you don't have to kill mobs makes
it<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.120> little<00:05:02.270> bit<00:05:02.390> quicker<00:05:02.510> for<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.840> can<00:05:02.960> just

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
it a little bit quicker for you can just

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.230 
it a little bit quicker for you can just
run<00:05:03.230> through<00:05:03.380> without<00:05:03.770> killing<00:05:04.400> any<00:05:04.490> mobs<00:05:04.700> but

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
run through without killing any mobs but

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.540 
run through without killing any mobs but
the<00:05:05.390> instance<00:05:05.720> is<00:05:05.840> just<00:05:06.200> just<00:05:06.950> longer<00:05:07.250> that's

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
the instance is just just longer that's

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.190 
the instance is just just longer that's
the<00:05:07.670> only<00:05:07.790> problem<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.660> I'll<00:05:08.750> show<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.020> right

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
the only problem and I'll show you right

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.410 
the only problem and I'll show you right
over<00:05:09.530> here<00:05:09.680> in<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.830> second

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
over here in a second

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.970 
over here in a second
which<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.570> what<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> find<00:05:12.200> skate<00:05:12.650> about<00:05:12.770> nine

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
which is what I find skate about nine

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.460 
which is what I find skate about nine
runs<00:05:13.280> guys<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:14.180> it's<00:05:14.390> just<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.780> revered<00:05:15.200> quest

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
runs guys so it's just the revered quest

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.140 
runs guys so it's just the revered quest
chain<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.040> nine<00:05:16.280> runs<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.880> then<00:05:17.000> you're

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
chain and the nine runs and then you're

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.520 
chain and the nine runs and then you're
going<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.360> be<00:05:17.510> exalted<00:05:17.720> it's<00:05:18.050> no<00:05:18.140> problem

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
going to be exalted it's no problem

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.940 
going to be exalted it's no problem
I<00:05:18.620> did<00:05:19.520> get<00:05:19.670> instance<00:05:20.090> locked<00:05:20.300> out<00:05:20.450> at<00:05:20.570> once

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
I did get instance locked out at once

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.830 
I did get instance locked out at once
because<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.980> was<00:05:22.040> doing<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:22.430> quick<00:05:22.720> but<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.750> was

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
on the instance locked out for about 20

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.800 
on the instance locked out for about 20
minutes<00:05:25.820> so<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.060> wasn't<00:05:26.360> what<00:05:26.480> big<00:05:26.630> deal
