00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
lay that across this piece here you'll

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100 
lay that across this piece here you'll
see<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> follow<00:02:24.330> these<00:02:24.540> lines<00:02:24.870> there's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
see you can follow these lines there's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.559 
see you can follow these lines there's
this<00:02:25.230> line<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.670> traces<00:02:27.090> along<00:02:27.209> down

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
this line here that traces along down

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.839 
this line here that traces along down
and<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.849> this<00:02:30.650> silver<00:02:31.650> piece<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
and to this silver piece here so that

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.119 
and to this silver piece here so that
use<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> as<00:02:33.269> your<00:02:33.299> border<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.890> rest

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
use that as your border and just rest

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.449 
use that as your border and just rest
that<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.680> I'd<00:02:37.860> say<00:02:38.010> try<00:02:38.069> that

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
that like that and you I'd say try that

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.800 
that like that and you I'd say try that
first<00:02:38.640> before<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:39.120> start<00:02:39.150> fiddling<00:02:39.629> with<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
first before you start fiddling with the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.759 
first before you start fiddling with the
grounding<00:02:40.110> screw<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.409> just<00:02:40.530> slide<00:02:40.739> your

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
grounding screw and just slide your

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.610 
grounding screw and just slide your
cover<00:02:41.099> back<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:42.420> idea<00:02:42.870> behind<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
cover back on and the idea behind that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
cover back on and the idea behind that
is<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.099> bad<00:02:44.549> solder<00:02:44.819> connection<00:02:45.359> in<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.629> piece

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
is a bad solder connection in this piece

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.229 
is a bad solder connection in this piece
here<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.890> cardboard<00:02:47.760> piece<00:02:47.910> applies

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
here and that cardboard piece applies

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.330 
here and that cardboard piece applies
enough<00:02:48.569> pressure<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.890> make

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
enough pressure that it's going to make

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
enough pressure that it's going to make
the<00:02:50.519> connection<00:02:50.910> again<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.709> doesn't

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the connection again but if that doesn't

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.240 
the connection again but if that doesn't
work<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.640> which<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.970> didn't<00:02:54.209> for<00:02:54.359> me

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
work for you and which it didn't for me

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.770 
work for you and which it didn't for me
get<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.370> small<00:02:56.700> screwdriver<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.329> same<00:02:57.540> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
get your small screwdriver the same that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.890 
get your small screwdriver the same that
you<00:02:58.760> same<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.909> took<00:03:00.120> your<00:03:00.329> bottom<00:03:00.659> screws

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you same a you took your bottom screws

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.289 
you same a you took your bottom screws
off<00:03:01.079> with<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.640> larger<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
off with or it's a bit larger so you

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.970 
off with or it's a bit larger so you
might<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> household<00:03:04.290> driver<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.950> a

might have a household driver like a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.970 
might have a household driver like a
pocket<00:03:05.400> screwdriver<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.650> will<00:03:07.769> fit

pocket screwdriver that that will fit

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.920 
pocket screwdriver that that will fit
that<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.030> grounding<00:03:09.450> screw<00:03:09.599> here

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that and this this grounding screw here

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.539 
that and this this grounding screw here
and<00:03:10.260> what<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.590> want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.799> do<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.159> I've

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
and what you want to do to that I've

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.339 
and what you want to do to that I've
already<00:03:11.790> done<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.750> loosen<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.200> up

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
already done it but you loosen it up

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.460 
already done it but you loosen it up
completely<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.159> phone<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.379> then<00:03:16.379> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
completely out of the phone and then you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.229 
completely out of the phone and then you
just<00:03:16.709> tighten<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.310> enough<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.970> staying

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
just tighten it enough that it's staying

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210 
just tighten it enough that it's staying
in<00:03:18.419> there<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:19.290> you're<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:19.769> applying<00:03:19.950> any

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
in there but you're not applying any

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640 
in there but you're not applying any
pressure<00:03:20.660> actually<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.840> engage<00:03:22.230> your<00:03:22.410> screw

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
pressure actually to engage your screw

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.240 
pressure actually to engage your screw
and<00:03:24.620> believe<00:03:25.620> me<00:03:25.769> I've<00:03:25.859> tried<00:03:25.919> almost

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and believe me I've tried almost

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.309 
and believe me I've tried almost
everything<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.849> that's<00:03:27.060> what<00:03:27.299> worked<00:03:27.510> I'm

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
everything and that's what worked I'm

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.050 
everything and that's what worked I'm
not<00:03:28.560> exactly<00:03:28.859> sure<00:03:29.069> why<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:29.730> something<00:03:29.910> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
not exactly sure why it's something to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.490 
not exactly sure why it's something to
do<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.389> grounding<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.169> you<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.470> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
do with the grounding but you if you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.800 
do with the grounding but you if you
find<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:31.980> when<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.849> put<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> case<00:03:33.329> back<00:03:33.540> on

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
find that when you put the case back on

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
find that when you put the case back on
the<00:03:34.169> call<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.440> no<00:03:34.560> longer<00:03:34.799> work<00:03:35.099> after<00:03:35.489> doing

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the call is no longer work after doing

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.849 
the call is no longer work after doing
that<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.120> got<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> loosen<00:03:37.379> it<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> little<00:03:37.560> bit

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
that you got it loosen it a little bit

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.199 
that you got it loosen it a little bit
more<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.430> something<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.849> do<00:03:38.970> with<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
more it's something to do with the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.990 
more it's something to do with the
grounding<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.690> phone<00:03:39.930> that's<00:03:41.000> disabling

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
grounding of the phone that's disabling

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.979 
grounding of the phone that's disabling
the<00:03:42.599> mic<00:03:42.840> during<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:44.069> call<00:03:44.419> so<00:03:45.419> it's<00:03:45.599> a<00:03:45.720> small

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the mic during a call so it's a small

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.770 
the mic during a call so it's a small
finicky<00:03:46.410> issue<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:47.329> it's<00:03:48.329> definitely<00:03:48.569> worth

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
finicky issue and it's definitely worth

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.259 
finicky issue and it's definitely worth
a<00:03:48.930> try<00:03:49.139> before<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.829> go<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.160> spend<00:03:50.879> money<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.180> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
a try before you go and spend money on a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.110 
a try before you go and spend money on a
new<00:03:51.480> phone<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.739> once<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.430> loosen<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.940> screw

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
new phone so once you loosen that screw

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.610 
new phone so once you loosen that screw
up<00:03:54.389> there<00:03:55.879> you<00:03:56.879> just<00:03:57.120> reinstall<00:03:58.109> your<00:03:58.349> back

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
up there you just reinstall your back

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.369 
up there you just reinstall your back
cover<00:03:58.859> piece<00:03:59.129> just<00:03:59.819> by<00:04:00.060> leaving<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.109> same

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
cover piece just by leaving that same

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.900 
cover piece just by leaving that same
gap<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.829> was<00:04:02.010> there<00:04:02.190> when<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.459> removed<00:04:02.790> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
gap that was there when you removed it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.390 
gap that was there when you removed it
and<00:04:03.109> kind<00:04:04.109> of<00:04:04.230> engaging<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.799> back<00:04:04.949> sliding
