00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
to want have a foot longer rail because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929 
to want have a foot longer rail because
you'll<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.840> sticking<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.560> past<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> ends<00:01:11.460> in

you'll be sticking out past the ends in
that<00:01:12.240> case<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.869> measures<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.770> distance<00:01:14.220> of

that case just measures the distance of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
that case just measures the distance of
the<00:01:14.460> wall<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.110> the

anchor will and they're rated up to 250

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.179 
anchor will and they're rated up to 250
pounds<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.599> they're<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.470> strong<00:02:40.829> much

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
pounds so they're very strong much

pounds so they're very strong much
stronger<00:02:41.489> than<00:02:41.640> people<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:43.319> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
stronger than people think and what you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.140 
stronger than people think and what you
do<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.890> case<00:02:44.189> is<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.879> drill<00:02:45.120> a

do in this case is you have to drill a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.899 
do in this case is you have to drill a
half-inch<00:02:45.659> hole<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.230> then<00:02:47.159> you<00:02:47.310> insert<00:02:47.639> this

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
half-inch hole and then you insert this

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.289 
half-inch hole and then you insert this
metal<00:02:48.299> channel<00:02:48.780> ear<00:02:49.349> flange<00:02:49.829> use<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.030> you

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
metal channel ear flange use it and you

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.839 
metal channel ear flange use it and you
have<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> plastic<00:02:51.810> zip<00:02:52.260> tie<00:02:52.470> attached<00:02:52.889> Surt

have a plastic zip tie attached Surt
through<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.329> wall<00:02:54.709> then<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.889> straighten<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
through the wall then you straighten it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.360 
through the wall then you straighten it
out<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.299> then<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.799> little<00:02:59.220> piece

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
out like this and then this little piece

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.809 
out like this and then this little piece
will<00:02:59.819> zip<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.319> wall<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.639> then<00:03:02.639> once

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
will zip up to the wall and then once

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.110 
will zip up to the wall and then once
you<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.290> firmly<00:03:04.290> there<00:03:04.709> these<00:03:05.670> tabs

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you have that firmly there these tabs

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080 
you have that firmly there these tabs
break<00:03:06.569> off<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.109> then<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:08.010> screw<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.700> bolt

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
break off and then you just screw a bolt

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:22.910 
break off and then you just screw a bolt
such<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.319> into<00:03:11.310> place

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.640 

oK<00:03:23.850> we've<00:03:24.030> determined<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.350> not

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
oK we've determined that this is not

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.730 
oK we've determined that this is not
brick<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.670> rather<00:03:26.880> brick<00:03:27.390> veneer<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.050> this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
brick but rather brick veneer and this

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.670 
brick but rather brick veneer and this
is<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> hollow<00:03:29.220> drywall<00:03:29.910> behind<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.900> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
is a hollow drywall behind here so we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.320 
is a hollow drywall behind here so we
are<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.100> using<00:03:32.340> our<00:03:32.670> zip<00:03:33.209> tie<00:03:34.280> bolts

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
are going to be using our zip tie bolts

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.949 
are going to be using our zip tie bolts
to<00:03:36.330> mount<00:03:37.020> this<00:03:37.290> railing<00:03:37.620> today<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.780> have

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to mount this railing today and I have

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.740 
to mount this railing today and I have
here<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> EZ<00:03:40.830> rail<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:41.730> pre<00:03:42.150> painted<00:03:42.420> it

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
here the EZ rail and we pre painted it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.830 
here the EZ rail and we pre painted it
for<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.709> demonstration<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:45.330> what<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:45.630> want

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
for this demonstration and what we want

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.930 
for this demonstration and what we want
to<00:03:45.930> do<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.410> we're<00:03:46.680> going<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.920> mount<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.400> so

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
to do is we're going to mount this so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.690 
to do is we're going to mount this so
that<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.240> railing<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:49.080> consistent<00:03:49.980> two

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
that the railing is a consistent two

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.000 
that the railing is a consistent two
foot<00:03:50.940> ten<00:03:51.270> above<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.020> nosing<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> treads

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
foot ten above the nosing of the treads

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.850 
foot ten above the nosing of the treads
so<00:03:53.940> at<00:03:54.239> each<00:03:54.630> place<00:03:55.020> it's<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> be<00:03:55.560> two

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
so at each place it's going to be two

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:10.369 
so at each place it's going to be two
foot<00:03:56.100> ten<00:03:56.340> above

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.619 

okay<00:04:11.379> now<00:04:11.769> we've<00:04:12.040> marked<00:04:12.730> our<00:04:12.879> two<00:04:13.060> points<00:04:13.299> off

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
okay now we've marked our two points off

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.839 
okay now we've marked our two points off
two<00:04:13.930> foot<00:04:14.140> ten<00:04:14.319> off<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.590> nosing<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.129> then<00:04:15.700> I'm

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
two foot ten off the nosing and then I'm

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.969 
two foot ten off the nosing and then I'm
just<00:04:16.000> using<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.449> snap<00:04:16.720> line<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.260> lightly<00:04:17.769> mark

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
just using a snap line to lightly mark

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.680 
just using a snap line to lightly mark
this<00:04:18.250> area<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:20.139> we<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.410> clean<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.829> off<00:04:20.949> later

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
this area so we can clean that off later

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.240 
this area so we can clean that off later
now<00:04:22.690> what<00:04:22.930> we've<00:04:23.080> done<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.380> we've<00:04:23.740> lined<00:04:24.040> up

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
now what we've done is we've lined up

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.969 
now what we've done is we've lined up
the<00:04:24.699> edge<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.389> rail<00:04:25.720> parallel<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
the edge of this rail parallel to the

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.830 
the edge of this rail parallel to the
chalk<00:04:27.250> line<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.729> we<00:04:27.850> snapped<00:04:28.150> earlier<00:04:28.630> and

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
chalk line that we snapped earlier and

to foot ten from that nosing to two foot
ten<00:06:12.620> from<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:13.550> landing<00:06:14.090> we<00:06:15.020> then<00:06:15.560> snap<00:06:16.430> the

ten from the landing we then snap the
chalk<00:06:16.910> line<00:06:17.349> held<00:06:18.349> this<00:06:18.560> railing<00:06:19.070> up<00:06:19.840> marked

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
chalk line held this railing up marked

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.300 
chalk line held this railing up marked
and<00:06:20.990> located<00:06:21.440> at<00:06:21.560> our<00:06:21.680> holes<00:06:21.919> where<00:06:22.190> those

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
and located at our holes where those

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.300 
and located at our holes where those
brackets<00:06:22.880> are<00:06:23.380> we<00:06:24.380> drilled<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.800> holes<00:06:25.070> in

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
brackets are we drilled the holes in

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.570 
brackets are we drilled the holes in
this<00:06:25.940> case<00:06:26.180> it's<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:26.479> hollow<00:06:26.720> wall<00:06:27.080> back<00:06:27.349> there

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
this case it's a hollow wall back there

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.810 
this case it's a hollow wall back there
so<00:06:28.580> we<00:06:29.030> used<00:06:29.270> our<00:06:29.449> zip<00:06:29.690> tie<00:06:29.930> anchors<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.820> then

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
so we used our zip tie anchors and then

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.170 
so we used our zip tie anchors and then
once<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.750> was<00:06:32.930> done<00:06:33.139> we<00:06:33.380> just<00:06:34.030> anchored<00:06:35.030> the

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
once that was done we just anchored the

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.089 
once that was done we just anchored the
brackets<00:06:35.630> into<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:35.990> wall<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:36.380> we're

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
brackets into the wall and we're

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:37.570 
brackets into the wall and we're
finished

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
finished

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.640 
finished
very<00:06:38.570> easy

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650
