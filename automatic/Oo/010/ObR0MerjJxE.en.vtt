00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.520 
it to $5 so he bought this bike and had
no<00:01:51.060> rear<00:01:51.299> wheel<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> engine<00:01:52.289> was<00:01:52.380> all

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
no rear wheel and the engine was all

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.880 
no rear wheel and the engine was all
rusted<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.069> seized<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.750> course<00:01:55.020> took

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
rusted and seized up and of course took

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.710 
rusted and seized up and of course took
it<00:01:56.069> back<00:01:56.219> my<00:01:56.459> friend's<00:01:56.759> father<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.569> an

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
it back my friend's father was an

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.719 
it back my friend's father was an
engineer<00:01:58.039> he's<00:01:59.039> on<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:01.310> mean<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> ain't

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
engineer he's on it and I mean I ain't

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.279 
engineer he's on it and I mean I ain't
advertised<00:02:03.239> my<00:02:03.539> mom<00:02:03.720> advertised<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
advertised my mom advertised in the

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.539 
advertised my mom advertised in the
paper<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.709> rear<00:02:04.829> wheel<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.399> brought

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
paper for a rear wheel and so we brought

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.699 
paper for a rear wheel and so we brought
all<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> parts<00:02:06.030> together<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> gun<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
all the parts together and got a gun and

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.279 
all the parts together and got a gun and
I<00:02:08.130> guess<00:02:08.819> probably<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.079> first

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
I guess probably that was the first

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
I guess probably that was the first
motorcycle<00:02:10.890> ever<00:02:10.950> rode<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.239> friend

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
motorcycle ever rode with my friend

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.050 
motorcycle ever rode with my friend
which<00:02:12.660> were<00:02:12.959> shares<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.799> $5<00:02:14.430> motorcycle

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
which were shares in it a $5 motorcycle

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.990 
which were shares in it a $5 motorcycle
was<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.599> because<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.709> almost<00:02:17.340> free<00:02:17.849> or

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
was that because it was almost free or

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.910 
was that because it was almost free or
did<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.360> want<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.750> motorcycle<00:02:18.900> having<00:02:19.590> tried

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
did you want a motorcycle having tried

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.119 
did you want a motorcycle having tried
cars<00:02:20.220> well<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> guess<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.709> was<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
cars well I guess it it was like the

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.150 
cars well I guess it it was like the
natural<00:02:23.310> progression<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.269> used<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
natural progression you know I used to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.800 
natural progression you know I used to
drive<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.370> go-cart<00:02:26.879> around<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.420> streets

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
drive this go-cart around the streets

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.190 
drive this go-cart around the streets
really<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> mean<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.690> police<00:02:30.930> were<00:02:31.079> always

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
really I mean and the police were always

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.539 
really I mean and the police were always
chasing<00:02:31.560> me<00:02:31.799> and<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.040> always<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.370> trouble

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
chasing me and I was always in trouble

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.240 
chasing me and I was always in trouble
and<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.420> guess<00:02:34.109> the<00:02:34.230> next<00:02:34.380> progression<00:02:34.590> was<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and I guess the next progression was to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.479 
and I guess the next progression was to
then<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.579> ride<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> motorcycle<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.310> from<00:02:38.310> then

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
then to ride a motorcycle and from then

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.009 
then to ride a motorcycle and from then
on<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.650> got<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:40.889> bike<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:42.019> my

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
on when we got this bike going my

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.650 
on when we got this bike going my
friends<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:43.859> new<00:02:44.040> bike<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.579> his<00:02:45.209> birthday

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
friends got a new bike for his birthday

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.590 
friends got a new bike for his birthday
and<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:47.340> father<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:48.030> mother<00:02:48.239> thought

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
and then my father and mother thought

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.180 
and then my father and mother thought
that<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.959> should<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.650> Christmas<00:02:50.010> so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that I should have one for Christmas so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
that I should have one for Christmas so
I<00:02:50.220> got<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> new<00:02:50.760> mini<00:02:51.269> bike<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.660> Christmas<00:02:52.049> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
I got a new mini bike for Christmas and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
I got a new mini bike for Christmas and
we<00:02:52.739> got<00:02:52.980> rid<00:02:53.069> of<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.609> five<00:02:53.849> dollar

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
we got rid of that all at five dollar

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.089 
we got rid of that all at five dollar
bike<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:55.290> progressed<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.829> there<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
then once I got this new minibike I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.839 
then once I got this new minibike I
started<00:02:57.930> riding<00:02:58.200> around<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.700> fields<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
started riding around the fields and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.800
