00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
you here's mr. freeze it's definitely

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.970 
you here's mr. freeze it's definitely
not<00:00:57.820> my<00:00:58.360> choice<00:00:58.690> for<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.140> fries<00:00:59.380> design<00:00:59.770> is

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
not my choice for the fries design is

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.340 
not my choice for the fries design is
from<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.280> second<00:01:00.640> version<00:01:00.850> it'll<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:02.020> but<00:01:02.320> I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
from the second version it'll do but I

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350 
from the second version it'll do but I
definitely<00:01:02.620> prefer<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.309> first<00:01:03.550> version<00:01:03.880> so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
definitely prefer the first version so

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.570 
definitely prefer the first version so
it<00:01:04.570> is<00:01:05.110> odd<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.350> they<00:01:05.680> are<00:01:05.890> going<00:01:05.920> back<00:01:06.400> and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
it is odd that they are going back and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.219 
it is odd that they are going back and
forth<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:06.909> that<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.600> we'll<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:07.990> what<00:01:08.140> they

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
forth like that so we'll see what they

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.600 
forth like that so we'll see what they
come<00:01:08.380> out<00:01:08.530> with<00:01:08.560> after<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.250> batch<00:01:09.430> of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610
