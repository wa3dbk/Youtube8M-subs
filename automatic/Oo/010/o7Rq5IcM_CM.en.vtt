00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
end up just move it down by 1 5th string

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020 
end up just move it down by 1 5th string
culture<00:01:14.880> ok<00:01:15.619> ok<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> folks<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> the

so where it happens in this little lot

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.940 
so where it happens in this little lot
of<00:01:41.840> times<00:01:41.990> they<00:01:42.110> work<00:01:42.290> best<00:01:42.560> as<00:01:42.770> you're

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
of times they work best as you're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:02:32.710 
of times they work best as you're
transitioning<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.790> next<00:01:44.060> chord

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.980 

which<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> comfortable<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:35.990> one

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
which get kind of comfortable that I one

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.110 
which get kind of comfortable that I one
night<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.950> change<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:38.970> start

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
night on the change then you can start

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.830 
night on the change then you can start
throwing<00:02:39.450> them<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:40.050> different<00:02:40.170> places<00:02:40.470> um

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
throwing them in at different places um

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.150 
throwing them in at different places um
just<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> note<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:43.230> them<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.680> probably<00:02:43.740> want

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
just to note with them you probably want

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.830 
just to note with them you probably want
to<00:02:44.190> over<00:02:44.430> use<00:02:44.520> them<00:02:44.700> too<00:02:44.850> much<00:02:45.000> they're<00:02:45.570> great

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
to over use them too much they're great

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.550 
to over use them too much they're great
techniques<00:02:46.350> every<00:02:46.860> once<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> while<00:02:47.430> um<00:02:48.560> but

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
techniques every once in a while um but

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.810 
techniques every once in a while um but
you<00:02:49.680> probably<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.490> every

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
you probably don't to do them like every

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.120 
you probably don't to do them like every
single<00:02:51.120> time<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:52.290> using<00:02:52.470> them<00:02:52.770> like

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
single time I like using them like

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:11.309 
single time I like using them like
coming<00:02:53.460> up<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> famine<00:02:54.959> averse

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.229 

build<00:03:12.319> some<00:03:12.590> kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.830> excitement<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.670> kind

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
build some kind of excitement and kind

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.930

of times when i first started trying to
use<00:03:49.640> them<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.510> takes<00:03:50.629> a<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:50.810> bit<00:03:50.959> of

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
use them so it takes a little bit of

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.920 
use them so it takes a little bit of
time<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.379> be<00:03:51.680> able<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.459> get<00:03:53.299> right<00:03:53.480> back<00:03:53.660> into

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
time to be able to get right back into

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.599 
time to be able to get right back into
your<00:03:54.170> regular<00:03:54.349> stroke<00:03:54.890> again<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:58.340> anyway

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
your regular stroke again but anyway

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.430
