now<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.769> poster<00:00:29.220> moonbeam<00:00:29.730> who<00:00:29.939> said<00:00:30.150> the

now it was poster moonbeam who said the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
now it was poster moonbeam who said the
only<00:00:30.390> math<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> win<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> gambling<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
only math you need to win a gambling you

only math you need to win a gambling you
can<00:00:32.640> figure<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.090> eighth<00:00:33.239> grade<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
can figure out by eighth grade and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
can figure out by eighth grade and
that's<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.380> too<00:00:34.649> far<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> truth<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that's not too far from the truth if you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
that's not too far from the truth if you
can<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.090> algebra<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> figure<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.350> lot

can do algebra you can figure out a lot
of<00:00:37.680> things<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> we're<00:00:39.149> gonna<00:00:39.239> use<00:00:39.450> algebra<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
of things and we're gonna use algebra to

solve some of these problems here to
warm<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.750> gonna<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
warm up we're gonna look at the

break-even percentage just on a flatbed
now<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:47.399> you're<00:00:47.520> figuring<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
now when you're figuring out the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.150 
now when you're figuring out the
break-even<00:00:48.629> percentage<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> come

and<00:03:48.880> you'll<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.359> breakeven

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
and you'll see that the breakeven

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.319

percents on bed on lines three teamers
is<00:03:52.930> 50%<00:03:54.389> so<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.480> look<00:03:55.630> at<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.900> parlay

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
is 50% so you look at that parlay

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.710 
is 50% so you look at that parlay
possibility<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.730> break-even<00:03:58.060> percentage<00:03:58.630> on

possibility the break-even percentage on

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.509 
possibility the break-even percentage on
this<00:03:58.870> play<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.349> actually<00:03:59.739> less<00:04:00.040> than<00:04:00.069> doing<00:04:00.430> a

this play is actually less than doing a

this play is actually less than doing a
straight<00:04:00.760> bet<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.510> house<00:04:01.690> edge<00:04:01.930> there's

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
straight bet so the house edge there's

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.710 
straight bet so the house edge there's
no<00:04:02.769> house<00:04:03.010> edge<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.549> there's<00:04:04.299> a<00:04:04.359> real
