00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 personally rubens so that it is not the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.810
 repetitive speech what is said each 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.760
 tournament like you as footballers 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.300
 give a new face to what is coming and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.259
 as it does not fall into the routine so to speak 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.969
 working I think that work 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 humility the sacrifice he has had 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 always this group makes us leave 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 forward to get more titles of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.099
 keep growing as a team and good 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 let's fight for everything that comes 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.199
 because the titles by logic never 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.870
 you're going to satiate as a player not assured 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.300
 will always occupy 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.820
 for a player to win title and most 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.440
 important come with reason three 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 tournaments for us important if 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.690
 we want to win it we want 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.210
 compete and always give the best so 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.129
 I hope God wants everything to go very well and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.960
 Personally, it is the love of the people 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.120
 you already won dates the team to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.070
 shoulder they see you never want you to go 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.949
 what do you say to all those people or 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.760
 thank you for the support I've had 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.489
 obviously when I arrived it was very 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.430
 criticized but good I said it is 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.860
 issue of slaughter work and 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.030
 humility in a caste has turned 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.679
 those criticisms for applause for 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.899
 acknowledgments and well let's hope to continue 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.420
 in a way to really thank the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.340
 people the love that you gave me in 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.100
 in recent times what has been the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.659
 key to throw the equipment on your shoulder 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.300
 everything always ask for the ball I think 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.450
 I'm a player who do not like losing 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.700
 nothing 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 good when it's the team has lost 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.360
 always try to ask her to do 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.180
 play in classmates 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.340
 to be able to tie or win the game at 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.160
 same as the companions but sometimes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.650
 the desire makes one stand out a 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.330
 little more than the last rubens with nacho 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.710
 you see a lot talking, it seems that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.600
 brings you to you by the people of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 experience seems that it could be 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.270
 even to the captain or why not if 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.250
 let's wait for nacho's decision 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.660
 peer directive because to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 Sometimes the partners are the ones who say 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.240
 the captains also if we have spoken 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.540
 with the topic d h came 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.910
 what is the team trying to do that is a lot 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.180
 humility and work greatly help 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.550
 the kids who have gone up trying to 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.720
 feel comfortable and experienced 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.950
 continue to grow as a footballer and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.569
 bring the best for the team 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.010
 now that you see nacho is with the 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.349
 president is also more successes and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.349
 titles in america hope you 're 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.620
 a technician that has been crossed out by air 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.140
 defensive but for me it is not it is a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.299
 worker technician for what little he has 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.970
 talked to him comes very excited about 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.099
 to be able to get titles with the america 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.590

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.879
 keep getting titles so 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.750

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.030
 make us continue to grow as 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 footballer and team that we follow 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.019

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.610

 doing the preseason with america 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.480
