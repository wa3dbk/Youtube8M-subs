what's<00:01:51.710> around<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> lot<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.549> times<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
what's around and a lot of times in the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.490 
what's around and a lot of times in the
brackish<00:01:53.450> water<00:01:53.689> you've<00:01:53.900> got<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.080> lot<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.350> bait

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
brackish water you've got a lot of bait

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.289 
brackish water you've got a lot of bait
fish<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:55.189> lot<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.520> mullet<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:55.939> things<00:01:56.150> like

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
fish a lot of mullet and things like

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.969 
fish a lot of mullet and things like
that<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.689> they'll<00:01:56.869> come<00:01:57.020> up<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.259> eat<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.650> so

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
that that they'll come up and eat and so

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.429 
that that they'll come up and eat and so
patterns<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.430> will<00:01:58.549> imitate<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.439> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
patterns that will imitate that the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.600 
patterns that will imitate that the
other<00:02:00.619> way<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:01.009> I've<00:02:01.130> caught<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> lot<00:02:01.579> of

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
other way that I've caught a lot of

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.910 
other way that I've caught a lot of
tarpon<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.270> one<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.079> my<00:02:03.140> favorite<00:02:03.470> ways<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.799> on

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
tarpon and one of my favorite ways is on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.190 
tarpon and one of my favorite ways is on
a<00:02:03.950> fly<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.390> just<00:02:05.630> show<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.930> little

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
a fly and then just show you a little

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.859 
a fly and then just show you a little
bit<00:02:06.350> about<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.280> fly<00:02:07.549> box<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:08.569> can<00:02:08.690> see<00:02:08.840> a

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
bit about this fly box you can see a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.270 
bit about this fly box you can see a
whole<00:02:09.080> bunch<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.349> different<00:02:09.470> patterns<00:02:10.039> from

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
whole bunch of different patterns from

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.870 
whole bunch of different patterns from
poppers<00:02:10.880> -<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.380> know<00:02:12.440> baitfish<00:02:12.739> patter<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
poppers - you know baitfish patter and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.970 
poppers - you know baitfish patter and
but<00:02:14.880> tarpon<00:02:15.390> patterns<00:02:16.260> generally<00:02:16.800> take<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
but tarpon patterns generally take a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.760 
but tarpon patterns generally take a
certain<00:02:17.400> shape<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> I'll<00:02:19.140> show<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.500> couple

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
certain shape and I'll show you a couple

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.850 
certain shape and I'll show you a couple
of<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.190> they're<00:02:21.150> tied<00:02:21.660> generally<00:02:22.320> sparsely

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
of them they're tied generally sparsely

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.630 
of them they're tied generally sparsely
on<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> fly<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.900> they're<00:02:24.900> tied<00:02:25.140> back<00:02:25.640> further

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
on a fly and they're tied back further

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240 
on a fly and they're tied back further
back<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> hook<00:02:27.690> shank<00:02:27.960> then<00:02:28.620> let's<00:02:29.040> say

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
back on the hook shank then let's say

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.820 
back on the hook shank then let's say
just<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.970> regular<00:02:30.300> baitfish<00:02:30.570> fly<00:02:31.080> not

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
just a regular baitfish fly not

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
just a regular baitfish fly not
necessarily<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.670> saying<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.030> can't

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
necessarily not in saying that you can't

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.240 
necessarily not in saying that you can't
use<00:02:33.570> one<00:02:33.810> I'm<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.110> saying<00:02:34.320> like<00:02:34.590> tied<00:02:35.040> like

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
use one I'm just saying like tied like

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.520 
use one I'm just saying like tied like
this<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:36.390> generally<00:02:36.630> they're<00:02:37.050> tied<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.260> in

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
this but generally they're tied up in

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.080 
this but generally they're tied up in
this<00:02:37.680> pattern<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.610> reason<00:02:38.880> why<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this pattern and the reason why is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.190 
this pattern and the reason why is
because<00:02:39.210> they're<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.840> know<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
because they're you know it's the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200 
because they're you know it's the
weighting<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> fly<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.490> how<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.940> fly

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
weighting of the fly and and how the fly

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.640 
weighting of the fly and and how the fly
looks<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> water

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
looks in the water

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
looks in the water
this<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> last<00:02:44.610> fly<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> actually<00:02:45.330> caught<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this is the last fly I actually caught a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.110 
this is the last fly I actually caught a
tarpon<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:47.250> tied<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.850> pattern

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
tarpon on and it's tied in that pattern

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.820 
tarpon on and it's tied in that pattern
you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.290> there's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.560> lot<00:02:49.710> of

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
you can see that there's a lot of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.150 
you can see that there's a lot of
different<00:02:50.250> patterns<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.880> come<00:02:51.150> in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
different patterns that they come in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.530 
different patterns that they come in
depending<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.280> what's<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.880> water<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
depending on what's in the water and the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.110 
depending on what's in the water and the
situation<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.590> they're<00:02:55.740> keying<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.640> lot

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
situation what they're keying on a lot

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.610 
situation what they're keying on a lot
of<00:02:57.210> times<00:02:57.390> these<00:02:57.720> patterns<00:02:58.050> are<00:02:58.170> imitating

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
of times these patterns are imitating

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.310 
of times these patterns are imitating
shrimp<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.950> anything<00:03:02.370> else<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.760> about

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
shrimp but like anything else it's about

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.780 
shrimp but like anything else it's about
your<00:03:04.320> delivery<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.040> presentation<00:03:05.670> so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
your delivery and presentation so

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.280 
your delivery and presentation so
depending<00:03:06.180> upon<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.780> conditions<00:03:07.230> that

depending upon the conditions that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.140 
depending upon the conditions that
you're<00:03:07.440> fishing<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.370> delivery<00:03:08.790> might<00:03:09.000> be

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
you're fishing in the delivery might be

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.960 
you're fishing in the delivery might be
better<00:03:09.330> with<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.660> jig<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.380> jig<00:03:11.280> head<00:03:11.460> with<00:03:11.730> bait

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
better with a jig a jig head with bait

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.180 
better with a jig a jig head with bait
might<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.750> better<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> fly<00:03:13.380> might<00:03:14.100> be

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
might be better with a fly might be

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.500 
might be better with a fly might be
better<00:03:14.340> trolling<00:03:14.760> around<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.090> you're<00:03:15.180> looking

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
