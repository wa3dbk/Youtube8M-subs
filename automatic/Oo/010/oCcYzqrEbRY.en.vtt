for the guide was me doing it in bought
gear<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.910> make<00:00:38.060> it<00:00:38.180> more<00:00:38.300> relatable<00:00:38.750> for

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
gear to make it more relatable for

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.310 
gear to make it more relatable for
people<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:39.740> low<00:00:39.980> lavake<00:00:40.220> who<00:00:40.790> don't<00:00:41.120> have

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
people with low lavake who don't have

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.960 
people with low lavake who don't have
overloads<00:00:42.320> who<00:00:42.890> don't<00:00:43.100> have<00:00:43.280> turmoil<00:00:43.820> and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
overloads who don't have turmoil and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.380 
overloads who don't have turmoil and
still<00:00:44.720> get<00:00:44.900> it<00:00:45.050> done<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.130> you<00:00:46.850> probably<00:00:46.880> notice

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
still get it done so you probably notice

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.730 
still get it done so you probably notice
that<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.600> do<00:00:47.660> have<00:00:47.960> one<00:00:47.990> what<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.440> have

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
that I do have one what I do have

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.100 
that I do have one what I do have
turmoil<00:00:49.190> here<00:00:49.970> but<00:00:50.540> I'm<00:00:50.810> going<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.020> address

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
turmoil here but I'm going to address

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.950 
turmoil here but I'm going to address
that<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.560> proper<00:00:52.550> way<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.790> do<00:00:53.390> virago

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
that the proper way to do virago

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.590 
that the proper way to do virago
efficiently<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.920> not<00:00:55.310> to<00:00:55.580> mail<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:55.970> mail<00:00:56.150> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
efficiently is not to mail it mail a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.930 
efficiently is not to mail it mail a
since<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.500> EOC<00:00:57.830> has<00:00:58.130> not<00:00:58.340> been<00:00:58.550> good<00:00:58.730> because

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
since the EOC has not been good because

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.070 
since the EOC has not been good because
all<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.440> other<00:01:00.470> climate<00:01:01.130> cells<00:01:01.400> are<00:01:02.080> around

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
all the other climate cells are around

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.499 
all the other climate cells are around
the<00:01:03.290> same<00:01:03.320> damage<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.479> downside<00:01:05.479> of

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
the same damage and the downside of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.660 
the same damage and the downside of
being<00:01:05.719> male<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.409> distance<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.070> Mellie<00:01:07.399> is

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
being male a distance with Mellie is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.889 
being male a distance with Mellie is
that<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.979> get<00:01:10.130> hit<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.000> lose<00:01:11.299> screwed<00:01:11.659> for

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
that you get hit you lose screwed for

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.630 
that you get hit you lose screwed for
that<00:01:12.109> and<00:01:12.350> that's<00:01:12.649> why<00:01:12.859> you<00:01:12.920> don't<00:01:13.219> do<00:01:13.429> it<00:01:13.549> a

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that and that's why you don't do it a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
that and that's why you don't do it a
Virago<00:01:13.939> because<00:01:14.329> if<00:01:14.539> your<00:01:14.840> mailing<00:01:15.170> distance

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
Virago because if your mailing distance

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.399 
Virago because if your mailing distance
it<00:01:15.710> does<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.979> cleve<00:01:16.189> attacks<00:01:16.490> hits<00:01:16.729> everybody

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
it does the cleve attacks hits everybody

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.800 
it does the cleve attacks hits everybody
around<00:01:18.409> him<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.340> if<00:01:19.969> we're<00:01:20.149> making<00:01:20.539> you're

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
around him and if we're making you're

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.779 
around him and if we're making you're
far<00:01:21.049> enough<00:01:21.259> away<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.649> not<00:01:21.950> get<00:01:22.159> hit<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.490> only

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
far enough away to not get hit and only

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.730 
far enough away to not get hit and only
one<00:01:22.969> person<00:01:22.999> has<00:01:23.359> to<00:01:23.450> get<00:01:23.600> hit<00:01:23.990> by<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.170> matrix

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
one person has to get hit by the matrix

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.219 
one person has to get hit by the matrix
so<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.070> best<00:01:25.219> way<00:01:25.399> is<00:01:25.670> either<00:01:26.030> range<00:01:26.509> or<00:01:26.840> mage

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
so the best way is either range or mage

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.319 
so the best way is either range or mage
it<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.619> especially<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.939> last<00:01:29.119> ways

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
it and especially on the last ways

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.419 
it and especially on the last ways
especially<00:01:29.569> because<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.950> last<00:01:31.159> face<00:01:31.399> he

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
especially because on the last face he

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.249 
especially because on the last face he
pushes<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.030> based<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.359> how<00:01:32.420> much<00:01:32.659> damage<00:01:32.899> he

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
pushes you based on how much damage he

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.880 
pushes you based on how much damage he
does<00:01:33.499> to<00:01:33.799> your<00:01:34.310> team<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:35.060> he's<00:01:36.049> not<00:01:36.259> mailing<00:01:36.560> if

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
does to your team if he's not mailing if

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.069 
does to your team if he's not mailing if
he's<00:01:37.130> using<00:01:37.249> mage<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:38.179> he<00:01:38.569> only<00:01:38.719> hits<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
he's using mage then he only hits a

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.559 
he's using mage then he only hits a
single<00:01:39.259> target<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.969> if<00:01:41.179> you

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
single target because I'm like if you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.719 
single target because I'm like if you
see<00:01:41.810> right<00:01:42.020> here<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.259> there's<00:01:43.219> only<00:01:43.369> one

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
see right here that there's only one

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.669 
see right here that there's only one
person<00:01:43.909> taking<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.479> mage<00:01:44.749> balls<00:01:44.990> now<00:01:45.409> they<00:01:45.619> do

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
person taking the mage balls now they do

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.309 
person taking the mage balls now they do
hurt<00:01:46.219> but<00:01:46.969> it's<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.329> lot<00:01:47.450> better<00:01:47.600> than<00:01:47.929> hitting

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
hurt but it's a lot better than hitting

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.489 
hurt but it's a lot better than hitting
every<00:01:48.649> single<00:01:48.950> person<00:01:49.569> but<00:01:50.569> so<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.380> reason

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
every single person but so the reason

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.919 
every single person but so the reason
I'm<00:01:51.799> using<00:01:51.829> overload<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.670> turmoil<00:01:53.119> here<00:01:53.659> is

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
I'm using overload and turmoil here is

that's like that array makes it so that
I<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.530> only<00:03:06.770> do<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.370> couple<00:03:07.640> hours<00:03:07.910> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I can only do it for a couple hours a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.330 
I can only do it for a couple hours a
day<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.660> for<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.140> most<00:03:09.260> part<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.709> first<00:03:10.100> hour

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
day and for the most part the first hour

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.430 
day and for the most part the first hour
was<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:11.270> getting<00:03:11.570> back<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.990> groove<00:03:12.170> of

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
was just getting back in the groove of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.650 
was just getting back in the groove of
things<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.310> then<00:03:13.459> second<00:03:14.030> kill<00:03:14.209> would<00:03:14.540> be

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
things and then second kill would be

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.960 
things and then second kill would be
like<00:03:14.959> okay<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.830> messed<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
like okay we messed up on that and that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.729 
like okay we messed up on that and that
pretty<00:03:17.360> much<00:03:17.480> we<00:03:17.810> would<00:03:17.959> waste<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.470> two

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
pretty much we would waste like two

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.850 
pretty much we would waste like two
hours<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.940> just<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.570> make<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.720> easier<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.650> that

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
hours so just to make it easier so that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.470 
hours so just to make it easier so that
we<00:03:21.950> could<00:03:22.070> just<00:03:22.220> get<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> kill<00:03:22.790> done<00:03:23.060> like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
we could just get the kill done like

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.830 
we could just get the kill done like
it's<00:03:23.750> easily<00:03:24.080> doable<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:25.070> for<00:03:25.459> me<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:26.420> like

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.930 
it because there hasn't been many guides
on<00:05:21.590> virago<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.130> people<00:05:22.400> know<00:05:22.520> how<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.700> do<00:05:22.820> it

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
on virago the people know how to do it

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
like it you should easily do it with a

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.310 
like it you should easily do it with a
group<00:05:25.070> of<00:05:25.220> friends<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.760> isn't<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.630> boss<00:05:26.900> where

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
group of friends it isn't a boss where

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.680 
group of friends it isn't a boss where
you<00:05:27.500> need<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.070> highest<00:05:28.430> level<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.790> items<00:05:29.360> it

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
you need the highest level of items it

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.080 
you need the highest level of items it
helps<00:05:30.169> but<00:05:30.530> it's<00:05:30.740> not<00:05:30.980> required<00:05:31.160> like<00:05:32.140> yeah

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
helps but it's not required like yeah

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.790 
helps but it's not required like yeah
like<00:05:35.090> here<00:05:35.360> we're<00:05:35.540> using<00:05:35.720> level<00:05:36.140> 70<00:05:36.440> weapons

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
like here we're using level 70 weapons

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.670 
like here we're using level 70 weapons
but<00:05:37.310> anyway<00:05:38.240> about<00:05:38.419> that<00:05:38.870> guide<00:05:39.140> i<00:05:39.169> was<00:05:39.470> going

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
but anyway about that guide i was going

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.980 
but anyway about that guide i was going
to<00:05:39.740> do<00:05:39.919> is<00:05:40.669> it<00:05:40.880> weird<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.120> i'm<00:05:41.390> not<00:05:41.419> going<00:05:41.930> to

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
to do is it weird that i'm not going to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.050 
to do is it weird that i'm not going to
be<00:05:42.200> using<00:05:42.440> bak<00:05:43.040> gear<00:05:43.310> but<00:05:43.580> i<00:05:43.610> guess<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.940> whole

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
be using bak gear but i guess the whole

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.930 
be using bak gear but i guess the whole
point<00:05:44.300> of<00:05:44.540> me<00:05:44.840> doing<00:05:44.960> guides<00:05:45.440> was<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:46.700> show

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
point of me doing guides was to show

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.270 
point of me doing guides was to show
it's<00:05:47.240> doable<00:05:47.630> in<00:05:48.020> lower<00:05:48.290> level<00:05:48.710> gear<00:05:48.979> i<00:05:49.100> guess

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
it's doable in lower level gear i guess

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.010 
it's doable in lower level gear i guess
that<00:05:49.460> was<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.640> whole<00:05:49.880> point<00:05:50.090> of<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.419> bakur<00:05:50.780> to

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
that was the whole point of the bakur to

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.800 
that was the whole point of the bakur to
show<00:05:51.169> it's<00:05:51.320> doable<00:05:51.950> without<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:53.180> highest<00:05:53.600> of

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
show it's doable without the highest of

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.780 
show it's doable without the highest of
items<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:55.550> i<00:05:55.940> guess<00:05:56.330> i<00:05:56.450> should<00:05:56.660> be<00:05:56.750> ok<00:05:57.020> right<00:05:57.050> oh

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
items so i guess i should be ok right oh

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.360 
items so i guess i should be ok right oh
right<00:05:58.790> um<00:05:59.560> if<00:06:00.560> you<00:06:00.710> haven't<00:06:01.010> noticed<00:06:01.040> already

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
right um if you haven't noticed already

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.590 
right um if you haven't noticed already
this<00:06:01.940> was<00:06:02.150> done<00:06:02.540> on<00:06:02.780> I<00:06:03.940> don't<00:06:04.940> know<00:06:05.000> is<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.479> the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600

Dutch server the German server it it's
just<00:06:08.390> not<00:06:08.570> an<00:06:08.690> English<00:06:08.990> server<00:06:09.229> that's<00:06:09.410> all<00:06:09.620> I

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
just not an English server that's all I

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
got the kill done tomorrow I believe the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.620 
got the kill done tomorrow I believe the
guys<00:06:21.680> I'm<00:06:21.860> doing<00:06:22.130> that<00:06:22.610> I<00:06:22.640> did<00:06:22.910> this<00:06:23.150> kill<00:06:23.450> if

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
guys I'm doing that I did this kill if

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.510 
guys I'm doing that I did this kill if
we're<00:06:23.900> gonna<00:06:24.140> try<00:06:24.410> and<00:06:24.590> do<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:24.800> in<00:06:24.919> batwing

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
we're gonna try and do it in batwing

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.850 
we're gonna try and do it in batwing
which<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.690> think<00:06:27.169> should<00:06:27.229> be<00:06:27.560> a<00:06:27.590> lot<00:06:27.830> easier

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
which I think should be a lot easier

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.710 
which I think should be a lot easier
than<00:06:28.190> trying<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.580> do<00:06:28.729> it<00:06:28.760> in<00:06:28.940> this<00:06:29.300> because<00:06:29.690> for

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
than trying to do it in this because for

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.450 
than trying to do it in this because for
the<00:06:29.960> last<00:06:30.140> space<00:06:30.590> that's<00:06:31.010> which<00:06:31.280> is

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
the last space that's which is

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.620 
the last space that's which is
especially<00:06:31.850> important<00:06:32.840> on<00:06:32.960> how<00:06:33.950> you<00:06:34.880> try<00:06:35.390> not

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
especially important on how you try not

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.750 
especially important on how you try not
get<00:06:35.810> damaged<00:06:36.140> and<00:06:36.380> with<00:06:36.650> major<00:06:36.919> arranged<00:06:37.460> it

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
get damaged and with major arranged it

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.629 
get damaged and with major arranged it
does<00:06:37.910> a<00:06:37.940> whole<00:06:38.150> lot<00:06:38.330> better<00:06:38.950> hopefully

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
does a whole lot better hopefully

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.059 
does a whole lot better hopefully
I<00:06:40.729> think<00:06:41.270> I'll<00:06:41.389> go<00:06:41.569> well<00:06:41.830> although<00:06:42.830> we're

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
I think I'll go well although we're

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.390 
I think I'll go well although we're
using<00:06:43.249> I<00:06:43.669> think<00:06:44.090> batwing<00:06:44.719> one<00:06:45.259> or<00:06:45.620> bat<00:06:45.860> one<00:06:46.099> I

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
using I think batwing one or bat one I

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.189 
using I think batwing one or bat one I
think<00:06:47.060> it's<00:06:47.180> called<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:47.569> that's<00:06:47.960> a<00:06:48.050> long

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
think it's called and that's a long

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.050 
think it's called and that's a long
we'll<00:06:48.349> 50<00:06:48.530> equipment<00:06:49.189> whereas<00:06:49.580> here<00:06:49.909> we're

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
we'll 50 equipment whereas here we're

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.230 
we'll 50 equipment whereas here we're
using<00:06:50.240> level<00:06:50.629> 70<00:06:50.960> so<00:06:51.229> we'll<00:06:51.439> see<00:06:51.860> how<00:06:51.889> it<00:06:52.069> goes

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
using level 70 so we'll see how it goes

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.179 
using level 70 so we'll see how it goes
actually<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.270> think<00:06:53.449> this<00:06:53.749> is<00:06:53.990> one<00:06:54.319> of<00:06:54.349> the<00:06:54.560> few

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:55.189 
actually I think this is one of the few

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.300 
actually I think this is one of the few
PBM<00:06:55.969> challenges<00:06:56.509> I've<00:06:56.749> done<00:06:57.080> in<00:06:57.319> a<00:06:57.439> long<00:06:57.469> while

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
PBM challenges I've done in a long while

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.149 
PBM challenges I've done in a long while
I<00:06:59.020> think<00:07:00.020> the<00:07:00.110> last<00:07:00.259> one<00:07:00.379> was<00:07:00.469> like<00:07:00.740> Catholic

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
I think the last one was like Catholic

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.860 
I think the last one was like Catholic
King<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.610> that<00:07:01.789> was<00:07:01.909> quite<00:07:02.060> a<00:07:02.120> while<00:07:02.210> ago<00:07:02.389> I

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
King and that was quite a while ago I

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.469 
King and that was quite a while ago I
guess<00:07:03.229> that's<00:07:03.469> like<00:07:03.740> there<00:07:04.150> isn't<00:07:05.150> much

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
guess that's like there isn't much

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.300 
guess that's like there isn't much
things<00:07:05.870> that<00:07:06.139> haven't<00:07:06.439> already<00:07:06.650> been<00:07:06.979> done

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
things that haven't already been done

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.820 
things that haven't already been done
but<00:07:07.639> I<00:07:07.849> guess<00:07:07.879> with<00:07:08.569> virago<00:07:08.900> there's<00:07:09.409> a<00:07:09.499> lot

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
but I guess with virago there's a lot
