00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
this styrofoam out of the box this is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.660 
this styrofoam out of the box this is
always<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.290> pain<00:02:07.560> everyone<00:02:08.009> hates<00:02:08.220> doing<00:02:08.520> this

that's pretty much what
I'd<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.829> while<00:02:13.010> shipping<00:02:13.400> now<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.030> was<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
I'd like while shipping now it was a

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.280 
I'd like while shipping now it was a
little<00:02:14.510> bit<00:02:14.629> of<00:02:14.719> trouble<00:02:14.870> getting<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
little bit of trouble getting the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.379 
little bit of trouble getting the
