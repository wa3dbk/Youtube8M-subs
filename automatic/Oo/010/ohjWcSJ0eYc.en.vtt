00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.070
 the 900 site 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.310
 the characteristic decides it yields this that in many years 16 editions 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
 because 2 we skipped for transfer reasons 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.040

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.160
 many musicians outside musicology composers are there between then the 16 years yes 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.560

 exhaustive but not if the first great information about music has been exhausted e 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.270

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.570
 always a room on Wednesday where 900 actually enters into history because it is 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.030
