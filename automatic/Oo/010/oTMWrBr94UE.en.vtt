00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 yes spring market for 1000 here with the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.730
 final perfection and I know the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.220
 wild guess is I think I hadn't taken it 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.900
 but I can always hope if they are the 2000 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 but i would channel this video so then 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.769
 I do not share my market but this is happy 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 the team that we used last time 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 we won playing the goudenkut measurement 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 fantastic if you haven't seen your video 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 sure then but i specially you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 10 new experienced to see a team 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.960
 not many of you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 as will be for great player 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 understand super fun team of the season 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.539
 luuk de jong is of course the iris 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 isabelle amÃ© we have built he knows 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 of course perfect I send it with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 lucia narsingh still try one anyway 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.200
 huibert out of it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.629
 it probably doesn't work well there 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.640
 the teams that made the fairly interesting out 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.719
 I am curious how it will play yes 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 you will experience it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.440
 So I'm going to play the game and it lasts 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.969
 who half us anyway flame that fat 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 sir john months ago pointed to five 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.870
 matches only gets arrow and more 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.100
 like last blinkx tent with stranger 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.059
 making a choice is a man if you want to know 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.770
 what it is 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.149
 you can also see it on twitter but if 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 what many do not understand in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.510
 People had a lot of trouble 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 people used to be what is this and then me 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 sokovia for them, they are so so 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.519
 if you want whole video about it where i am 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.540
 explanation advice is how that will work 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.909
 then let them know in a response 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 throws you online tomorrow but this team 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 as I am full of surprises 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 Nucleon really is a killer of the striker 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 Central Park rose, people worked perfectly 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.750
 for him 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 Narsingh was more than full playing 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.710
 only in the us say had a whole 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 good rib fairly strong cross and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 see his shot finished 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.080
 He really scored a really dirty grains 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 not normal 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 I can give myself x on facebook that not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
 use your concerts window woods ring 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 throw instead of pique you can 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.869
 boating and needed as a combination you have to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.369
 you have plenty of options 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.780
 fransje of that attempt was a nice thing 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 never really ramon's for him 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.890
 a large and I don't know my you just you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.450
 can you use the night was his 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 combination with games that are faster 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.790
 then the one I used but this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.899
 it was this series that should dislodge 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.430
 say something about it because it was 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 very fun to do 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.759
 i say i never have anything perfect 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 done this way and that and set up 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.299
 to see i never thought this was very bad 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.829
 would catch on because I never really do 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.210
 something with pekton live and so on this is it 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.770
 already interesting to see I'm there 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.719
 I've got the previous one slightly better 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.160
 has become live commentary because of this 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.420
 say but you don't do packs live anyway 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.920
 again you practice a little more with a you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 actions and so weeks how can you practice 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.939
 With the responses you know you have more 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.469
 so you have to excite and you become 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.439
 looked better at that, so thank you 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:21.659
 before that but this game was special 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.829
 like sx was more like live during this 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.420
 watch stream you know of course 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.609

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.709

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.470
 every position you use fucking 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.700
 dared to use alexander badly behind 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.889
 toni duckweed 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.950
 Luuk the young holy shit and this is the goal 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.120

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.069

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.019
 burdening boys in a couple 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.629
