00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
the sound better for some situations so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.030 
the sound better for some situations so

test it out if you get it it's a nice

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.280 
test it out if you get it it's a nice
little<00:02:48.370> extra<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.510> don't<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.989> too<00:02:50.170> much

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
use for it myself but anyways there was

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.870 
use for it myself but anyways there was
a<00:02:52.570> sound<00:02:52.840> test<00:02:53.080> jam<00:02:53.500> box<00:02:53.880> definitely

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
a sound test jam box definitely

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
little bigger it's more like cumbersome

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.990 
little bigger it's more like cumbersome
to<00:02:59.019> carry<00:02:59.260> around<00:02:59.440> but<00:02:59.860> 400<00:03:00.340> bucks<00:03:00.430> more<00:03:00.700> -<00:03:00.910> all

to carry around but 400 bucks more - all
worth<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> sound<00:03:01.840> quality<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.519> see

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
worth it for the sound quality so see

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.760 
worth it for the sound quality so see
