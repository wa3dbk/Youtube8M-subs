least<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> motherboard<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:11.370> is

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
least we get the motherboard this is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.570 
least we get the motherboard this is
very<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.360> small<00:02:12.990> board<00:02:13.350> there<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.040> room<00:02:14.370> if

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
very very small board there is room if

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.430 
very very small board there is room if
you<00:02:14.670> want<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> stick<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.480> single<00:02:15.870> video<00:02:16.020> card

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you want to stick in a single video card

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
you want to stick in a single video card
to<00:02:16.650> stick<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.430> off<00:02:17.610> see<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to stick in here but it all off see the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.250 
to stick in here but it all off see the
kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.210> enclose<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.570> you're<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.080> get

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
might not allow it beyond that very very

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.160 
might not allow it beyond that very very
small<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.730> board<00:02:24.000> actually<00:02:24.270> takes<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.960> 4

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
small this board actually takes it to 4

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.140 
small this board actually takes it to 4
gigabytes<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.740> memory<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.120> a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
gigabytes of memory so it's just like a
