lighter<00:01:54.659> than<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.049> looks<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> palette

kind<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:43.080> crease<00:02:43.380> while<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> very<00:02:44.850> nice

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
have to wear a base under them because

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.820 
have to wear a base under them because
they're<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:51.390> pigmentation<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.410> good<00:02:52.620> for

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
they're not the pigmentation is good for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.950 
they're not the pigmentation is good for
me<00:02:52.980> because<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.490> don't<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.210> be<00:02:54.360> too

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
me because I don't like it to be too

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.560 
me because I don't like it to be too
heavy<00:02:55.290> looking<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.490> at<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> very<00:02:57.300> natural

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
heavy looking so at for a very natural

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.750 
heavy looking so at for a very natural
look<00:02:58.020> these<00:02:58.200> are<00:02:58.260> perfect<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
look these are perfect but you can

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760 
look these are perfect but you can
definitely<00:03:00.030> build<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.810> colors<00:03:01.110> up<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.680> a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
definitely build the colors up to look a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.040 
definitely build the colors up to look a
little<00:03:01.920> bit<00:03:02.190> more<00:03:02.370> pigmented<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.240> especially

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
little bit more pigmented and especially

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.930 
little bit more pigmented and especially
wearing<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.740> base<00:03:04.920> under<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.790> really

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
wearing a base under I don't really

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.790 
wearing a base under I don't really
think<00:03:06.150> you'll<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> problem<00:03:06.600> with<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.080> and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
think you'll have a problem with it and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680 
think you'll have a problem with it and
they<00:03:07.920> feel<00:03:08.130> very<00:03:08.610> nice<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.570> it's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
they feel very nice on I think it's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.570 
they feel very nice on I think it's
because<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.320> argan<00:03:10.830> oil<00:03:11.100> infused

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
because they have the argan oil infused

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.940 
because they have the argan oil infused
into<00:03:11.880> them<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.720> they're<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:12.930> very<00:03:13.500> smooth

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
into them so they're very very smooth

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.670 
into them so they're very very smooth
the<00:03:14.640> texture<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.120> them<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.600> nice<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> just

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the texture of them is nice and it just

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.430 
the texture of them is nice and it just
lays<00:03:16.980> very<00:03:17.340> nice<00:03:17.610> on<00:03:17.820> your<00:03:17.970> skin<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:19.020> I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
lays very nice on your skin so I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.830 
lays very nice on your skin so I
definitely<00:03:20.010> highly<00:03:20.610> recommend<00:03:21.240> this<00:03:21.330> palette

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
start using her products and I've

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580 
start using her products and I've
definitely<00:03:41.520> been<00:03:41.940> enjoying<00:03:42.330> wearing<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.959> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
definitely been enjoying wearing it and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.260 
definitely been enjoying wearing it and
i'll<00:03:43.770> probably<00:03:44.070> continue<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.910> wear<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.090> for<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
i'll probably continue to wear it for a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.840 
i'll probably continue to wear it for a
while<00:03:45.480> unless<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.410> different<00:03:47.220> peel<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.610> comes

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
while unless a different peel it comes

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.000 
while unless a different peel it comes
out<00:03:48.060> i<00:03:48.420> will<00:03:48.660> probably<00:03:49.290> try<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> different<00:03:49.890> line

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
out i will probably try a different line

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.120 
out i will probably try a different line
just<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.400> get<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:51.000> better<00:03:51.810> color<00:03:52.290> variety

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
just to get a better color variety

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.820 
just to get a better color variety
because<00:03:53.370> there's<00:03:53.750> no<00:03:54.750> Purple's<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.380> here

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
because there's no Purple's in here

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.300 
because there's no Purple's in here
nothing<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.640> no<00:03:57.600> gray<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.020> no<00:03:58.440> black<00:03:58.740> so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
nothing like that no gray is no black so

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.310 
nothing like that no gray is no black so
I<00:03:59.610> really<00:04:00.090> wouldn't<00:04:00.300> mind<00:04:00.420> another<00:04:00.660> palette

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
I really wouldn't mind another palette

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320 
I really wouldn't mind another palette
with<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> little<00:04:01.770> bit<00:04:01.890> more<00:04:02.100> variety<00:04:02.300> but<00:04:03.300> I

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
with a little bit more variety but I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.140 
with a little bit more variety but I
think<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.290> kind<00:04:04.770> of<00:04:04.890> aimed<00:04:05.190> as<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.520> spring

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
think this was kind of aimed as a spring

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.090 
think this was kind of aimed as a spring
palette<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> spring<00:04:07.530> palette<00:04:07.980> it's

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
palette so for a spring palette it's

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.010 
palette so for a spring palette it's
definitely<00:04:08.610> perfect<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.360> greens<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
definitely perfect the greens and the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.680 
definitely perfect the greens and the
Browns<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.890> little<00:04:11.670> light<00:04:12.030> light

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
Browns and the little light light

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.580 
Browns and the little light light
shimmery<00:04:13.290> colors<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.490> um<00:04:14.970> i<00:04:15.900> would<00:04:16.290> definitely

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
shimmery colors so um i would definitely

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.910 
shimmery colors so um i would definitely
recommend<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.420> was<00:04:18.630> $42<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.830> you

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
recommend this and this was $42 but you

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.190 
recommend this and this was $42 but you
do<00:04:20.070> get<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.250> lot<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.489> shadows<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.330> on<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
do get a lot of shadows in it on the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.960 
do get a lot of shadows in it on the
only<00:04:22.500> thing<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.830> i<00:04:23.010> probably<00:04:23.340> won't<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.820> using

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
only thing is i probably won't be using

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.570 
only thing is i probably won't be using
all<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.330> them<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.860> sense<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.430> was<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
all of them so in that sense it was a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.180 
all of them so in that sense it was a
little

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
little

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.550 
little
on<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> pricey<00:04:27.670> side<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.450> for<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.320> quality

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
on the pricey side but for the quality

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.770 
on the pricey side but for the quality
is<00:04:29.980> very<00:04:30.130> nice<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> nice<00:04:31.540> natural
