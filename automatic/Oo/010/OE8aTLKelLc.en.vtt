 we 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 Bruno because luciano was the guy who 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.359
 transformed the language of narration 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.720
 brazilian until the luciano that you are 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.720
 very young 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.599
 there is a way to teach football in the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.569
 television and it was a much more 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:06.930
 descriptive because we had the image 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.269
 we had to see what was 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.489
 then the narrators happened when the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.659
 people started to have 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.120
 football on tv 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.500
 he simply described what was 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.510
 happening 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.319
 man dominates the ball touches to the left 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.609
 dominated cross pelé goal of Brazil 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.010
 until valley luciano 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.090
 luciano do valle was the one who allowed himself 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.129
 bring emotion to a transmission and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.370
 You go and we 'll see some of you. 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.260
 these nations here first 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.470
 narrations of the valley of the snapper was very 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.810
 more radio than television and this 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.120
 emotion a goal scream 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.459
 luciano del valle shouted google talk and 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.000
 a powerful voice that he not only in the ra 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.500
 bo he shout gugu he was thrilled he 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.819
 transformed forever 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.889
 the transmissions of the Brazilian television 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.650
 and it is no wonder that the interactive sport 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.319
 has a way of transmitting much 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.669
 similar to the valley's 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.650
 that the galvão that another big name 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:13.290
 sports narration on luciano television 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.209
 of the valley is much closer to the sport 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.159
 interactive in this sense besides having 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.500
 been one of the sport's narrators 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:24.049
 interactive at first as I said is not 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.049
 A good night, but a change.
