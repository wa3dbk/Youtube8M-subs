case here it's about 2 cups of water in
that<00:04:04.860> faster<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.700> we<00:04:05.790> want<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.060> bring<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.420> up

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
that faster and we want to bring that up

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.140 
that faster and we want to bring that up
to<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> boil<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:08.040> whole<00:04:08.220> idea<00:04:08.610> here<00:04:08.730> now<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.060> to

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
to a boil the whole idea here now is to

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.729 
to a boil the whole idea here now is to
bring<00:04:09.330> up<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.630> boil<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.050> then<00:04:10.140> reduce<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.709> to

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
bring up the boil and then reduce it to

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.280 
bring up the boil and then reduce it to
simmer<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.090> will<00:04:12.239> slowly<00:04:12.600> cook<00:04:13.080> and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
simmer so it will slowly cook and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.590 
simmer so it will slowly cook and
tenderize<00:04:13.800> all<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.220> peas<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.790> make<00:04:15.570> a

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
tenderize all that peas and make a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.140 
tenderize all that peas and make a
lovely<00:04:16.049> sort<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.799> gravy<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:17.489> sauce<00:04:17.519> with
