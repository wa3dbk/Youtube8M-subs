00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello friends this is a tutorial about 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 how to organize to repair the tablet 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.160
 after it stays braked good 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 here we have the the downloaded file 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.740
 here is already with the description then 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.010
 I hope you follow the steps well so that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.320
 they will not have any problem like 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.130
 that the tablet that completely turned off 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.199
 like the tablet that are failures had 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.449
 very much in mind that tablets have to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.700
 be compatible and have to be installed 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.510
 the drivers 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 they are here that as shown in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 the tutorial is another way is also that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.690
 you go to development options and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.180
 activate the debug mode in case of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 that you can to be able to detect 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 the tablet easier then please 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.850
 I hope that will help them 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.850
 a lot of help 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.909
 well here we have the team more 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.600
 compressed and we have unpacked 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.909
 let's access the folder 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.280
 well here we have the files open 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.670
 the program 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.979
 and here in the program we load a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 image that will leave selection to 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.560
 where they have to select here they give 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.549
 click and there you have to place the image 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.229
 that is what rugat says 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.240
 then already loaded after he left in 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.909
 green as if it were ready and then 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.030
 here we go to the other step that its serious and 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.820
 I'm going to show you this little video 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 well here many times sometimes 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.920
 has stopped and that has blocked the account 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.690
 the tablet and you have to restart it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.040
 then this will also serve in 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.500
 if it also reaches them 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.360
 block but keep in mind that it's going 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.780
 to lose all the information they have 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 on the tablet then do not go to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.570
 hope that it will soon be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 information like music pictures or 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.160
 something like that because everything is going to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.100
 erase then 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.459
 I hope this tutorial goes 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.120
 helping you so much for you to give 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.090
 like and then subscribe to the channel if 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.840
 they want more good tutorials let's go here 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.330
 already having the system already loaded 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.800
 we have the menu key pressed we have 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.819
 to leave the menu key pressed 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.450
 while it is all the way then of 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.420
 of the work that is going to be done then 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.420
 if it is released it can be canceled 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.219
 then here we connect it 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.790
 we leave with the menu key pressed and the 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.680
 that appears when we connect appears a 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.530
 unknown device we give to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.930
 update to that unknown device 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.989
 let's say it is right to update the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.060
 software we give you look for software 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.629
 controller on the computer we select 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.219
 the folder that is where I left them the 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.959
 complete folder with drivers 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.319
 then in this case because they 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.530
 we would look in the folder I have it 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.380
 here in the yes then we look at the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:28.610
 folder that I look for you that is this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.610
 is this folder that says 1.29 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.709
 then they have to select well the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.709
 to be able to find the drivers 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.490
 we are there and we give in drivers 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.580
 we search according to the operating system if 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:53.890
 is 32 or 64 years of 64 tÃ©lam windows 7 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.790
 64 we give you to accept 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.069
 then follows here is beginning to 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.390
 install we give you yes because a 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.550
 warning as it is not a controller 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.890
 signed then that's why it comes out but 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.650
 then after giving it install it 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.570
 install this device and when installing 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.630
 the device look that behind gray 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.630
 Go to green which is where you are ready 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.180
 look there already happened to see 3 and 4 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.020
 then we close here 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.020
 once closed 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.530
 ready that we will not use it either 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.530
 then we also close this 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.560
 I'm ready then already having here already 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.380
 The next step is to keep in mind that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.970
 you should not release the menu key on the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:51.720
 east of this installation and already 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:55.600
 now we proceed to give you update or 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.200
 be a late great 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.680
 well then we give it if you do not think that 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.350
 starts 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.990
 to do your job 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.160
 this already takes a bit then I'll 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.160
 I'm going to cut a little 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.510
 Well, here we are finishing with the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.510
 steps then already here we finished and 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.520
 you already tell me how you 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.410
 went to each one with these simple steps 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.650
 each tablet has a different system 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.360
 so download the image
