00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.070
 crystal clear aquarium where 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.100
 bright healthy fish are swimming 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.660
 like birds soaring among pride like 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.390
 achieve such pure water 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.900
 answer you must use external 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.330
 filter by three types of filtrate 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.109
 mechanical to get rid of 10 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.539
 biological which will allow 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.339
 digest waste 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.859
 the fisherman and also the chemical one 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.230
 absorbs diodes and allows 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.620
 get rid of unwanted water color 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.989
 in the aquarium tetra x + external filter 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
 which has a substantial volume 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.309
 filter elements as well 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.710
 provides three types of filtering them 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.199
 fatherland make matter and blue clearly 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.899
 what is in the box is it directly 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.710
 sender itself flank adapter in which 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.350
 connect the filter head hoses 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.899
 entry tube cabin exit tube entry 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.780
 Now this innovation is the fact that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.400
 theater is the only company that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.300
 provided 3 filter to 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.520
 small fishes 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.970
 and also when they see they fell Peter 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.970
 filter time is + adapter 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.030
 flanks allows you to attach hoses to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.350
 to him man of filters 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.240
 perfected now in it goes the lock 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.130
 which does not allow just to break 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 This pro faucets thought with hoses not 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.470
 a device underneath it insures us 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.770
 as well as step flow control 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 which is much more convenient when you start 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.240
 Aquarium goal start filter you 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.670
 stream is pretty significant filtering in 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.950
 this filter comes from the bottom up 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.509
 now consider the filtration 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.500
 elements that are filters 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.399
 directly latest camera 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.630
 which is contained by the president and 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.630
 adsorbents for chemical filtration 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.970
 the last but one camera is white balls 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.970
 and clean filtering 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.320
 the second camera from the bottom up is 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 mechanical filtration with 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:13.320
 washcloths and the first chamber in the meeting 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 dirty water is when the filtration 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.740
 ceramics 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.140
 new filtration series 3x + aquafilter 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.510
 called this term there for his 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.660
 Reliable and complete to carry bag 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 on them tasks such as filtering water in 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.870
 natural and creatures where the podium like a game 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 you are one of the 8
