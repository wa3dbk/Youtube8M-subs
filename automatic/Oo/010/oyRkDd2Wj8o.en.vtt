00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.200
 and on such a beautiful sunset scenery 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.919
 you can easily bring that is put 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:21.010
 that no, what is it? 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:23.050
 the box before we can take you 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.260
 how hard it is for the simple 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.810
 Albanian farmer needs to get up early 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.440
 in the morning load the truck fresh in 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.200
 hens 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.480
 and go go and go for a strange 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
 country road well, which in general is 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 no conditions for normal transportation 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.140
 This product does not provide 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.089
 Generally what justifies accordingly 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.030
 the full name of this game is bad roads 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.460
 bad roads such roads well even ours 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.199
 siberian region i dreamed 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 translate them full truck on 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.920
 full chicken for colonel sanders 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.739
 this is just unreal 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 however, if we minimize the amount 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.649
 chickens in our van then it is quite possible 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.479
 gently translate them to a place though 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.369
 Who am I lying to, I, too, Andrews Standard 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.890
 endless side-scroller so we just 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.259
 moving on very, very rough 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 areas we need to deliver 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.439
 at least not 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.770
 well at least one chicken well please 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.479
 ok, let's start first yes our truck is not 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.399
 very convenient but in the development process 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.140
 plot we can get you new 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.030
 and new vehicles which 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.920
 will allow us not to commit such here 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.479
 mistakes where accelerating at some 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.210
 scary ala-bam scam bridge 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.939
 we will lose the last chicken and colonel 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.560
 Sanders will be sad 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.009
 ah no well what is 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 yes no of course these roads did not dream 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.109
 even to our pink todors but incidentally for 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.509
 In order to remedy this situation, we 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:52.810
 we can purchase, for example, some 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:55.210
 more or less decent truck and so we 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.679
 took some weird big foot and how 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.289
 100 times the most comfortable 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.270
 the amount of chicken namely 3 pieces per 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.909
 cages that accordingly should 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.890
 allow us to advance well at least on 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.890
 some for this rather complicated 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.420
 cross country movement of course 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 make it difficult and rains bridges are different 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.440
 data constructs that are kind of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.709
 should not distract our attention but 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.380
 where are you no lightning, too, by the way interfere 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.810
 although I havenâ€™t heard about 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.660
 texas in alabama didn't happen here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 such strange rain with thunderstorms 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 however one box of chicken to bring 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.250
 much simpler and it really is 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.600
 let no where are you 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.980
 if we are Tamil one level but we 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.959
 earn enough 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 coins then we can get access 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.110
 Well, for example to some winter landscape 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.300
 monetary montana or minnesota or here 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.269
 for example it is very similar to paris well 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.489
 let it be paris and try 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.069
 go well at least a small piece of this 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.220
 tracks because 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.220
 country music changed to strange 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.049
 standard Parisian melodies and now 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.650
 we can safely enjoy the light 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.010
 lanterns 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.170
 try to drive on well let it be 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.470
 There are rural fields of course although I in this 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.110
 very very unsure of some strange 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.560
 arches and hens have not quit yet and we already 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.480
 drove h300 well almost 300 meters before we 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.000
 drove 300 meters and lost two 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.170
 Chicken right away 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.109
 control here is pretty basic 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.579
 there is no interaction with the sensor 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.170
 positions of the smartphone so we just 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.049
 either we can slow down either 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.420
 somehow accelerate though I would accelerate 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.299
 I did not advise it because it is so under the slope 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.500
 machine and very energetic so no well 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.380
 but what is the new record 551 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.329
 meter that can not but rejoice 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.220
 but generally in the game bad road 2 you can 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.109
 acquire both level and 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.220
 vehicles that we can 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.310
 this is an example to purchase 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.329
 eagle cost 200 coins coins we collect 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.810
 on the track itself 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.340
 we choose the track we buy and we can 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.380
 choose one of the trucks that us 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.450
 already available here for example we may be 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.819
 a kind of truck is sometimes called 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.950
 transport it in principle paolo 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.959
 Barschine of hens is quite problematic 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.720
 but according to vietnam from the traditional 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.410
 Vietnamese music is pretty 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.370
 fun track dark 1 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.960
 pretty well where are you not wrong 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.120
 lightning hinders much in progress 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.970
 on the highway because at this moment and not 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.830
 you see nothing at all on the screen and at the same 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.300
 time there might happen some very 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.520
 an unpleasant mound but where there is no and I 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.500
 lost no everyone look obliged one 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.180
 hen 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.740
 Well, Colonel Sanders will even bring 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.530
 we must be satisfied therefore we 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.389
 try to drive as much as possible 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.720
 long distance 400 14 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.849
 meters 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.729
 sorry further here we move forward 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.650
 could not actually here such 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.060
 this strange toy is bad road we 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.860
 actually found in the open spaces of the network 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.349
 several of its variations, one of which 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.210
 the night seemed strange to us 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.340
 traveling around Siberia 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.349
 but probably not we will tell you how not to 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.690
 next time, for now 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.580
 I will try to drive this very canyon on 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.240
 new jeep well please 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.240

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:33.220
 minus 1. lightning canyon minus 1 more 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.830
 minus all the chickens are not there so what 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.310
 Here is a strange but rather interesting 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.810
 endless toy called bad road 2 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.030
 by the way in google play it is free so 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.040
 what if someone is interested in mercy 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.170
 please tell us in the comments about 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.180
 tom how far you have come 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.130
 what vehicles purchased well 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.990
 and whether it is worth playing such games 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.440
 Well, that's all it was android insider 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.440
 bye everyone
