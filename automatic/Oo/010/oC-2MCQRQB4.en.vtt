00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the word halo and if we add that force

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.130 
the word halo and if we add that force
at<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> four<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.250> halo<00:02:23.400> 4<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.390> eight<00:02:24.540> now

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
at the four and halo 4 we can eight now

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.229 
at the four and halo 4 we can eight now
there<00:02:25.590> are<00:02:25.620> three<00:02:25.739> other<00:02:26.100> ale<00:02:26.310> games<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
there are three other ale games at that

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.780 
there are three other ale games at that
3<00:02:27.510> into<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> 8th<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.530> makes<00:02:28.709> 11<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.160> the

eleventh month of the year is November
ah<00:02:33.780> there<00:02:34.470> were<00:02:34.590> more<00:02:34.770> than<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:35.010> three<00:02:35.340> games

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
ah there were more than just three games

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.180 
ah there were more than just three games
oh<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.110> I'd<00:02:37.530> hate<00:02:37.739> for<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> get

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
oh right I'd hate for this to get

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
oh right I'd hate for this to get
confusing<00:02:38.610> now<00:02:39.060> as<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:39.900> know<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.800> take

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
confusing now as we all know if we take

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.130 
confusing now as we all know if we take
11<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.550> subtract<00:02:41.910> five<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.840> six

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
11 and subtract five from it we get six

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.070 
11 and subtract five from it we get six
that's<00:02:43.830> how<00:02:44.100> we'll<00:02:44.340> remember<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.820> day

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that's how we'll remember the day

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.660 
that's how we'll remember the day
november<00:02:46.080> six<00:02:46.110> wait<00:02:46.769> why<00:02:47.100> did<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.310> subtract

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
november six wait why did you subtract

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.330 
november six wait why did you subtract
five<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.600> halo<00:02:48.900> 4<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.070> one

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
five because this is halo 4 which is one

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.660 
five because this is halo 4 which is one
less<00:02:50.700> than<00:02:50.970> 5<00:02:51.209> 11<00:02:52.140> less<00:02:52.320> five<00:02:52.590> six<00:02:53.100> come<00:02:53.610> on

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
less than 5 11 less five six come on

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.080 
less than 5 11 less five six come on
keep<00:02:54.360> up<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:55.290> brain<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.280> broke<00:02:56.760> of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
keep up I think my brain just broke of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.790 
keep up I think my brain just broke of
course<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.540> calculate<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> air<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.470> simply

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
course to calculate the air we simply

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
course to calculate the air we simply
multiply<00:02:58.920> 11<00:02:59.610> times<00:02:59.850> sex<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.630> give<00:03:00.780> us<00:03:00.900> 66<00:03:01.320> and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
multiply 11 times sex to give us 66 and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.780 
multiply 11 times sex to give us 66 and
66<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.060> made<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.480> two<00:03:03.780> sixes<00:03:04.440> 2<00:03:05.100> times<00:03:05.400> X<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
66 is made up of two sixes 2 times X the

66 is made up of two sixes 2 times X the
1205<00:03:06.360> oh<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:07.829> got<00:03:07.980> 2012<00:03:08.549> why<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.299> working

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
1205 oh you got 2012 why is this working
