I<00:00:00.199> wanted<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.260> make<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> follow-up<00:00:02.280> video<00:00:02.520> here

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
I wanted to make a follow-up video here

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.220 
I wanted to make a follow-up video here
on<00:00:03.389> my<00:00:03.659> vintage<00:00:04.049> RC<00:00:04.620> 10-team<00:00:05.100> car<00:00:05.480> if<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.990> look

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
on my vintage RC 10-team car if you look

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.459 
on my vintage RC 10-team car if you look
back<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.710> video<00:00:08.160> history<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.880> made<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.990> video

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
back in my video history I made a video

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
back in my video history I made a video
about<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.639> some<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.630> things<00:00:12.870> I

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
about this and and some of the things I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.169 
about this and and some of the things I
did<00:00:13.170> like<00:00:13.530> dealing<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> battery<00:00:14.820> tray

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
did like dealing with the battery tray

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.529 
did like dealing with the battery tray
and<00:00:15.599> how<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> fit<00:00:16.740> modern<00:00:17.130> rims<00:00:17.510> onto<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and how to fit modern rims onto a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.460 
and how to fit modern rims onto a
vintage<00:00:18.960> RC<00:00:19.439> ten<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.119> at<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
vintage RC ten and at the time the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
vintage RC ten and at the time the
recommendation<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.220> had<00:00:23.430> made<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.269> use<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
recommendation I had made was to use a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.560 
recommendation I had made was to use a
longer<00:00:25.710> arm<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:26.670> guys<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:27.240> Dino

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
longer arm like these guys from Dino

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
longer arm like these guys from Dino
Tech<00:00:27.840> Racing<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.529> nice<00:00:28.789> very<00:00:29.789> durable

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
Tech Racing is very nice very durable

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.470 
Tech Racing is very nice very durable

Delrin arms and to use a b4 cv d and a
modern<00:00:36.840> hub<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.860> vintage<00:00:38.790> hub<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.930> use

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
modern hub or vintage hub and then use

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
modern hub or vintage hub and then use
spacers<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.739> everything<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:42.020> all<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
spacers and everything to get all the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
spacers and everything to get all the
spacing<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.460> drive<00:00:44.760> pin<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
spacing right so that your drive pin is

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
spacing right so that your drive pin is
right<00:00:45.960> where<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> should<00:00:46.379> be

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
right where it should be

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
right where it should be
I<00:00:47.760> had<00:00:48.450> eventually<00:00:48.690> settled<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.230> using<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I had eventually settled on using the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240 
I had eventually settled on using the
original<00:00:50.340> vintage<00:00:50.520> hub<00:00:51.590> but<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> ran<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:52.890> some

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
original vintage hub but I ran into some

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.569 
original vintage hub but I ran into some
problems<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.949> vintage<00:00:56.250> hub

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
problems here because on the vintage hub

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.299 
problems here because on the vintage hub
it<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:57.750> flanged<00:00:58.230> bearings<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.829> either<00:00:58.980> side

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it has flanged bearings on either side

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
it has flanged bearings on either side
of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> housing<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> inner

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of the housing but the the inner

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
of the housing but the the inner
diameter<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.460> those<00:01:02.609> bearings<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.530> larger

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
diameter of those bearings are larger

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.030 
diameter of those bearings are larger
than<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> diameter<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:07.010> drive<00:01:08.010> shaft

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
than the diameter of the drive shaft

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.280 
than the diameter of the drive shaft
here<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> did<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> took<00:01:10.939> two

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
here so what I did was I took two

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
here so what I did was I took two
bearings<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.380> forget<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> size<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.280> fit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bearings I forget the size but that fit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.280 
bearings I forget the size but that fit
to<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> drive<00:01:15.479> shaft<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.170> them

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to this drive shaft and I put them

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
to this drive shaft and I put them
inside<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.400> housing<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> surrounded<00:01:18.570> them

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
inside this housing and surrounded them

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
inside this housing and surrounded them
by<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:18.990> flange<00:01:19.290> bearings<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:21.259> like

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
by these flange bearings then I had like

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.740 
by these flange bearings then I had like
a<00:01:22.320> bushing<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a bushing in the back just to get the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
a bushing in the back just to get the
right<00:01:24.780> spacing<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.369> drive<00:01:26.909> pin<00:01:27.150> here

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
right spacing so this the drive pin here

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
right spacing so this the drive pin here
wasn't<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.750> far<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.259> too<00:01:28.590> far<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
wasn't too far out or too far in and it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.569 
wasn't too far out or too far in and it
worked<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.479> while<00:01:31.400> but<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
worked for a little while but the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.460 
worked for a little while but the
problem<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> bushing<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.960> eating<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
problem was that bushing was eating up

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.569 
problem was that bushing was eating up
against<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.640> outside<00:01:37.040> housing<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
against the outside housing of this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.420 
against the outside housing of this
inner<00:01:38.790> flange<00:01:39.570> bearing<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.320> eventually<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
inner flange bearing and eventually that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
inner flange bearing and eventually that
wore<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.140> housing<00:01:43.500> fell<00:01:43.680> apart<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
wore out and the housing fell apart and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
wore out and the housing fell apart and
so<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> drive<00:01:45.000> shaft<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.570> sort<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so then the drive shaft just sort of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.160 
so then the drive shaft just sort of
moved<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.460> rather<00:01:47.460> freely<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.750> there

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
moved in and out rather freely so there

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.219 
moved in and out rather freely so there
wasn't<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.649> durable<00:01:50.369> solution<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:52.200> other

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
wasn't a very durable solution the other

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.870 
wasn't a very durable solution the other
problem<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.430> also<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.270> had<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.630> use

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
problem was also that you had to use

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.749 
problem was also that you had to use
some<00:01:57.079> down<00:01:58.079> travel<00:01:58.530> limiters<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> inside

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
some down travel limiters on the inside

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.870 
some down travel limiters on the inside
of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> shock<00:02:00.149> body<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.409> keep<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.460> drive

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of the shock body to keep the drive

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.810 
of the shock body to keep the drive
shaft<00:02:03.590> or<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.619> dog<00:02:04.920> room<00:02:05.130> from<00:02:05.310> popping<00:02:05.700> out

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
shaft or the dog room from popping out

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.889 
shaft or the dog room from popping out
of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.829> out<00:02:07.829> drive<00:02:08.780> from<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
of the the out drive from the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.429 
of the the out drive from the
differential

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
differential

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.309 
differential
so<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.689> figured<00:02:13.689> I'd<00:02:13.780> try<00:02:13.900> something<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> little

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
so I figured I'd try something a little

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.490 
so I figured I'd try something a little
different<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:15.360> looked<00:02:16.360> around<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.989> saw<00:02:17.200> that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
different I looked around and I saw that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.030 
different I looked around and I saw that
people<00:02:18.489> are<00:02:18.579> using<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.879> much<00:02:19.090> simpler<00:02:19.689> solution

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
people are using a much simpler solution

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.490 
people are using a much simpler solution
so<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.069> can<00:02:21.489> go<00:02:21.610> back<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> original

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
so you can go back to the original

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.420 
so you can go back to the original
suspension<00:02:23.500> arms<00:02:23.920> or<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.849> can<00:02:25.000> use<00:02:25.150> these<00:02:25.360> rpm

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
suspension arms or you can use these rpm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
suspension arms or you can use these rpm
re-released<00:02:27.430> their<00:02:28.390> arms<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.019> RC<00:02:29.349> ten

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
re-released their arms for the RC ten

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.190 
re-released their arms for the RC ten
you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:29.950> get<00:02:30.220> these<00:02:30.340> from<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.849> main<00:02:31.030> hobbies<00:02:31.450> as

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
you can get these from a main hobbies as

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.110 
you can get these from a main hobbies as
the<00:02:32.440> front<00:02:32.709> kid<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:32.950> had<00:02:33.340> yet<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.519> install<00:02:33.909> that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
the front kid I had yet to install that

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.930 
the front kid I had yet to install that
and<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.810> rear<00:02:35.590> arms<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.489> okay<00:02:36.909> so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
and this is the rear arms so okay so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.360 
and this is the rear arms so okay so

rear hub carrier for a b4 or B 44 so
this<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.579> an<00:02:51.700> RPM<00:02:52.150> rear<00:02:52.989> hub<00:02:53.230> carrier<00:02:53.620> which<00:02:54.489> is

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
this is an RPM rear hub carrier which is

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.430 
this is an RPM rear hub carrier which is
for<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> B<00:02:56.290> 4<00:02:56.560> B<00:02:56.590> 44<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.609> an<00:02:57.730> SC<00:02:58.030> ten<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:59.290> you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
for a B 4 B 44 or an SC ten and then you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.250 
for a B 4 B 44 or an SC ten and then you
the<00:03:00.099> hub<00:03:00.549> carrier<00:03:00.819> is<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.909> little<00:03:01.209> bit<00:03:01.359> wider<00:03:01.989> at

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
the hub carrier is a little bit wider at

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.780 
the hub carrier is a little bit wider at
the<00:03:02.290> at<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.799> bottom<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.459> just<00:03:03.609> have<00:03:03.760> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
the at the bottom so you just have to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.440 
the at the bottom so you just have to
shave<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.329> down<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.470> fits<00:03:05.739> inside<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
shave it down so it fits inside this

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.509 
shave it down so it fits inside this
opening<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:08.409> that's<00:03:08.980> pretty<00:03:09.280> easy<00:03:09.340> to

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
opening here but that's pretty easy to

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.970 
opening here but that's pretty easy to
do<00:03:09.730> just<00:03:09.849> do<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.239> with<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.389> dremel<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.980> then

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
do just do that with a dremel and then

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.189 
do just do that with a dremel and then
once<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:13.200> would<00:03:14.200> use<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.709> B<00:03:15.190> 44

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
once you have that you would use a B 44

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.699 
once you have that you would use a B 44
rear<00:03:17.220> CBD<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.790> fits<00:03:19.090> perfectly<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.560> don't

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
rear CBD and it fits perfectly you don't

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.129 
rear CBD and it fits perfectly you don't
have<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.010> do<00:03:21.099> any<00:03:21.299> shimming<00:03:22.299> or<00:03:22.540> any<00:03:22.660> fiddling

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
have to do any shimming or any fiddling

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.589 
have to do any shimming or any fiddling
around<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:24.489> perfectly<00:03:24.970> fine<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.269> can

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
around if it's perfectly fine you can

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.720 
around if it's perfectly fine you can
have<00:03:25.780> full<00:03:26.530> down<00:03:26.769> travel<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.340> suspension

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
have full down travel on the suspension

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.420 
have full down travel on the suspension
arm<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:29.410> may<00:03:29.739> be<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.859> little<00:03:29.949> hard<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.220> see

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
arm and I may be a little hard to see

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.610 
arm and I may be a little hard to see
here<00:03:30.459> with<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.849> lighting<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.230> dog-bone

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
here with the lighting but the dog-bone

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.250 
here with the lighting but the dog-bone
will<00:03:32.859> not<00:03:33.069> pop<00:03:33.400> out<00:03:33.609> of<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.019> differential<00:03:35.019> out

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
will not pop out of the differential out

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.939 
will not pop out of the differential out
drive<00:03:35.530> okay<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:37.030> standard<00:03:37.780> bearings<00:03:38.199> no<00:03:38.620> you

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
drive okay so standard bearings no you

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.789 
drive okay so standard bearings no you
know<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.730> normal<00:03:40.000> things<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.530> would<00:03:41.650> do

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
know all the normal things you would do

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.430 
know all the normal things you would do
for<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:42.099> B<00:03:42.489> 4<00:03:42.790> B<00:03:42.819> 44<00:03:43.540> rear<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.169> got<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.410> two

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
for a B 4 B 44 rear so you got the two

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.319 
for a B 4 B 44 rear so you got the two
bearings<00:03:44.889> in<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.040> housing<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:46.000> are<00:03:46.150> two

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
bearings in the housing there are two

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.180 
bearings in the housing there are two
shims<00:03:46.629> here<00:03:46.959> behind<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.379> blue<00:03:47.620> plate<00:03:47.949> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
shims here behind this blue plate and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.699 
shims here behind this blue plate and
your<00:03:48.699> dry<00:03:48.910> pin<00:03:49.209> just<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.840> modern<00:03:50.139> setup<00:03:50.470> and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
your dry pin just a modern setup and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.229 
your dry pin just a modern setup and
that's<00:03:51.160> it

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
that's it

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.309 
that's it
again<00:03:53.019> B<00:03:53.260> 44<00:03:53.889> rear<00:03:54.430> CVD<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:56.019> if<00:03:56.109> it's

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
again B 44 rear CVD and if it's

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.800 
again B 44 rear CVD and if it's
perfectly<00:03:56.680> fine<00:03:56.889> on<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.159> vintage<00:03:57.430> IC<00:03:57.819> 10<00:03:58.060> and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
perfectly fine on a vintage IC 10 and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.319 
perfectly fine on a vintage IC 10 and
that<00:03:58.870> allows<00:03:59.139> you<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.319> use<00:03:59.470> modern<00:03:59.859> rims<00:04:00.329> on

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
that allows you to use modern rims on

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.720 
that allows you to use modern rims on
this<00:04:01.599> chassis<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.829> just<00:04:03.250> wanted<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.549> share

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
this chassis so I just wanted to share

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.080 
this chassis so I just wanted to share
that<00:04:03.760> very<00:04:04.629> quickly<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.230> much<00:04:05.470> easier<00:04:06.090> way

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that very quickly it's a much easier way

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.280 
that very quickly it's a much easier way
of<00:04:08.729> modernizing<00:04:09.729> the<00:04:09.970> rear<00:04:10.150> end<00:04:10.359> of<00:04:11.109> this

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
of modernizing the rear end of this

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.369 
of modernizing the rear end of this
chassis<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:12.000> am<00:04:13.000> going<00:04:13.299> through<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.750> making<00:04:14.229> a

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
chassis I am going through and making a

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.770 
chassis I am going through and making a
few<00:04:14.560> more<00:04:14.739> changes<00:04:15.129> I<00:04:15.220> want<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.430> try<00:04:15.639> big<00:04:16.599> bore

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
few more changes I want to try big bore
