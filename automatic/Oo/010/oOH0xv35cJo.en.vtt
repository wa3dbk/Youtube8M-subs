00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
we're going to be able to catch the one

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.140 
we're going to be able to catch the one
quickly<00:00:10.680> cuz<00:00:10.950> he'll<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.250> chasing<00:00:11.700> us<00:00:11.850> around

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
quickly cuz he'll be chasing us around

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.940 
quickly cuz he'll be chasing us around
and<00:00:12.450> then<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.140> other<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.500> will<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.890> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and then the other one will see it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.320 
and then the other one will see it
because<00:00:14.130> they're<00:00:14.280> smart<00:00:14.610> animals<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.180> going

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
because they're smart animals it's going

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.580 
because they're smart animals it's going
to<00:00:15.390> see<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.780> there's<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.320> trouble

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
to see that there's going to be trouble

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760 
to see that there's going to be trouble
so<00:00:17.430> she's<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.720> hide<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so she's going to want to hide and and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.250 
so she's going to want to hide and and
to<00:00:20.460> move<00:00:20.640> animals<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.690> we<00:00:21.930> need<00:00:22.110> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to move animals like this we need to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070 
to move animals like this we need to
move<00:00:22.500> both<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.400> they're<00:00:23.789> gonna<00:00:23.970> remain<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
move both if they're gonna remain a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
move both if they're gonna remain a
compatible<00:00:25.980> couple<00:00:26.220> being<00:00:26.580> disturbed<00:00:26.940> too

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
compatible couple being disturbed too

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
compatible couple being disturbed too
much<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.690> by<00:00:27.900> our<00:00:28.109> people<00:00:28.320> walking<00:00:28.830> back<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
much here by our people walking back and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.950 
much here by our people walking back and
forth<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:29.910> they're<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.600> breeding

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
forth all the time they're not breeding

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.529 
forth all the time they're not breeding
successfully<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.609> we<00:00:32.729> want<00:00:32.909> to<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.210> them<00:00:33.449> in

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
successfully so we want to take them in

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.899 
successfully so we want to take them in
an<00:00:33.659> area<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.409> will<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.909> basically

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
an area where they will be basically

00:00:35.909 --> 00:01:16.780 
an area where they will be basically
hidden<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.359> the<00:00:36.479> public

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.340 

I've<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.150> alligator<00:01:18.690> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> farm<00:01:19.200> would

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
I've got an alligator at the farm would

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.200 
I've got an alligator at the farm would
use<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> hole<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.190> tape<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.030> he<00:01:21.090> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
use a hole well with tape on and he can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:02:15.750 
use a hole well with tape on and he can
stretch<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:29.510> okay

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.220 

I'm<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.820> professor<00:02:17.240> from<00:02:17.360> Louisiana<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
I'm a professor from Louisiana and I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.780 
I'm a professor from Louisiana and I
have<00:02:18.380> an<00:02:18.500> alligator<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.070> crocodile<00:02:19.460> research

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
have an alligator and crocodile research

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400 
have an alligator and crocodile research
program<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.240> I'm<00:02:20.360> studying<00:02:20.600> their<00:02:20.960> immune

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
program and I'm studying their immune

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.550 
program and I'm studying their immune
system<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.340> draw<00:02:23.000> blood<00:02:23.209> from<00:02:23.540> them<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
system so I draw blood from them and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.780 
system so I draw blood from them and
we'll<00:02:24.650> take<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.980> back<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> lab<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.580> let<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
we'll take it back to the lab and let it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
we'll take it back to the lab and let it
clot<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.209> collect<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> serum<00:02:27.080> which<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.410> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
clot and collect the serum which is the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.990 
clot and collect the serum which is the
technical<00:02:28.459> discus<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> make<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.820> serum<00:02:31.820> is

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
technical discus to make the serum is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.280 
technical discus to make the serum is
the<00:02:32.120> liquid<00:02:32.420> part<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.690> blood<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.050> after

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the liquid part of the blood and after

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.540 
the liquid part of the blood and after
eight<00:02:33.380> o'clock<00:02:33.410> I'll<00:02:33.830> collect<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.220> serum

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
eight o'clock I'll collect the serum

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.250 
eight o'clock I'll collect the serum
when<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:35.000> we're<00:02:35.780> looking<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
when we can we're looking for the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.230 
when we can we're looking for the
antibiotic<00:02:36.950> properties<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.700> these<00:02:37.790> animals

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
antibiotic properties of these animals

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.940 
antibiotic properties of these animals
because<00:02:38.420> these<00:02:38.630> animals<00:02:38.810> are<00:02:39.140> very

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
because these animals are very

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.470 
because these animals are very
aggressive<00:02:40.310> toward<00:02:40.850> members<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.270> their<00:02:41.360> own

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
aggressive toward members of their own

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.510 
aggressive toward members of their own
species<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.080> they<00:02:42.350> fight<00:02:42.650> quite<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.280> bit

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
species and they fight quite a bit

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.020 
species and they fight quite a bit
especially<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:44.420> territorial<00:02:45.170> disputes<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
especially in territorial disputes and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.920 
especially in territorial disputes and
during<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.090> mating<00:02:47.270> season<00:02:47.420> when<00:02:47.810> they're

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
during the mating season when they're

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.170 
during the mating season when they're
defending<00:02:48.350> nests<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.950> they'll<00:02:49.550> rip<00:02:49.730> limbs

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
defending nests and they'll rip limbs

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.050 
defending nests and they'll rip limbs
clean<00:02:50.540> off<00:02:50.720> one<00:02:50.930> another<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.640> fact<00:02:52.850> is

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
clean off one another and the fact is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.370 
clean off one another and the fact is
despite<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.420> fact<00:02:53.750> they<00:02:53.900> live<00:02:54.080> out<00:02:54.230> in

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
despite the fact they live out in

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.590 
despite the fact they live out in
environments<00:02:55.130> where<00:02:55.940> there's<00:02:56.300> lots<00:02:56.450> of

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
environments where there's lots of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.210 
environments where there's lots of
potentially<00:02:57.050> infectious<00:02:57.410> bacteria<00:02:58.100> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
potentially infectious bacteria and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.790 
potentially infectious bacteria and
fungi<00:02:58.640> these<00:02:59.450> animals<00:02:59.840> heal<00:03:00.080> these<00:03:00.290> massive

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
fungi these animals heal these massive

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.740 
fungi these animals heal these massive
wounds<00:03:01.010> heal<00:03:01.250> without<00:03:01.370> infection<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.630> I'm

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
wounds heal without infection and so I'm

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
wounds heal without infection and so I'm
studying<00:03:02.930> their<00:03:03.200> immune<00:03:03.440> system<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.370> of

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
studying their immune system and some of

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.380 
studying their immune system and some of
the<00:03:04.550> things<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:04.820> found<00:03:05.000> have<00:03:05.180> been<00:03:05.269> pretty

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the things we found have been pretty

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.240 
the things we found have been pretty
amazing<00:03:05.630> we<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.350> shown<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.830> American

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
amazing we have shown that the American

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.520 
amazing we have shown that the American
alligator<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.120> actually<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.140> couple<00:03:09.170> other
