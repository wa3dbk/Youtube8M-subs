cranker I thought people do it on the
ignition<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.520> started<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
ignition you know they just started and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
ignition you know they just started and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
let it crank I'm gonna do it do the S

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
let it crank I'm gonna do it do the S
terminal<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.620> crank<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> over<00:00:41.160> get

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
terminal and just crank it over get

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.240 
terminal and just crank it over get
everything<00:00:41.520> primered<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.420> before<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.989> them
