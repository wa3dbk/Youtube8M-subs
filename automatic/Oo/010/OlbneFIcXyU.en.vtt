00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
from nothing to something now I'm going

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.850 
from nothing to something now I'm going
to<00:02:05.100> turn<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.370> over<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.260> again<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to turn it over and do it again so I

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.300 
to turn it over and do it again so I
have<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.310> take<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.910> apart<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.160> have

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
have to take this apart and then I have

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.110 
have to take this apart and then I have
to<00:02:14.430> rearrange<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:17.280> actually<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.910> kind

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
to rearrange and it actually that kind

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.810 
to rearrange and it actually that kind
of<00:02:18.240> looks<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.820> so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
of looks like I'm not going to do it so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.790 
of looks like I'm not going to do it so
that<00:02:20.970> most<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> time<00:02:21.660> until<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
that most of the time until it and so I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.070 
that most of the time until it and so I
do<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.490> because<00:02:24.270> I'm<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.510> getting<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
do do it because I'm just getting and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.890 
do do it because I'm just getting and
ready<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.000> funny<00:02:27.540> thing<00:02:27.810> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
ready to do it the the funny thing is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.990 
ready to do it the the funny thing is
that<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.290> always<00:02:28.650> feels<00:02:29.160> awkward<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.820> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that it always feels awkward like it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:42.530 
that it always feels awkward like it's
not<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> work<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:41.670> folding<00:02:41.970> something

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
not going to work I'm folding something

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.030 
not going to work I'm folding something
on<00:02:42.720> something<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:43.230> already<00:02:43.320> folded<00:02:43.680> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
on something that's already folded and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.030 
on something that's already folded and
then<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:44.550> rearranging<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.890> putting<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
then I'm rearranging it and putting it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.740 
then I'm rearranging it and putting it
back<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.460> different<00:02:47.790> position<00:02:47.910> where<00:02:48.480> some

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
back in a different position where some

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.540 
back in a different position where some
things<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:49.230> released<00:02:49.740> from<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.190> we're

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
things are released from that we're

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.460 
things are released from that we're
trapped<00:02:50.880> inside<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.170> one<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.410> those

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
trapped inside this is one of those

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890 
trapped inside this is one of those
parts<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.920> always<00:02:53.250> people<00:02:54.209> get<00:02:54.360> hesitant

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
parts that always people get hesitant

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
parts that always people get hesitant
about<00:02:55.020> it's<00:02:55.440> only<00:02:55.680> good<00:02:55.920> at<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> end<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.489> this

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
about it's only good at the end of this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.680 
about it's only good at the end of this
process<00:02:58.520> see<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.640> middle<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.150> seat<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
process see the middle of this seat you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.930 
process see the middle of this seat you
saw<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.290> stress<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> was<00:03:02.910> like

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
saw all the stress in there it was like

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.210 
saw all the stress in there it was like
ahh<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.320> okay<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.770> have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.130> go

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
ahh and then it like okay you have to go

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
ahh and then it like okay you have to go
right<00:03:05.400> through<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.090> not<00:03:06.510> stop<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
right through that and not stop in the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.540 
right through that and not stop in the
middle<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.160> really

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
middle there because then it's really

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.220 
middle there because then it's really
unhappy<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:11.010> middle<00:03:11.340> part<00:03:11.989> I'm<00:03:12.989> not<00:03:13.050> going

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
unhappy that middle part I'm not going

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.140 
unhappy that middle part I'm not going
to<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.500> drawing<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:13.980> anytime<00:03:14.280> soon

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
yes you try to strive for the final

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.520 
yes you try to strive for the final
thing<00:03:23.860> being<00:03:24.070> good<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:24.780> you're<00:03:25.780> also<00:03:25.900> very

thing being good but you're also very

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.350 
thing being good but you're also very
well<00:03:26.710> aware<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:27.190> how<00:03:27.520> beautiful<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.000> process

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
well aware of how beautiful the process

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.290 
well aware of how beautiful the process

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
what's special about what that object

00:03:36.100 --> 00:04:01.440 
what's special about what that object
was<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.730> how<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:36.880> got<00:03:37.090> made

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.500 

fine<00:04:02.450> work<00:04:02.810> there<00:04:03.170> I'm<00:04:03.829> pretty<00:04:04.159> good<00:04:04.510> there's

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
fine work there I'm pretty good there's

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.490 
fine work there I'm pretty good there's
many<00:04:05.810> forms<00:04:06.349> that<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.890> rejected<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.760> set<00:04:08.180> out

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
many forms that I rejected and set out

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.530 
many forms that I rejected and set out
that<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:09.650> doesn't<00:04:09.769> have<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.579> nice<00:04:10.909> enough<00:04:11.150> form

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
that one doesn't have a nice enough form

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.199 
that one doesn't have a nice enough form
and<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.049> they<00:04:12.319> just<00:04:12.530> kind<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:12.950> go<00:04:13.730> into<00:04:13.940> this

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
and then they just kind of go into this

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.500 
and then they just kind of go into this
pile<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.840> boxes<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.910> rejected<00:04:16.910> stuffs

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:30.779 

there's<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.720> tower<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:22.810> there's<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.169> flower

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.240 

the<00:04:31.789> tails<00:04:32.180> of<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.780> flower<00:04:33.020> aren't<00:04:33.470> perfect

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
the tails of a flower aren't perfect

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.610 
the tails of a flower aren't perfect
they're<00:04:34.510> pretty<00:04:35.510> regular<00:04:35.960> around<00:04:36.169> they'll

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
they're pretty regular around they'll

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.260 
they're pretty regular around they'll
all<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.979> basically<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.789> same<00:04:37.910> shape<00:04:38.150> but

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
all have basically the same shape but

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.180 
all have basically the same shape but
the<00:04:38.389> kind<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.660> organic<00:04:39.169> element<00:04:39.620> creeps<00:04:39.949> into

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the kind of organic element creeps into

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.680 
the kind of organic element creeps into
it<00:04:40.479> saying<00:04:41.479> about<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.699> that<00:04:43.699> is<00:04:43.940> interesting

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
it saying about this that is interesting

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.409 
it saying about this that is interesting
is<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.810> all<00:04:45.020> these<00:04:45.260> planes<00:04:45.680> would<00:04:46.610> go<00:04:46.970> in<00:04:47.210> one

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
is that all these planes would go in one

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.450 
is that all these planes would go in one
plane<00:04:47.750> if<00:04:47.990> there<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.530> no<00:04:48.680> dimension<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.250> paper

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
plane if there was no dimension to paper

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.240 
plane if there was no dimension to paper
it<00:04:49.789> was<00:04:49.880> an<00:04:50.000> ideal<00:04:50.330> Euclidean<00:04:51.080> plane<00:04:51.250> this

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
it was an ideal Euclidean plane this

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.750 
it was an ideal Euclidean plane this
would<00:04:52.430> all<00:04:52.580> lay<00:04:52.880> flat<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:54.340> every<00:04:55.340> single<00:04:55.669> one

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
would all lay flat and every single one

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.010 
would all lay flat and every single one
of<00:04:55.820> these<00:04:55.940> all<00:04:56.180> these<00:04:56.300> little<00:04:56.510> polygons

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
of these all these little polygons

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.750 
of these all these little polygons
heaped<00:04:57.289> on<00:04:57.470> each<00:04:57.620> other<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.160> connected<00:04:58.610> in

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
heaped on each other and connected in

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.029 
heaped on each other and connected in
the<00:04:58.910> plane<00:04:59.090> would<00:04:59.270> just<00:04:59.330> be<00:04:59.599> one<00:05:00.500> plane<00:05:00.770> but

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
the plane would just be one plane but

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:12.090 
the plane would just be one plane but
then<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.750> can<00:05:03.200> stand

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.020 

even<00:05:13.100> though<00:05:13.190> it's<00:05:13.370> not<00:05:13.430> good<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.790> do<00:05:13.910> this

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
even though it's not good to do this

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.060 
even though it's not good to do this
many<00:05:14.270> many<00:05:14.360> times<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:15.080> does<00:05:15.140> come<00:05:15.950> apart

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
many many times it does come apart

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.490 
many many times it does come apart
easily
