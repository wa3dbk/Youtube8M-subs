great thing was is that they accepted
the<00:01:07.890> challenge<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.520> embraced<00:01:08.910> these

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the challenge they embraced these

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
embracing constraints they didn't say

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.940 
embracing constraints they didn't say
okay<00:01:14.880> three<00:01:15.180> minutes<00:01:15.480> ago<00:01:15.690> we<00:01:15.870> need<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.260> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
okay three minutes ago we need more and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
okay three minutes ago we need more and
so<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.340> said<00:01:17.520> well<00:01:17.550> make<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.120> happening

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
you know like a five-minute presentation

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.859 
you know like a five-minute presentation
so

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
so

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.050 
so
the<00:01:23.560> first<00:01:23.799> genocide<00:01:24.159> case<00:01:24.430> was<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.700> had<00:01:24.939> to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
the first genocide case was I had to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.580 
the first genocide case was I had to
come<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.509> container<00:01:25.899> design<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
come up with the container design and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.920 
come up with the container design and
the<00:01:26.649> container<00:01:27.040> had<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.399> actually<00:01:27.579> both<00:01:28.360> hold

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
the container had to actually both hold

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.870 
the container had to actually both hold
finally<00:01:29.380> water<00:01:29.590> cook<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.070> food<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.490> actually

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
finally water cook the food can actually

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460 
finally water cook the food can actually
be<00:01:31.030> something<00:01:31.299> that<00:01:31.509> people<00:01:31.659> can<00:01:31.930> carry<00:01:32.229> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
be something that people can carry the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.859 
be something that people can carry the
news<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.490> how<00:01:33.610> do<00:01:33.670> they<00:01:33.880> do<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.119> well<00:01:34.780> they

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
news so how do they do that well they

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.719 
news so how do they do that well they
came<00:01:35.049> up<00:01:35.259> with<00:01:35.289> thousands<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.369> containers

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
came up with thousands of containers

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.880 
came up with thousands of containers
with<00:01:37.180> lots<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.600> different<00:01:37.930> materials<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
with lots of different materials and

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.169 
with lots of different materials and
then<00:01:39.009> would<00:01:39.159> do<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:39.399> iterative<00:01:39.939> design

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
then would do this iterative design

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.820 
then would do this iterative design
process<00:01:40.330> right<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.470> love<00:01:41.649> this

of ideas like this trial and error
process<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.929> what<00:01:47.289> comes<00:01:47.470> out<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.829> and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
process and what comes out of that and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.800 
process and what comes out of that and
that's<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> way<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.549> really<00:01:48.700> great<00:01:49.179> great

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
that's the way to really great great

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.929 
that's the way to really great great
great<00:01:50.079> products<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:51.399> in<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> end<00:01:51.789> they

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
great products and in the end they

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.490 
great products and in the end they
actually<00:01:52.299> did<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.750> took<00:01:52.899> several<00:01:53.140> months

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
actually did this it took several months

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.930 
actually did this it took several months
but<00:01:53.590> they<00:01:53.710> actually<00:01:53.890> created<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.549> container

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
but they actually created a container

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.639 
but they actually created a container
they<00:01:55.209> now<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:55.869> don't<00:01:56.110> think<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.560> as

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
they now we don't think of it as

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.460 
they now we don't think of it as
revolutionary<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:57.490> at<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.700> time<00:01:58.000> was<00:01:58.470> there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
revolutionary but at the time was there

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.499 
revolutionary but at the time was there
he<00:01:59.740> was<00:01:59.830> new<00:02:00.039> material<00:02:00.610> never<00:02:01.119> been<00:02:01.330> used

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
he was new material never been used

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.570 
he was new material never been used
before<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.110> way<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.220> was<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
before in this way and that was just the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.639 
before in this way and that was just the
first<00:02:03.819> challenge<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.659> second<00:02:05.200> challenge<00:02:05.530> was

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
first challenge the second challenge was

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.339 
first challenge the second challenge was
the<00:02:06.130> president<00:02:06.700> said<00:02:06.850> at<00:02:07.270> work<00:02:07.479> toppings<00:02:08.049> I

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
the president said at work toppings I

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.800 
the president said at work toppings I
want<00:02:09.069> eaten<00:02:09.429> vegetables<00:02:09.610> maybe<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.569> can<00:02:10.720> cook

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
want eaten vegetables maybe you can cook

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.780 
want eaten vegetables maybe you can cook
in<00:02:10.989> three<00:02:11.170> minutes<00:02:11.349> as<00:02:11.590> well<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.400> none<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
in three minutes as well and none of the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.759 
in three minutes as well and none of the
food<00:02:13.030> drive<00:02:13.239> techniques<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.989> time<00:02:14.200> were

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
food drive techniques at the time were

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.920 
food drive techniques at the time were
able<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:16.090> how<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.330> they<00:02:16.540> solve<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
able to do this so how do they solve the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.949 
able to do this so how do they solve the
problem<00:02:17.319> well<00:02:18.069> they<00:02:18.549> used<00:02:19.140> freeze-dried

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
problem well they used freeze-dried

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
problem well they used freeze-dried
because<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:24.280> even<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
because here it is like even the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.610 
because here it is like even the

this is the red shrimp I've been looking
for<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:09.670> already<00:03:09.940> decided<00:03:10.569> on<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
container and the noodles were either

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.240 
container and the noodles were either
frying<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.109> outside<00:03:14.500> part<00:03:14.739> or<00:03:15.040> what

cooking<00:03:15.489> all<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.790> way<00:03:16.000> through<00:03:16.329> they<00:03:16.810> had<00:03:16.930> to

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
cooking all the way through they had to

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.199 
cooking all the way through they had to
figure<00:03:17.170> out<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.409> way<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.590> address<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
figure out a way to address that and the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.059 
figure out a way to address that and the
way<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.480> transit<00:03:19.780> actually<00:03:20.230> was<00:03:20.440> turned<00:03:21.010> out

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
way that transit actually was turned out

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.339 
way that transit actually was turned out
to<00:03:21.220> be<00:03:21.310> really<00:03:21.609> simple<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.049> thing<00:03:23.200> did

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
to be really simple and one thing did

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.229 
to be really simple and one thing did
was<00:03:23.530> they<00:03:23.680> reduce<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.340> number<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.670> noodles<00:03:25.090> in

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
was they reduce the number of noodles in

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.970 
was they reduce the number of noodles in
the<00:03:25.329> container<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:26.200> actually<00:03:26.560> put<00:03:26.859> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
the container they actually put the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.500 
the container they actually put the
noodles<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.609> they<00:03:27.760> attached<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
noodles so that they attached to the
