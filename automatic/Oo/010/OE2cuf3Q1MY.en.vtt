00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 nice guys here a new video of cifa 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.410
 it with me that I am therefore I introduce myself 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.690
 I will be making this 20th edition to my series 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.359
 first of all they started from the game 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.269
 game had begun to see only goals 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 because anyway there are enough 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.529
 both too much and presentation has 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 already known all so I can only 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 tell you that I had made a match one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.070
 alone in the head-to-head version 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.700
 sneak preview where it then 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 one and for that thing he lost in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 this episode liked games won 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.789
 both the solidario we will also see 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 how can we say then do 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.250
 a scale type series between series a series 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 division 1 actually in home software 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 our friend said it a series and it is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.189
 practically with this climb to the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 division 1 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.750
 I will try to get to the uniform 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.799
 head to head in the season at the head of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 head 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.360
 and then I don't know, however, a hat I will make you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 maybe all the games because they are 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.979
 really many to get to imitate 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 euros are an incredible thing they are 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 lots of games and it would take 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.770
 months that follow us every month 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.189
 but provide perhaps more matches 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.409
 beautiful both the most beautiful victories and the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.390
 uglier defeats 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.329
 maybe if I take place at 0 I do it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 see or maybe dinner draws 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.009
 party that still fought things over 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.350
 similar and in the first game sucupira 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.329
 hide lose first lady or all 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.030
 two good good goals a good one 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.759
 level 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.090
 and I speak for a moment of what I will do 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 of the eros series that I will do on this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.290
 channel 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 I am planning this series with note 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.910
 then a practically a series set 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 mild advice to the king of the unpublished and from 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.340
 to do today I will do the same ie it depends 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 depends on the times sometimes I will take 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.300
 maybe our advice if there was 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.890
 someone that interests me is that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.090
 obviously I'm writing in the comments 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.280
 obvious and I will take your advice 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.100
 or some idea of mine I have some ideas 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.750
 of someone at random and I will create the 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:52.410
 team from all over the world but about 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.420
 About 600,000, however, preference 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.410
 at the beginning to your player like 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 rooney as in nature and that as the plan 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.959
 pards like the cube don't even come to me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.280
 in mind xabi alonso it is however of 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.280
 lose it really go a lot 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.320
 that's pretty much so if you want jazz 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.000
 start sending to write a team 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.610
 what time are you seeing on some teams 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.830
 do it sharp top in your budget not 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.380
 you can tell of facebook if gross for that 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.540
 put I can not take it because ne 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.110
 costs too much 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.330
 can you tell me hybrid paintings that just for 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.180
 who did not know the mixed leagues of 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.920
 nationality what kind of teams in 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.630
 a simple league of rationality 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.989
 what you want team of 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.060
 any kind just inside the limit 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.880
 and then of course I will make a team for 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.090
 I will build it also making you see the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.120
 stunt where you buy players and so on 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.920
 and then I go online with mental or maybe 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.420
 in 23 games and niguarda 52 games 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.380
 I make a goal compilation of maybe in 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.209
 minute no coincidence no beautiful goals at random 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.390
 just to show how one turns 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.730
 team let's say 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.410
 I will also do scud builder ie with 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.320
 prodigy for building teams 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.880
 always live always showing 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.970
 how come i make the choices that faces 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.860
 we also said spouses builder for you 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.500
 that is, it could be maybe I don't know but 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.200
 serious from 5 some with a budget of 50 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.880
 credits a barclays with a budget of 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.900
 100 thousand all such things 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.090
 according to my taste second point 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.360
 that you can therefore I will obviously help 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.950
 also accuracy authors especially you 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.270
 then a last series I could not do 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.150
 I'm still one hundred percent sure 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.720
 tell me why if you said you told me 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.180
 that could interest you or that you 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.740
 incredibly interested in what 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.000
 genus I obviously do it is the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.990
 series d 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.690
 the virtual players say online 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.860
 though with shopping either 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.900
 sincerely or the season that is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.180
 what happened is called becomes 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.220
 a myth which I honestly don't know how 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:18.570
 they were called blue and obviously in 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.770
 first team and surnames oh that will be a 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.560
 65 something like that I do in the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:30.440
 career until helped to arrive 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.450
 people from barcelona are split 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.840
 and this, however, was only a brief one 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.020
 presentation video facts 9 shortly 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.990
 the fesa followed and half you have to tell me 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.290
 also everything in the comments of the trash art 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.840
 you must also tell me if you want 4 videos 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.669
 video minutes of six minutes ten minutes 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.530
 20 minute video 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.220
 some 20 minutes maybe first please 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.480
 because as in pages of 20 minutes no 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.250
 but for example to me a video of 4 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.169
 minutes on the otherwise maybe some 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.100
 a few wallpapers like this 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.450
 short at least you don't get bored watching it 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.980
 that would be fine by me 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.000
 tell me of course you are the one who 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.700
 you have to let me know where everything was yesterday 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.389
 as much as you can see with this 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.550
 green problem is really rolling 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:27.630
 I could say even if it's not a word 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:31.389
 that this is often enough 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:34.510
 this I am zumpa and we missed the 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:37.139
 your video as long as it's a race video 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.139
