00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.739
 game comes out is going to be not long but 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.199
 has accused great controversy because it has 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.140
 The truth of the games has been very good 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.330
 ubisoft are very good but good we go 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.739
 to start with what is the tutorial and 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.129
 they know how are my videos I'm going to 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.020
 ask that they have downloaded installed 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.149
 the programs that we are going to need are 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.040
 Mandatory people are required 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.780
 because if not we can not download 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.770
 install the game ok 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.260
 good the programs that we are going to 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.930
 need be the torrent look the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.460
 torrent and the program damon tours Nomás 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.530
 those two programs installed in your 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.489
 computer and the links will be in the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.790
 video description 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.049
 and they do not have to do anything smarter 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.610
 now assuming they have the 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.450
 installed programs let's start 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.289
 with the video 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.370
 we are going to download a torrent that is not 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.970
 will leave them in the description of the video 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.390
 on the ground I think I have it because 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.610
 part of the text is this cast of 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.980
 VICTOR but the only thing they have to do 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 is to download it and win double click 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:41.020
 we will leave this that is the author program 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.050
 and the mozart ok we weigh in total 17 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.970
 gigas is not much is not much since 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.190
 Victor Bullets is tower packs so that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.470
 be as compressed as possible and not 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.130
 they weigh too good before we give 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 ok and the file will be put here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.260
 ready and will put us here as you can see 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.670
 that is another example of another game but 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.130
 well suppose that this is the far cry 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.770
 3 and when you have finished all this 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.750
 bar that has been spent then we are going to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.510
 give it here right click open folder 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.580
 Container will open the folder 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.130
 where is the game in my case is in 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.350
 downloads and finish say part wright 3 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.510
 we will have all these files as 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.610
 can see are rar file what we're going 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.460
 to do is give it right click extract 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.200
 here 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.690
 for people who do not get this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.100
 icon because there are people who do not have 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.660
 installed the program if you do not get them 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.150
 this icon as in the books is because 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.680
 they do not have windows installed but so 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.410
 general all computers have it 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.500
 ready then let's go to the folder goes to 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 park there are 3 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.750
 we will have two folders that is dvd 1 and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.620
 the dvd 2 what we are going to do now is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.960
 assuming they have installed the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.420
 damon tools program and previously the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.050
 so let's double click on 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.240
 this double click immediately we were 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.190
 will open a window 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.530
 and once here we are assembling image as 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.510
 can see on the screen is the beta that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.880
 is the window that I was referring to let's give 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:15.060
 in executing author a by víctor for 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.910
 now this window does not jump that is the the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.760
 said up or whatever you want to call it and what 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.060
 we will give you is to install we are going to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.770
 install smart people I do not give you because 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.430
 I have the game installed 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.440
 but you will leave them there the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 sedative installation what they have to 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.460
 do is give you following next 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.190
 Julián the option that says create an icon 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.440
 on the desk and next ready already 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.260
 when the installation goes in half 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.450
 care people care people go for the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 half what you have to do is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.920
 go to the folder that is giving alt and 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.560
 tabulate so this will come out and not 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.860
 close the installation and they will go to the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.230
 game folder 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.330
 Y 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.780
 must two have to go to the folder of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.610

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.560
 double click will tell you again riding 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.480
 image will come a window to 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.629
 then this has to close 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.540
 that this is closed and now and well 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.870
 they come back again with the lat the alt and the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.889
 tabulation they're going to look for the one given and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.380
 all you have to do is give it ok

 ok is the continuous installation 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.400
 Following is because they did well done 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.380
 already when the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.500

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.880
