I'm<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> make<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.720> I'll<00:01:12.720> calculator

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I'm going to make but I'll calculator

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
I'm going to make but I'll calculator
net<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.799> I'll<00:01:14.010> calculate<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.850> man<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
net and I'll calculate it man put it in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:26.910 
net and I'll calculate it man put it in
the<00:01:16.380> title<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:18.150> video<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.509> well

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.280 

no<00:01:27.920> I'm<00:01:28.400> guessing<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.270> inventory<00:01:29.990> takes

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
no I'm guessing and inventory takes

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.260 
no I'm guessing and inventory takes
about<00:01:30.590> 30<00:01:31.010> seconds<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.550> do<00:01:31.760> so<00:01:31.940> that's<00:01:32.150> about

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
about 30 seconds to do so that's about

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.310 
about 30 seconds to do so that's about
do<00:01:32.659> inventories<00:01:33.380> per<00:01:33.590> minute<00:01:35.020> which<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.140> not

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
do inventories per minute which is not

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420 
do inventories per minute which is not
that<00:01:36.500> bad<00:01:36.710> at<00:01:36.890> all<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:38.380> if<00:01:39.380> these<00:01:39.680> actually

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
that bad at all and if these actually

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.050 
that bad at all and if these actually
managed<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:40.940> sell<00:01:41.630> at<00:01:41.960> market<00:01:42.229> price<00:01:42.830> oh<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
managed to sell at market price oh and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.859 
managed to sell at market price oh and
they<00:01:47.210> do<00:01:51.670> just<00:01:52.670> made<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.560> approximately<00:01:55.869> three

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
they do just made a approximately three

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.270 
they do just made a approximately three
yeah<00:01:58.060> 3500<00:01:59.060> profit<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.600> two<00:01:59.899> minutes<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:00.619> i'll

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
yeah 3500 profit in two minutes so i'll

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.670 
yeah 3500 profit in two minutes so i'll
actually<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.729> calculate<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.240> right<00:02:02.450> now

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
actually just calculate that right now

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.719 
actually just calculate that right now
are<00:02:03.680> no<00:02:05.619> 3500<00:02:06.619> minute<00:02:06.860> no<00:02:07.660> dammit<00:02:08.800> brain<00:02:09.800> fart

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
are no 3500 minute no dammit brain fart

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.280 
are no 3500 minute no dammit brain fart
whatever<00:02:15.250> 3500<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.519> 30<00:02:17.510> seconds<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.110> that's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
whatever 3500 in 30 seconds so that's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280 
whatever 3500 in 30 seconds so that's
seven<00:02:18.680> thousand<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.610> minute<00:02:20.000> time's<00:02:20.750> up<00:02:21.050> by

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
seven thousand in a minute time's up by

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.440 
seven thousand in a minute time's up by
60<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.090> about<00:02:23.560> 420<00:02:24.560> k<00:02:24.769> an<00:02:24.950> hour<00:02:25.450> not

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
60 so that is about 420 k an hour not

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.509 
60 so that is about 420 k an hour not
bad<00:02:26.720> considering<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.470> has<00:02:27.620> no<00:02:27.829> requirements
