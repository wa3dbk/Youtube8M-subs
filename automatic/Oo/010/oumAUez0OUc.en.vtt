00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
wide-angle lens

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.670 
wide-angle lens
okay<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:56.299> wide-angle<00:00:56.989> if<00:00:57.049> you<00:00:57.170> extend<00:00:57.530> that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
okay so wide-angle if you extend that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.500 
okay so wide-angle if you extend that
all<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.010> way<00:00:58.100> you're<00:00:58.250> gonna<00:00:58.339> see<00:00:58.699> that<00:00:59.239> there

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
are some black around the edges so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.190 
are some black around the edges so
that's<00:01:01.850> not<00:01:02.920> not<00:01:03.920> ideal<00:01:04.630> you<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:05.750> bring<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.080> in

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
okay now we've got the two points who

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.249 
okay now we've got the two points who
telephoto<00:01:22.460> converter<00:01:22.880> you'll<00:01:23.780> notice<00:01:24.049> once

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
telephoto converter you'll notice once

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.649

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.480 
again you've got the dark halo around
the<00:01:26.840> outside<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.229> that's<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
the outside just that's just the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.399 
the outside just that's just the
extension<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.240> lens<00:01:29.450> if<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:30.409> bring<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.829> in

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
extension of the lens if you bring it in

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.660 
extension of the lens if you bring it in
you<00:01:33.409> know<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:33.770> rid<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.189> lens<00:01:34.460> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
you know you get rid of that lens and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.130 
you know you get rid of that lens and
obviously<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:35.539> televoting<00:01:35.929> you're

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
obviously because it's televoting you're

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.980 
obviously because it's televoting you're
gonna<00:01:36.259> bring<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.679> in<00:01:36.829> anyway<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.960> know

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
gonna bring it in anyway and you know

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.950 
gonna bring it in anyway and you know
not<00:01:39.259> too<00:01:39.470> bad<00:01:39.649> considering<00:01:40.539> considering<00:01:41.539> it's

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
not too bad considering considering it's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.249 
not too bad considering considering it's
not<00:01:42.140> actually<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> lenses<00:01:42.979> -<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> converter

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
not actually a lenses - it's a converter

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.960 
not actually a lenses - it's a converter
but<00:01:45.259> you'll<00:01:45.770> see<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.310> you're<00:01:46.610> still<00:01:46.850> getting

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
but you'll see it's you're still getting

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.760 
but you'll see it's you're still getting
some<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:49.610> may<00:01:49.759> not<00:01:49.909> be<00:01:50.030> spectacular<00:01:50.770> but

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
some it may not be spectacular but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.130 
some it may not be spectacular but
you've<00:01:52.189> got<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> little<00:01:52.700> bit<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.659> little<00:01:54.020> bit

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
you've got a little bit of a little bit

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.450 
you've got a little bit of a little bit
more<00:01:55.030> distance<00:01:56.030> than<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.179> had<00:01:56.420> before
