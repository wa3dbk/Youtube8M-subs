00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 molecular gastronomy was 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.940
 the end of the 1980s in the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.230
 university of oxford in england and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 Welsh science that studies phenomena 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 chemical and physical properties of the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.530
 food and once a month we will bring 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 here some of the techniques of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 molecular cooking to make some 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 very easy simple recipes that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 can be played there in your kitchen 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.859
 and today we are going to do a wonderful 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.260
 Honey cake the chocolate nuts using the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.990
 gfk technique is that it is one of those 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.759
 basic techniques of molecular cooking 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:42.480
 people already used here on the channel 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:43.800
 To make that fake pasta for 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 make a recipe today we will go 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
 need only one mobile 75 ml 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 spoon of hiv that that gelatin of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 seaweed that you find in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.500
 oriental products is well cheap 40 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.829
 grams of nuts two balls of minced 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 milk chocolate 40 ml of water also 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.789
 known as it ended up isolated first 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.390
 then step will be to mix the honey 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 Water 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 slow and carry the fire was boiling 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 stirring to dissolve therein and then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 people waiting the mix is a little bit 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 and will throw a plate to make a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.340
 very shallow crust 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.619
 Anyway, we can take this mixture to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.299
 refrigerator for 15 minutes and then it is only 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.299
 take out the refrigerator and cut into 5 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.189
 and then we 'll prepare the filling 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.170
 chocolate shavings to the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.159
 milk a little bit to our new 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 applied 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.780
 Just fold it and you're ready to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.490
 To make sure we ended up leaving a 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 week in the refrigerator honey business and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.009
 AndrÃ© will be very firm. 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.570
 Actually, we could not 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.580
 finish recording a video on the same day 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
 so it was not until later 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.909
 and now is the time so long awaited 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 so I'm ready here our 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.030
 molecular pastels we'll prove it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.369
 now to see what it feels like to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.420
 eat this technological combination and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.399
 scientific 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.690
 I prefer the likely I like 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:16.739
 mint prickly pear 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:19.010
 Battalion is the last document will carol 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.010
 pro 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.620
 It was very good because honey and walnuts 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.379
 played they match the taste very well 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.260
 so do not stay active is a good thing 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.910
 different even gets very tasty 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.880
 then okay I do not like too but 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.349
 I found it delicious 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.970
 So that was the recipe today lets the 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.099
 joinha if you like the video if you 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.480
 is not subscribed to pro channel sign up 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.739
 Do not forget to share the video. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.239
 also with their friends so that they 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.030
 can make these experiences 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.890
 cooking in their kitchen and comment 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 also because it makes comment 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.220
 we see in the next video a 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.220
 big hug and see you 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.930
 and it is the science that surrounds it and it is the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.930
 science that involves the study 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:24.900
 and it is the science that studies the studies 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:30.030
 that it is science that studies the obvious 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.389
 to study science that studies them and it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.620
 is the science that studies the phenomena and 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:41.359
 it and it is the science that studies and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 efficiency and it is the science that 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.930
 by the science that studies the phenomena 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500
 chemical and physical properties of the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500
 food
