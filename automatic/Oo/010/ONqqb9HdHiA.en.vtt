00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
yes I know it looks nasty but guess what

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.529 
yes I know it looks nasty but guess what
I<00:01:49.450> don't<00:01:49.660> have<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:50.340> million<00:01:51.340> dollars<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.880> go<00:01:52.000> run

I don't have a million dollars to go run

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.700 
I don't have a million dollars to go run
it<00:01:52.690> through<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.020> ceiling<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.750> mounts<00:01:56.619> I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
it through the ceiling the mounts I

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.920 
it through the ceiling the mounts I
actually<00:01:56.890> made<00:01:57.220> myself<00:01:57.399> they're<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.210> sheet

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
actually made myself they're just sheet

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.529 
actually made myself they're just sheet
metal<00:01:59.229> glued<00:01:59.440> together<00:01:59.619> and<00:02:00.030> yes<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.180> did<00:02:01.360> say

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
metal glued together and yes I did say

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.810 
metal glued together and yes I did say
glued<00:02:01.899> because<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.649> don't<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> TIG<00:02:03.789> welder

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
glued because I don't have a TIG welder

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.710 
glued because I don't have a TIG welder
so<00:02:05.220> they<00:02:06.220> have<00:02:06.399> yet<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.670> fall<00:02:07.000> down<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.390> my<00:02:07.509> head

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
so they have yet to fall down on my head

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.260 
so they have yet to fall down on my head
because<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.590> would<00:02:09.280> really<00:02:09.580> suck<00:02:10.030> these

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
because that would really suck these

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.320 
because that would really suck these
things<00:02:10.539> weigh<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> ton<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.650> how<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.060> for

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
things weigh a ton for how you know for

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.350 
things weigh a ton for how you know for
how<00:02:13.420> small<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:14.019> are<00:02:14.700> give<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.730> an<00:02:15.940> idea<00:02:16.269> of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
how small they are give you an idea of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.850 
how small they are give you an idea of
how<00:02:16.570> how<00:02:17.110> large<00:02:17.380> they<00:02:17.680> are

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
how how large they are

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.220 
how how large they are
and<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.900> usually<00:02:20.260> run<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:22.000> 5<00:02:22.360> channel<00:02:22.870> audio

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
and I usually run it in 5 channel audio

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.590 
and I usually run it in 5 channel audio
because<00:02:23.700> what's<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> point<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.360> can't

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
because what's the point that you can't

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.949 
because what's the point that you can't
run<00:02:25.870> surround<00:02:26.350> sound<00:02:27.390> can't<00:02:28.390> exactly<00:02:28.660> run

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
run surround sound can't exactly run

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.840 
run surround sound can't exactly run
surround<00:02:29.380> sound<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.840> stereo<00:02:31.840> music

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
surround sound with your stereo music

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.240 
surround sound with your stereo music
kind<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.940> pointless<00:02:34.239> now<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:35.829> connect<00:02:36.130> all

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
kind of pointless now to connect all

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.380 
kind of pointless now to connect all
this<00:02:36.400> together<00:02:36.579> I've<00:02:37.450> got<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.260> Belkin<00:02:39.390> mini
