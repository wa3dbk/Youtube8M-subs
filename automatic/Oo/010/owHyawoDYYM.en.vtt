the note and I'm putting my hand is
close<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> bridge<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> now

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
close to the bridge as I can get it now

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690 
close to the bridge as I can get it now
you'll<00:01:06.960> notice<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.530> happens<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> were<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you'll notice what happens if I were to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.870 
you'll notice what happens if I were to
move<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.120> hand<00:01:09.330> closer<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> sound<00:01:10.260> hole

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.360 

the<00:01:14.880> muting<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> note<00:01:16.020> goes<00:01:16.260> away<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
the muting the note goes away so you

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.250 
the muting the note goes away so you
have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:17.940> sure<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:18.510> it<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:18.870> and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
get it closer to the to the bridge on

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.120 
get it closer to the to the bridge on
the<00:01:21.420> guitar<00:01:21.750> obviously<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:23.100> doing

applies you need to keep it kind of
closer<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.220> bridge<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.640> guitar<00:01:31.310> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
closer to the bridge of the guitar to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
closer to the bridge of the guitar to
get<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> effect<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.590> play

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
what that was but that would sound

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.880 
what that was but that would sound
pretty<00:02:03.509> cool<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.869> had<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> delay<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.859> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
pretty cool if you had a delay on it
