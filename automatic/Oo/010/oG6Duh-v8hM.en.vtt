00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.019
 welcome to a new video this time 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.579
 I'm going to make a different video and I'm going 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.650
 to explain how to make a hairstyle 

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:11.690
 pretty simple but that I like 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.999
 I quite saw it the other day seeing photos 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.410
 portable and I decided to do it so in 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.900
 this video we will explain how 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.760
 It looks like a very hairstyle 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.740
 easy to do but at the same time fix 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 enough and so you can change a bit of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.720
 look to make this hairstyle 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.590
 We need two gums hair several 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.840
 hairpins a comb 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.360
 and a hair iron 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.570
 to start we will leave the part of the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.720
 bangs forward and we 'll make 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.739
 the stripe in the middle dividing our hair 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.739
 in two parts 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.800
 once this is done we will make a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.310
 braid on each side 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.760
 and you 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.760
 ah 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.800
 i 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.200
 no no 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.930
 ah 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.120
 to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.390
 no no no 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.710
 and not 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890
 yes 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.509
 when we have finished braids 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.189
 we will start with this for example the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.040
 we will take in this way what you are 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.580
 watching and we will go as if it were 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 a headband 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.570
 in this way 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.210
 so 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 when we get to the other end 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.780
 we will try to hide it between the hair and 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.240
 grab it with a fork after you 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.680
 we can put another fork or even 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.680
 two so that it holds well 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.670
 and we will do the same with the other braid the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.320
 we went in this way from one side towards 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.320
 the other as if it were a diadem 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.220
 and we try to hide behind 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.730
 the other one and we hooked it with a couple of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.730
 Forks 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.130
 hide well the forks that are not 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 see 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.920
 now we will take the hair iron and what 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.120
 What we will do is shape our 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.819
 fringe 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.269
 I did it this way by making myself 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.269
 like some ripples on each side 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420
 ah 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.069
 and finally, it is only necessary to touch up a little 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.849
 for example to put the camera that does not 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.849
 about the bangs 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.129
 As you can see it is a very easy hairstyle and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.810
 Well I hope you liked it and if 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.150
