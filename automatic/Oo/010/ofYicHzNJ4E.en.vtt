00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 I do not know if it has happened to you that 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.160
 sometimes try to open a file and what 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.379
 associate with a program and open it and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 then I do not know what you can 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.520
 this is a file cel 32 points of l the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.760
 that I have associated with a program 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 called restore edited and to power them 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 associate what we should do is go to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 start button if you already have it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.600
 have or if we do not open our 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 explorer that in this case the tutorial 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.760
 it's special for windows 8 we 're going to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.760
 team and we look for the bold bold 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.640
 and we go to see and we go in 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.940
 file name extensions 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.900
 we mark this box we close and we create 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.000
 a text file called that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 association or as you want 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.900
 put the name does not matter 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 and here where it says txt point we put it 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 enter and we give in itself 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.549
