guy and if you don't have a power pack

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
guy and if you don't have a power pack
for<00:00:44.340> both<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.750> only<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
for both of them well not only one of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
for both of them well not only one of
them<00:00:46.350> works<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.489> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> defeats<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
them works and then kind of defeats the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.360 
them works and then kind of defeats the
whole<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:49.489> exactly<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.860> power

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
whole point exactly so we have a power

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
whole point exactly so we have a power
plug<00:00:53.699> power<00:00:54.480> plug<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> frame<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:55.620> there

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
plug power plug in the frame okay there

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
plug power plug in the frame okay there
we<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:56.149> that<00:00:57.149> goes<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:59.000> just<00:01:00.000> Sega<00:01:00.239> CD

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
we go that goes in here just Sega CD

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
we go that goes in here just Sega CD
now<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.879> over

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
now we have another one and it's over

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
now we have another one and it's over
here<00:01:03.409> power<00:01:04.409> plug<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> black<00:01:05.460> end

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
here power plug again it's the black end

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
here power plug again it's the black end
there's<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:07.049> different<00:01:07.170> voltages<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
there's actually different voltages to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.580 
there's actually different voltages to
them<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> voltages<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> jump<00:01:10.439> down

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
them it has a voltages and jump down

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.560 
them it has a voltages and jump down
there<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.610> labeled<00:01:12.510> mine<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:13.290> witches<00:01:13.560> which

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
there I labeled mine for witches which

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
there I labeled mine for witches which
really<00:01:15.570> doesn't<00:01:16.049> matter<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.520> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
really doesn't matter but I don't really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
really doesn't matter but I don't really
want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.030> new<00:01:18.180> capacitors<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.470> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
want to put new capacitors in so I do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.010 
want to put new capacitors in so I do
that<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.430> okay

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
that it's okay

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
that it's okay
Sega<00:01:22.049> plugging<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> okay<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.670> probably

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Sega plugging in okay now probably

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
Sega plugging in okay now probably
wondering<00:01:24.810> why<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.140> an<00:01:25.259> audio/video

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
wondering why I have an audio/video

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
wondering why I have an audio/video
cable<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> right

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
cable there well it's kind of right

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.649 
cable there well it's kind of right
there<00:01:27.659> touching<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.920> plugs<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.400> here

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
there touching it this plugs in here

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.859 
there touching it this plugs in here
this<00:01:30.659> gets<00:01:31.850> actually<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.180> audio<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.659> think

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this gets actually so just audio I think

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.679 
this gets actually so just audio I think
it's<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> right<00:01:34.320> left<00:01:34.619> stereo<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> CD

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it's the right left stereo out of the CD

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's the right left stereo out of the CD
because<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:38.820> could<00:01:38.970> play<00:01:39.119> music

have a thinner cable like the original

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.029 
have a thinner cable like the original
one<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.030> us<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.900> actually<00:05:23.199> fits<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.889> that

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
one to us it actually fits in that

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.399 
one to us it actually fits in that
little<00:05:24.580> slot<00:05:25.180> right<00:05:25.240> there<00:05:25.449> but<00:05:26.080> that's<00:05:26.229> what

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
little slot right there but that's what

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.110 
little slot right there but that's what
that's<00:05:26.560> for<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:27.310> doesn't<00:05:27.550> do<00:05:27.610> anything<00:05:27.819> like

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
that's for it doesn't do anything like

that's for it doesn't do anything like
you<00:05:28.389> know<00:05:28.509> it's<00:05:29.199> not<00:05:29.319> a<00:05:29.380> combat<00:05:29.830> speed<00:05:30.130> button

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
you know it's not a combat speed button

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.409 
you know it's not a combat speed button
or<00:05:30.759> or<00:05:31.479> it<00:05:31.779> makes<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.050> CD<00:05:32.319> spin<00:05:32.529> faster<00:05:33.009> or
