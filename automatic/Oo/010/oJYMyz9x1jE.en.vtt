delay<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.690> feel<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> delay<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.500> really

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
delay on here I feel the delay is really

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
delay on here I feel the delay is really
crucial<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> lead<00:01:02.760> part<00:01:03.030> stick<00:01:03.359> out

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
crucial to make this lead part stick out

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
crucial to make this lead part stick out
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> dotted<00:01:04.350> eighth<00:01:04.470> delay<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.010> tapped<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's a dotted eighth delay we tapped it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
it's a dotted eighth delay we tapped it
in<00:01:05.610> exactly<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> BPM<00:01:06.960> BPM<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.040> at

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
in exactly with the BPM BPM is right at

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.929 
in exactly with the BPM BPM is right at
75<00:01:08.810> BPM<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> I'm

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
75 BPM so what we're going to do is I'm

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.550 
75 BPM so what we're going to do is I'm
gonna<00:01:12.090> play<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:13.350> B<00:01:13.500> major<00:01:13.710> scale<00:01:13.830> real<00:01:14.159> quick

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.410 

knows<00:01:17.950> there's<00:01:18.189> some<00:01:18.310> delay<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:18.729> there<00:01:18.970> so

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
knows there's some delay on there so

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.359 
knows there's some delay on there so
we're<00:01:19.540> using<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.810> really<00:01:20.020> easy<00:01:20.409> shape<00:01:20.799> here<00:01:21.070> you

first three fingers we're going to need
our<00:01:25.810> pinky<00:01:26.289> for<00:01:26.470> something<00:01:26.799> else<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:28.149> this<00:01:28.299> is

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
our pinky for something else so this is

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.969 
our pinky for something else so this is
coming<00:01:28.570> right<00:01:28.840> out<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.049> your<00:01:29.200> B<00:01:29.350> major<00:01:29.560> scale

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
coming right out of your B major scale

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.490 
coming right out of your B major scale
on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.159> D<00:01:30.430> string<00:01:30.539> from<00:01:31.539> the<00:01:31.630> ninth<00:01:31.899> fret<00:01:32.170> on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
on the D string from the ninth fret on

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.070 
on the D string from the ninth fret on
the<00:01:32.590> g<00:01:33.070> string<00:01:33.100> we're<00:01:33.820> on<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.360> eighth<00:01:34.509> fret<00:01:34.780> on

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
the g string we're on the eighth fret on

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.260 
the g string we're on the eighth fret on
the<00:01:35.170> B<00:01:35.470> string<00:01:35.679> we're<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.670> seventh<00:01:37.060> fret

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
and so with this dotted eighth delay

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.350 
and so with this dotted eighth delay
it's<00:01:39.340> going<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> pick<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:39.939> out<00:01:40.030> it's<00:01:40.179> going<00:01:40.240> to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
it's going to pick it out it's going to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.450 
last part of the C major scale we use
this<00:05:41.300> key<00:05:41.660> right<00:05:41.960> here<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.770> we<00:05:42.860> use<00:05:43.010> this<00:05:43.190> key

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
this key right here and we use this key

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.610 
this key right here and we use this key
right<00:05:43.730> here<00:05:43.970> as<00:05:44.120> well<00:05:44.420> that's<00:05:44.930> all<00:05:45.140> we<00:05:45.290> reach<00:05:45.500> a

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
right here as well that's all we reach a

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.620 
right here as well that's all we reach a
little<00:05:45.800> extra<00:05:46.310> outside<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.300> what<00:05:47.420> we<00:05:47.510> have

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
little extra outside of what we have

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.930 
little extra outside of what we have
already<00:05:47.870> talked<00:05:48.080> about<00:05:48.200> but<00:05:49.040> this<00:05:49.520> allows<00:05:49.760> you

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
already talked about but this allows you

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.970 
already talked about but this allows you
to<00:05:50.030> stay<00:05:50.240> still<00:05:50.570> sounds<00:05:51.200> really<00:05:51.500> great<00:05:51.740> and

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
to stay still sounds really great and

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.830 
to stay still sounds really great and
the<00:05:52.370> whole<00:05:52.550> point<00:05:52.970> of<00:05:53.060> this<00:05:53.270> right<00:05:53.450> here<00:05:53.660> is<00:05:53.750> to

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
the whole point of this right here is to

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
parts from these scales we taught

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.370 
parts from these scales we taught
sometimes<00:05:58.730> it's<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:58.970> chord<00:05:59.210> shape<00:05:59.480> like<00:06:00.230> an

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
sometimes it's a chord shape like an

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.040 
sometimes it's a chord shape like an
angel<00:06:00.680> armies<00:06:01.040> we<00:06:01.280> could<00:06:01.490> have<00:06:01.610> used<00:06:01.850> the

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
angel armies we could have used the

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.540 
angel armies we could have used the
Beijing<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.380> can<00:06:03.740> picked<00:06:03.920> it<00:06:04.010> out<00:06:04.130> a<00:06:04.160> little<00:06:04.340> bit

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
Beijing I can picked it out a little bit

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.670 
Beijing I can picked it out a little bit
as<00:06:04.670> well<00:06:04.910> and<00:06:05.180> it<00:06:05.600> kind<00:06:05.780> of<00:06:05.840> suspends<00:06:06.320> it<00:06:06.470> in<00:06:06.590> a

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
as well and it kind of suspends it in a

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.080 
as well and it kind of suspends it in a
way<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.920> resolves<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.520> and<00:06:07.610> that's<00:06:07.730> part<00:06:07.940> of

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
way it resolves it and that's part of

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.060
