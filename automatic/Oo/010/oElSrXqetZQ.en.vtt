00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
follow we still don't know whether

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.290 
follow we still don't know whether
that's<00:02:22.560> an<00:02:22.770> animatronic<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.060> know

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
whether that's actually purple man

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.510 
whether that's actually purple man
inside<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.120> purple<00:02:27.510> Freddy<00:02:27.690> costume<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:29.430> if

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
it was a costume this could make sense

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
what if they actually just used costumes

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
what if they actually just used costumes
like<00:02:47.550> purple<00:02:48.060> Freddy<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.959> used<00:02:49.260> as<00:02:49.500> a

what we haven't seen yet what if it's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.899 
what we haven't seen yet what if it's
just<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.319> completely<00:02:58.830> new<00:02:58.980> animatronic<00:02:59.730> what

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
know it's still a really big mystery but

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.500 
know it's still a really big mystery but
I<00:03:05.400> was<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.640> thinking<00:03:06.180> about<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
I was just thinking about the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.540 
I was just thinking about the
irrelevance<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.340> other

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
irrelevance to all the other

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.000 
irrelevance to all the other
animatronics<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.659> big<00:03:09.870> 1i<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.769> was

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
animatronics and the big 1i for of was

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.949 
animatronics and the big 1i for of was
purple<00:03:11.550> Freddy<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.750> different

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
purple Freddy because it's a different

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.500 
purple Freddy because it's a different
color<00:03:13.560> we've<00:03:14.280> seen<00:03:14.519> lots<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.269> five

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
color we've seen lots of it in five

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.330 
color we've seen lots of it in five

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you know it seems pretty important to me

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820 
you know it seems pretty important to me
and<00:03:24.209> what<00:03:24.390> all<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> costumes<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> think

and what all the costumes do you think
could<00:03:25.980> be<00:03:26.159> used<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.440> seen<00:03:28.709> any

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
could be used you know have we seen any

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.309 
could be used you know have we seen any
other<00:03:29.040> costumes<00:03:29.879> apparently<00:03:30.480> from<00:03:30.690> apart

possibly purple Freddy if you've got any

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.170 
possibly purple Freddy if you've got any
ideas<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.470> use<00:03:38.099> your<00:03:38.280> imagination<00:03:38.340> guys

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
ideas on what use your imagination guys

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.720 
ideas on what use your imagination guys
what<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.629> think<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.409> temporary<00:03:41.069> costumes

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
what do you think the temporary costumes

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.149 
what do you think the temporary costumes
mean<00:03:42.060> because<00:03:42.420> Scott<00:03:42.810> has<00:03:43.200> put<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
mean because Scott has put this in the

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.339 
mean because Scott has put this in the
phone<00:03:44.430> call<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.330> reason<00:03:45.840> he<00:03:45.930> wouldn't<00:03:46.200> talk

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
phone call for a reason he wouldn't talk

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.289 
phone call for a reason he wouldn't talk
about<00:03:46.409> temporary<00:03:47.099> costumes<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.849> irrelevance

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
about temporary costumes and irrelevance

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.539 
about temporary costumes and irrelevance
to<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.569> pizzeria<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:49.230> no<00:03:49.379> reason<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.400> could

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
to the pizzeria for no reason it could

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.670 
to the pizzeria for no reason it could
be<00:03:50.670> lots<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:51.090> things<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.959> personally<00:03:52.500> think

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
be lots of things but I personally think

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.350 
be lots of things but I personally think
it<00:03:52.860> could<00:03:53.010> be<00:03:53.129> purple<00:03:53.400> Freddy<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.030> that's<00:03:54.180> why

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
it could be purple Freddy and that's why

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.649 
it could be purple Freddy and that's why
maybe<00:03:55.019> purple<00:03:55.439> Freddy<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.069> important<00:03:56.670> now<00:03:56.849> but

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
maybe purple Freddy so important now but

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.289 
maybe purple Freddy so important now but
to<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.260> honest<00:03:58.560> guys<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:59.010> still<00:03:59.400> don't<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.849> but

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
to be honest guys I still don't know but

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.000 
to be honest guys I still don't know but
I<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.390> wanted<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.810> show<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.140> guys<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.830> think

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
I just wanted to show you guys to think

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.640 
I just wanted to show you guys to think
about<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.580> like<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.970> always<00:04:03.150> say<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.500> is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650

mean<00:04:15.030> something

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
mean something

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.199
