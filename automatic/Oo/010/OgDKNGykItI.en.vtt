00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.489

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 finally forced out by the bouncers 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.809

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.400
 so while I was trying to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.689
 discreetly take off the pieces of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.680
