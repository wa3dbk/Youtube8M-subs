this is going to be at the bottom when

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.330 
this is going to be at the bottom when
you're<00:00:22.140> launching<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.619> up<00:00:22.710> which<00:00:23.160> could

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you're launching it up which could

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
you're launching it up which could
easily<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.730> hidden<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> top<00:00:24.869> when

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
malfunction now let's check out the top
two<00:01:30.150> regular<00:01:30.479> pistons<00:01:30.869> once<00:01:31.680> again<00:01:31.890> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
two regular pistons once again some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.380 
two regular pistons once again some
immovable<00:01:32.549> blocks<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
immovable blocks and a little bit of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.580 
immovable blocks and a little bit of
redstone<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> need

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
redstone is all you need

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
redstone is all you need
then<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> course<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.490> buttons<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> send<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
then of course two buttons to send you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.450 
then of course two buttons to send you
on<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.329> way<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.259> takes

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
on your way and that's all it takes

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.679 
on your way and that's all it takes
something<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> mention<00:01:38.970> before<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
something to mention before we get on to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
something to mention before we get on to
the<00:01:39.780> tutorial<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.950> design<00:01:41.280> can

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the tutorial is that this design can

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
the tutorial is that this design can
only<00:01:41.640> face<00:01:41.880> north<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.509> south<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.130> look<00:01:44.250> at

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
only face north and south if we look at

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
only face north and south if we look at
the<00:01:44.399> f3<00:01:44.729> menu<00:01:45.030> you'll<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.540> facing<00:01:45.899> south

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the f3 menu you'll see the facing south

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
the f3 menu you'll see the facing south
and<00:01:46.350> facing<00:01:46.860> north<00:01:47.100> option<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.670> I'm<00:01:48.630> facing

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and facing north option if I'm facing

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.170 
and facing north option if I'm facing
west<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.560> east<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> build<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
west or east when I build this this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.060 
west or east when I build this this
machine<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.810> work<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> due<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
machine will not work this is due to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.469 
machine will not work this is due to
some<00:01:53.310> directional<00:01:53.670> mechanics<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.270> I'll<00:01:54.360> look

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
some directional mechanics and I'll look

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.060 
some directional mechanics and I'll look
for<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> fix<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.229> soon<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for a fix for this soon but for now I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
for a fix for this soon but for now I
don't<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.850> you'll<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> build

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
don't have one so you'll have to build

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870 
don't have one so you'll have to build
this<00:01:57.869> either<00:01:58.049> facing<00:01:58.290> north<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.829> south<00:01:59.100> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this either facing north or south that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
this either facing north or south that
is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> drawback<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.500> easy<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> get

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is a drawback but it's very easy to get

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
is a drawback but it's very easy to get
around<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.579> let's<00:02:02.640> move<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> tutorial

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
around so let's move on to the tutorial

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780

that's all your machine should now be

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.140 
that's all your machine should now be
working<00:05:37.710> make<00:05:38.340> sure<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.669> while<00:05:38.940> you're

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
working make sure that while you're

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.060 
working make sure that while you're
building<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.600> you<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:39.900> not<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.320> any<00:05:40.620> normal

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
building this you do not have any normal

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.040 
building this you do not have any normal
blocks<00:05:41.310> contacting<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.180> slime<00:05:42.390> blocks<00:05:42.660> so

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
blocks contacting the slime blocks so

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.300 
blocks contacting the slime blocks so
that<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.410> slime<00:05:43.650> blocks<00:05:43.860> would<00:05:44.010> attempt<00:05:44.250> to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
that the slime blocks would attempt to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.800 
that the slime blocks would attempt to
pull<00:05:44.550> them<00:05:44.700> upwards<00:05:45.030> which<00:05:45.330> would<00:05:45.510> ruin<00:05:45.660> the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
pull them upwards which would ruin the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.630 
pull them upwards which would ruin the
machine<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.740> do<00:05:46.950> have<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.160> little<00:05:47.340> bit<00:05:47.550> of

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
machine you do have a little bit of

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.520 
machine you do have a little bit of
extra<00:05:47.850> room<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.450> machine<00:05:48.750> in<00:05:48.900> certain

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
extra room on the machine in certain

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.529 
extra room on the machine in certain
spots<00:05:49.770> however<00:05:50.550> in<00:05:50.760> most<00:05:50.940> cases<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.479> going

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
spots however in most cases it's going

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.480 
spots however in most cases it's going
to<00:05:51.690> cause<00:05:51.840> contact<00:05:52.320> you<00:05:52.440> don't<00:05:52.620> want<00:05:52.860> but<00:05:53.400> you

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
to cause contact you don't want but you

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.550 
to cause contact you don't want but you
do<00:05:53.640> have<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:54.060> extra<00:05:54.419> block<00:05:54.600> space<00:05:54.900> just<00:05:55.410> in

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
do have to extra block space just in

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.469 
do have to extra block space just in
case<00:05:55.770> just<00:05:56.580> approve<00:05:56.940> this<00:05:57.090> I'm<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.390> go

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
case just approve this I'm going to go

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.370 
case just approve this I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.810> put<00:05:57.960> two<00:05:58.140> blocks<00:05:58.289> directly<00:05:58.770> here

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
ahead and put two blocks directly here

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.320 
ahead and put two blocks directly here
and<00:06:01.380> let<00:06:01.560> it<00:06:01.590> go<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.770> work

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.119 

there<00:06:05.960> you<00:06:06.080> go<00:06:06.199> that's<00:06:06.439> the<00:06:06.650> extra<00:06:06.889> space<00:06:07.099> you

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
there you go that's the extra space you

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.129 
there you go that's the extra space you
have<00:06:07.460> but<00:06:08.000> besides<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:08.449> you<00:06:08.720> can't<00:06:08.990> have

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
have but besides that you can't have

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.600 
have but besides that you can't have
walls<00:06:09.439> built<00:06:09.740> up<00:06:09.889> directly<00:06:10.220> next<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.550> the

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
walls built up directly next to the

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.159 
walls built up directly next to the
machine<00:06:10.819> that<00:06:10.849> have<00:06:11.060> normal<00:06:11.210> blocks<00:06:11.599> because

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
machine that have normal blocks because

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.629 
machine that have normal blocks because
it<00:06:12.289> will<00:06:12.500> ruin<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.949> way<00:06:13.039> the<00:06:13.159> flying<00:06:13.370> machine

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
it will ruin the way the flying machine

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.790 
it will ruin the way the flying machine
works<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:15.050> make<00:06:15.379> sure<00:06:15.409> that<00:06:15.590> you're<00:06:15.710> careful

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
works so make sure that you're careful

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.350 
works so make sure that you're careful
with<00:06:16.039> that<00:06:16.159> you<00:06:16.340> can<00:06:16.550> have<00:06:16.699> a<00:06:16.729> movable<00:06:17.180> box

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
with that you can have a movable box

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.520 
with that you can have a movable box
next<00:06:17.629> to<00:06:17.659> it<00:06:17.780> cuz<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:17.990> slime<00:06:18.139> machine<00:06:18.409> won't
