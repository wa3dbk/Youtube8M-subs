two are you confused yet I am so the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.430 
two are you confused yet I am so the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
question becomes how much do we need

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.259 
question becomes how much do we need
there<00:02:49.590> because<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.400> actually<00:02:50.640> need

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
there because we don't actually need

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.060 
there because we don't actually need
other<00:02:51.570> dietary<00:02:52.110> fats<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.560> produce<00:02:52.890> hormones

in the body there have been studies that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.930 
in the body there have been studies that
show<00:02:55.230> when<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.709> cut<00:02:55.950> our<00:02:56.130> dietary<00:02:56.550> fat<00:02:56.760> way

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940

show when we cut our dietary fat way
back<00:02:57.209> some<00:02:57.480> hormones<00:02:57.840> will<00:02:57.959> crash<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.410> a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.640 
the whole logic behind we need dietary
fat<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:25.980> hormones<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.519> because<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:28.470> need

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
fat for hormones is because we need

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.949 
fat for hormones is because we need
cholesterol<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.670> build<00:03:29.880> hormones<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.750> most

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
hormones are made out of cholesterol but

Dietetics<00:03:56.400> Association<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:57.150> say<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.480> we

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
Dietetics Association will say that we

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.390 
Dietetics Association will say that we
need<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:57.959> adults<00:03:58.260> they<00:03:58.500> don't<00:03:58.680> specify<00:03:58.950> body

weight they don't specify sex that we

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.949

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
need 50 grams of fat per day their logic

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.990 
need 50 grams of fat per day their logic
behind<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.739> because<00:04:04.769> around<00:04:05.400> 50<00:04:05.730> grams

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000

behind that is because around 50 grams
of<00:04:06.180> fat<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.359> day<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.019> they<00:04:07.200> assume<00:04:07.560> about<00:04:07.709> a

fats<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:10.049> average<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.489> get<00:04:11.640> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
fats on average and so you get the

speculation the same with the

they oftentimes say that we need a

minimum of 18 grams of fat to survive in
the<00:04:22.590> long<00:04:22.620> term<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> speculation<00:04:25.620> it's

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the long term that is a speculation it's

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.700 
the long term that is a speculation it's
an<00:04:26.340> educated<00:04:26.910> guess<00:04:27.510> we<00:04:27.840> don't<00:04:27.990> actually<00:04:28.320> have

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
an educated guess we don't actually have

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.900 
an educated guess we don't actually have
science<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:30.030> prove<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:31.460> even<00:04:32.460> though<00:04:32.700> some

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
science to prove it even though some

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.660 
science to prove it even though some
very<00:04:33.090> intelligent<00:04:33.620> experts<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.860> scientists

very intelligent experts and scientists

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.830 
very intelligent experts and scientists
have<00:04:35.760> come<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.000> with<00:04:36.030> those<00:04:36.240> numbers

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
have come up with those numbers

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.050 
have come up with those numbers
now<00:04:37.260> what<00:04:37.470> they<00:04:37.590> do<00:04:37.650> say<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.730> reason

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
now what they do say is that the reason

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.510 
now what they do say is that the reason
we<00:04:39.180> need<00:04:39.360> 18<00:04:39.720> grams<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.770> not<00:04:41.040> because<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:41.370> need

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
we need 18 grams is not because we need

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.040 
we need 18 grams is not because we need
18<00:04:41.820> grams<00:04:42.060> we<00:04:42.270> don't<00:04:42.450> need<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.660> other<00:04:42.720> fats

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
18 grams we don't need the other fats

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.040 
18 grams we don't need the other fats
because<00:04:43.260> we<00:04:43.470> need<00:04:43.620> 18<00:04:44.040> grams<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.900> those<00:04:45.900> are

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
because we need 18 grams of those are

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.270 
because we need 18 grams of those are
two<00:04:46.290> essential<00:04:46.830> fats<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:49.860> claim<00:04:50.130> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
two essential fats and they claim that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.150 
two essential fats and they claim that
we<00:04:50.430> need<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.700> around<00:04:51.120> 1.6<00:04:52.110> grams<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.980> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
we need to around 1.6 grams of the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.330 
we need to around 1.6 grams of the
omega-3<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> ala<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:55.230> we<00:04:55.380> need<00:04:55.530> about<00:04:55.740> 17

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
omega-3 the ala and we need about 17

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.840 
omega-3 the ala and we need about 17
grams<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.780> omega-6<00:04:58.230> TLA<00:04:58.950> so

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
grams of the omega-6 TLA so

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.510 
grams of the omega-6 TLA so
approximately<00:05:00.240> 18<00:05:01.140> point<00:05:01.620> 6<00:05:01.860> grams<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.460> fat

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
approximately 18 point 6 grams of fat

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.690 
approximately 18 point 6 grams of fat
but<00:05:03.480> that's<00:05:03.690> not<00:05:03.900> proven<00:05:04.200> with<00:05:04.500> data<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.520> it

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
but that's not proven with data so it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.240 
but that's not proven with data so it
gets<00:05:05.850> really<00:05:06.060> tricky<00:05:06.950> determining<00:05:07.950> how<00:05:08.070> much

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
gets really tricky determining how much

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.860 
gets really tricky determining how much
fat<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.520> need<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.240> what<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.390> would<00:05:09.510> say<00:05:09.810> to

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
fat you need and so what I would say to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.230 
fat you need and so what I would say to
people<00:05:10.050> don't<00:05:10.950> worry<00:05:11.130> about<00:05:11.250> fat<00:05:11.580> minimum<00:05:11.970> try

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
people don't worry about fat minimum try

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.460 
people don't worry about fat minimum try
to<00:05:12.300> hit<00:05:12.480> those<00:05:12.570> numbers<00:05:12.750> try<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.170> get<00:05:13.350> at<00:05:13.440> least

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
to hit those numbers try to get at least

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.470 
to hit those numbers try to get at least
one<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.010> half<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.340> two<00:05:14.490> grams<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.910> omega-3

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
one and a half to two grams of omega-3

recommend<00:05:35.040> something<00:05:35.310> like<00:05:35.430> ground<00:05:35.790> flaxseed

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
recommend something like ground flaxseed

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.480 
recommend something like ground flaxseed
because<00:05:36.600> you'll<00:05:36.750> get<00:05:36.960> both<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.170> them<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.830> then

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
because you'll get both of them and then

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.400 
because you'll get both of them and then
you'll<00:05:38.610> get<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.850> other<00:05:38.880> omega-6<00:05:39.870> from<00:05:40.050> basic

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
you'll get the other omega-6 from basic

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.740 
you'll get the other omega-6 from basic
things<00:05:40.620> like<00:05:40.860> rice<00:05:41.330> I'll<00:05:42.330> be<00:05:42.420> able<00:05:42.480> to<00:05:42.600> fill

we can burn fat we can even box dice
protein<00:06:06.330> for<00:06:06.510> fuel<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:06.930> that's<00:06:07.560> what<00:06:07.710> you

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
protein for fuel and that's what you

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.830
