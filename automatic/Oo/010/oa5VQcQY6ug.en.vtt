00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
roof yeah yeah and so yeah i thought

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.960 
roof yeah yeah and so yeah i thought

so this is a one-to-one copy i had to go

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.060 
so this is a one-to-one copy i had to go
in<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> watch<00:00:51.089> all<00:00:51.450> their<00:00:51.660> videos<00:00:51.860> pause<00:00:52.860> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
paintings are exactly the same and there

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820

are<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.479> double<00:01:15.750> chess<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.170> Minecraft<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
are no double chess in Minecraft so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.460 
are no double chess in Minecraft so
every<00:01:17.610> time<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.300> a<00:01:18.330> piece<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.720> wood<00:01:18.990> saying

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
every time I have a piece of wood saying

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
every time I have a piece of wood saying
double<00:01:19.740> cheese<00:01:19.950> no<00:01:20.190> just<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.940> chests

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
double cheese no just just two chests

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
double cheese no just just two chests
cuz<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> can't<00:01:22.740> put<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.190> next<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> each

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cuz I can't put them right next to each

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
cuz I can't put them right next to each
other<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.270> no<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> can't<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.409> chip<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
other right and no you can't I chip and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
other right and no you can't I chip and
axes<00:01:26.970> Gavin's<00:01:27.390> house<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> hardest

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
axes Gavin's house this is the hardest

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
axes Gavin's house this is the hardest
probably<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.729> every<00:01:30.299> painting<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
probably because every painting in this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
probably because every painting in this
room<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.409> correct<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.490> had<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> keep

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
room is correct and I had to keep

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
room is correct and I had to keep
putting<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.330> pings<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.259> over<00:01:34.470> again

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
putting the pings down and over again

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.359 
putting the pings down and over again
