00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 I'm going to teach one more prescription today. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.349
 light diet manual of the world for you 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 to do at the Christmas fair is the rocambole 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 prestige will need four 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.619
 basic ingredients of grated coconut 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.080
 condensed milk two cans milk in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.189
 powder and chocolate powder 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
 you also need some other 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.539
 kitchen utensils but they are things that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.730
 any kitchen have you been seeing 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.969
 throughout the video the first thing is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.710
 mix a can of 395 grams of milk 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.710
 condensed souls the dollar has in my there 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.360
 the first thing is to mix a can of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 395 grams of condensed milk with 100 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 grams of cocaine 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 the sixth sixth mix on the stove over fire 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.699
 down until it gets tough you start 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590
 to make roads in the pan at the time 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 What do you give the spatula? 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.090
 When you 're ready you have to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.490
 let this delicious massaroca cool 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 because you can burn your hand and now 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 You have to do the other mass. 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.869
 mixing in this bowl two cups of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 milk powder and two cups of chocolate 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 powder and I know you're going to ask me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.110
 released chocolaty power can indeed I 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.979
 I'm going to use chocolate, but it's too much. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.979
 sweeter 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.609
 and now you're going to have to do this 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.130
 massaroca mixing condensed milk 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.679
 gradually the secret is to form a mass 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.929
 that is not very sticky other than 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.929
 very liquid that you can put into the 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.929
 hand and will not stick to your hand. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.560
 if you finish the condensed milk and you 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.399
 still need to look more at the mass you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:10.220
 can put a little water 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:12.440
 the next thing is to join two 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.019
 sheets of aluminum which is where you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.019
 to be rolled or rolled 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.660
 and now you have to spread this 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.660
 massaroca right in the middle of the first leaf 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.069
 now you take the other sheet that already 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:46.250
 is mounted and overlaps and the 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.690
 next step is to but there is this massaroca 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.280
 in a very uniform way 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.019
 you can do this by using a roll of 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.610
 pasta that is ideal and I do not have 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:04.849
 here or you can use a bottle or the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:07.430
 own paperboard from today 's paper 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.950
 ready rocambole base now it's time 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.950
 of filling the filling 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.450
 and now with a lot of affection it's time to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.450
 to roll the rocambole 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 the aluminum foil itself or be 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 wrapping rocambole puts on top of 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.680
 something stiff and takes in the refrigerator 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.680
 for him to be hard and cold 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:04:01.069
 and now is the hour of truth but also 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.730
 Let's combine is condensed milk with 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:14.239
 coconut milk powder and chocolate comes down 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:18.759
 wrong but I did not know that you 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.759
 found in the world manual
