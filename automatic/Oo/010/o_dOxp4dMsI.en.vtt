00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
hi guys today I want to show you how to

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.619 
hi guys today I want to show you how to
control<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:11.900> amount<00:00:12.049> of<00:00:12.169> RAM<00:00:12.530> that<00:00:12.919> is

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
control the amount of RAM that is

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.570 
control the amount of RAM that is
allocated<00:00:14.629> for<00:00:14.809> your<00:00:15.289> minecraft<00:00:15.889> server<00:00:16.280> and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
allocated for your minecraft server and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.259 
allocated for your minecraft server and
this<00:00:17.510> works<00:00:17.750> with<00:00:18.109> both<00:00:18.679> vanilla<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.670> bucket

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
this works with both vanilla and bucket

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.890 
this works with both vanilla and bucket
servers<00:00:20.689> it<00:00:21.019> works<00:00:21.230> with<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.039> dot<00:00:22.250> exe

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
servers it works with the dot exe

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.210 
servers it works with the dot exe
versions<00:00:23.900> of<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.109> server<00:00:24.349> and<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:24.769> jar

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
versions of the server and the jar

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.060 
versions of the server and the jar
versions<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:27.199> first<00:00:27.439> thing<00:00:27.589> you<00:00:27.710> want<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:27.890> do

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
versions the first thing you want to do

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.470 
versions the first thing you want to do
is<00:00:28.900> right-click<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.439> go<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.740> new<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.480> then

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
is right-click and go to new and then

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.700 
is right-click and go to new and then
we're<00:00:32.570> going<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.750> create<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.020> text<00:00:33.530> document

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
we're going to create a text document

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.360 
we're going to create a text document
and<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:35.989> case<00:00:36.289> if<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:37.010> don't<00:00:37.160> already

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
and in this case if you don't already

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.189 
and in this case if you don't already
have<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:38.680> start<00:00:39.680> server<00:00:41.140> dot<00:00:42.140> bat<00:00:43.239> file<00:00:44.239> you

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
have a start server dot bat file you

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.450 
have a start server dot bat file you
want<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.410> go<00:00:45.469> ahead<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.739> create<00:00:45.980> one<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.340> this

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
want to go ahead and create one in this

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.979 
want to go ahead and create one in this
case<00:00:46.670> if<00:00:46.850> you're<00:00:46.940> using<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.329> exe<00:00:47.750> you

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
case if you're using the exe you

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.740 
case if you're using the exe you
probably<00:00:48.350> don't<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:48.829> this<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.570> if<00:00:50.570> you

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
probably don't have this and if you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.060 
probably don't have this and if you
don't<00:00:50.960> understand<00:00:51.469> what<00:00:51.620> I'm<00:00:51.710> doing<00:00:51.980> right

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
don't understand what I'm doing right

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.450 
don't understand what I'm doing right
now<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.640> video<00:00:52.940> on<00:00:53.000> how<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:54.039> create<00:00:55.039> a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
now I have a video on how to create a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.610 
now I have a video on how to create a
minecraft<00:00:56.269> server<00:00:56.359> that<00:00:56.719> explains<00:00:57.170> what<00:00:57.410> this

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
minecraft server that explains what this

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.360 
minecraft server that explains what this
start<00:00:58.039> server<00:00:58.250> file<00:00:58.579> does<00:00:59.590> but<00:01:00.590> for<00:01:00.620> now<00:01:00.890> let's

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
start server file does but for now let's

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.360 
start server file does but for now let's
go<00:01:01.550> ahead<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.179> open<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.079> up<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:03.440> we'll<00:01:03.980> edit<00:01:04.190> it

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
go ahead and open it up so we'll edit it

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.749 
go ahead and open it up so we'll edit it
in<00:01:04.570> notepad<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:08.270> your<00:01:09.070> bat<00:01:10.070> file<00:01:10.430> that's

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
in notepad and in your bat file that's

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.850 
in notepad and in your bat file that's
used<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.210> start<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.600> server<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.619> want<00:01:12.710> to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
used to start the server you want to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.910 
used to start the server you want to
type<00:01:13.009> in<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.250> following<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.140> Java

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
type in the following and that is Java

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.429 
type in the following and that is Java
space<00:01:16.460> -<00:01:17.409> capital<00:01:18.409> X<00:01:18.619> lowercase<00:01:19.520> MS<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.479> then

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
space - capital X lowercase MS and then

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.190 
space - capital X lowercase MS and then
what<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.710> have<00:01:21.740> here<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.909> numerical<00:01:23.780> value

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
what you have here is a numerical value

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100 
what you have here is a numerical value
for<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.710> amount<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.009> memory<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:26.509> going

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
for the amount of memory that is going

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.460 
for the amount of memory that is going
to<00:01:27.229> be<00:01:27.380> initially<00:01:28.070> used<00:01:28.310> for<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.970> server<00:01:29.470> so

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
to be initially used for the server so

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.710 
to be initially used for the server so
when<00:01:30.619> your<00:01:30.770> server<00:01:30.979> first<00:01:31.250> starts<00:01:31.579> up<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:32.450> will

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
when your server first starts up it will

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.880 
when your server first starts up it will
use<00:01:32.930> up<00:01:33.170> 512<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.759> then<00:01:35.600> M<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:36.229> megabytes<00:01:36.649> of

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
use up 512 and then M for megabytes of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.240 
use up 512 and then M for megabytes of
RAM<00:01:37.810> now<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.869> can<00:01:39.079> set<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:39.500> lower<00:01:39.920> or

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
RAM now you can set that to lower or

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.240 
RAM now you can set that to lower or
higher<00:01:40.479> but<00:01:41.479> basically<00:01:41.899> when<00:01:42.619> it's<00:01:43.329> using<00:01:45.250> Ram

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
higher but basically when it's using Ram

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.760 
higher but basically when it's using Ram
and<00:01:46.579> it's<00:01:46.969> getting<00:01:47.270> up<00:01:47.390> there<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.409> can<00:01:48.590> tell

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and it's getting up there you can tell

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.670 
and it's getting up there you can tell
it<00:01:48.920> how<00:01:49.100> much<00:01:49.340> total<00:01:49.969> it<00:01:50.450> can<00:01:50.960> use<00:01:51.170> until<00:01:51.590> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
it how much total it can use until it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.940 
it how much total it can use until it
maxes<00:01:52.070> out<00:01:52.219> and<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.479> case<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:54.380> command

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
maxes out and in this case that command

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.620 
maxes out and in this case that command
is<00:01:55.189> expressed<00:01:55.670> by<00:01:55.790> -<00:01:57.100> capital<00:01:58.100> X<00:01:58.390> lowercase<00:01:59.390> M

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
is expressed by - capital X lowercase M

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.590 
is expressed by - capital X lowercase M
X<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.200> then<00:02:00.920> another<00:02:01.159> numerical<00:02:01.399> value<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.090> G

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
X and then another numerical value and G

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.639 
X and then another numerical value and G
is<00:02:02.810> 4<00:02:03.020> gigabytes<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.750> can<00:02:05.899> even<00:02:06.020> do<00:02:06.200> kilobytes

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
is 4 gigabytes you can even do kilobytes

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.160 
is 4 gigabytes you can even do kilobytes
if<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:06.890> wanted<00:02:07.159> but<00:02:07.310> basically<00:02:08.020> what<00:02:09.020> this

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
if you wanted but basically what this

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.590 
if you wanted but basically what this
represents<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.980> I<00:02:10.220> am<00:02:10.370> allowing<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
represents is that I am allowing a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.300 
represents is that I am allowing a
maximum<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:12.950> gigabyte<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.580> ram<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:14.030> be

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
maximum of one gigabyte of ram to be

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.240 
maximum of one gigabyte of ram to be
used<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.670> server<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.709> right-click<00:02:16.920> on

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
used for my server if you right-click on

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.300 
used for my server if you right-click on
my<00:02:17.400> computer<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.000> go<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> properties<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:20.160> can

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
my computer and go to properties you can

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.800 
my computer and go to properties you can
see<00:02:20.489> how<00:02:20.610> much<00:02:20.730> installed<00:02:21.150> memory<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.599> have

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
see how much installed memory you have

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.570 
see how much installed memory you have
and<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:22.770> basically<00:02:22.920> tell<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.430> how

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and that will basically tell you how

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.970 
and that will basically tell you how
much<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.910> should<00:02:23.940> use<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.650> six

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
much you should use if you have like six

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.300 
much you should use if you have like six
or<00:02:26.370> eight<00:02:26.610> gigabytes<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.310> if

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
or eight gigabytes and you're on a if

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.570 
or eight gigabytes and you're on a if
you<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.580> your<00:02:29.730> your<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:31.920> minecraft<00:02:32.340> server

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you have your your your minecraft server

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.309 
you have your your your minecraft server
on<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> dedicated<00:02:33.120> server<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.170> pretty

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
on a dedicated server you can pretty

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.809 
on a dedicated server you can pretty
much<00:02:34.410> afford<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.950> use<00:02:35.130> most<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.580> RAM

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
much afford to use most of the RAM

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.670 
much afford to use most of the RAM
because<00:02:35.970> you're<00:02:36.269> not<00:02:36.390> using<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.810> that's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
because you're not using that that's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.589 
because you're not using that that's
server<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.160> anything<00:02:38.340> else<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.390> being

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
server for anything else if it's being

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.080 
server for anything else if it's being
hosted<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.319> local<00:02:40.590> machine<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.250> would<00:02:41.880> say

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
hosted on your local machine I would say

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.120 
hosted on your local machine I would say
use<00:02:42.420> about<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> quarter<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.470> RAM<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:44.010> way

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
use about a quarter of the RAM that way

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.170 
use about a quarter of the RAM that way
you<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.370> enough<00:02:44.610> left<00:02:44.849> for<00:02:45.060> other

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
you have enough left for other

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.800 
you have enough left for other
applications<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:48.209> next<00:02:48.450> part<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
applications on the next part of this

code<00:02:49.080> here<00:02:49.519> reading<00:02:50.519> -<00:02:50.819> jar<00:02:51.530> space<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.860> then

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
code here reading - jar space and then

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.320 
code here reading - jar space and then
what<00:02:54.540> follows<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> space<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.680> basically<00:02:56.330> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
what follows the space is basically the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.729 
what follows the space is basically the
name<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> file<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.319> we're<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> be

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
name of the file that we're going to be

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.039 
name of the file that we're going to be
opening<00:02:59.099> up<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.750> case<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.620> default

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
opening up so in this case the default

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.580 
opening up so in this case the default

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
for the official wiki tutorial is to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.070 
for the official wiki tutorial is to
just<00:03:07.830> add<00:03:08.010> minecraft<00:03:08.640> underscore<00:03:09.269> server<00:03:09.540> jar

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
just add minecraft underscore server jar

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.339 
just add minecraft underscore server jar
in<00:03:10.290> my<00:03:10.549> case<00:03:11.549> I'm<00:03:12.180> trying<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> open<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.200> this

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
in my case I'm trying to open up this

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.800 
in my case I'm trying to open up this
file<00:03:13.590> right<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> well<00:03:15.239> what<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.569> want<00:03:15.720> to

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
file right here so well what I want to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.550 
file right here so well what I want to
do<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.310> copy<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.580> name<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.260> then<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.470> go

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
do is copy the name and then just go

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.250 
do is copy the name and then just go
ahead<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.890> paste<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.959> way<00:03:22.109> it's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
ahead and paste it there that way it's

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.740 
ahead and paste it there that way it's
opening<00:03:22.530> up<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.799> correct<00:03:23.070> file<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:24.540> will

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
opening up the correct file this will

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.190 
opening up the correct file this will
work<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.019> both<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.350> jar<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.890> Exe<00:03:27.200> so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
work with both the jar and the Exe so

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.410 
work with both the jar and the Exe so
basically<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:28.829> once<00:03:29.280> you've<00:03:29.400> done<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.609> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
basically then once you've done that you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.270 
basically then once you've done that you
can<00:03:30.630> save<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.620> bat<00:03:32.040> file<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:34.250> double<00:03:35.250> click

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
can save this bat file and double click

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.710 
can save this bat file and double click
on<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:36.950> there<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.600> server<00:03:39.600> is

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
on it and there you go server is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.830 
on it and there you go server is
currently<00:03:39.870> using<00:03:40.230> 51<00:03:40.769> megabytes<00:03:41.220> if<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:42.660> needs

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
currently using 51 megabytes if it needs

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.420 
currently using 51 megabytes if it needs
to<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.230> go<00:03:43.319> all<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> way<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.859> one<00:03:43.980> gigabyte

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
to can go all the way up to one gigabyte

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.599 
to can go all the way up to one gigabyte
or<00:03:44.579> whatever<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.239> set<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:47.280> easy<00:03:47.459> as
