when I joined Metallica in 83 and
started<00:00:17.359> getting<00:00:17.449> some<00:00:17.689> pocket<00:00:18.109> change<00:00:18.369> one

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
started getting some pocket change one

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.480 
started getting some pocket change one
of<00:00:19.400> my<00:00:19.550> first<00:00:19.910> purchases<00:00:20.660> was<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.529> EMG<00:00:22.009> pickup

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
of my first purchases was a EMG pickup

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.870 
of my first purchases was a EMG pickup
and<00:00:22.779> that<00:00:23.779> was<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.259> beginning<00:00:27.640> when<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:28.669> put

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
that Gamgee pickup in there the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.370 
that Gamgee pickup in there the
difference<00:00:31.730> was<00:00:32.050> considerable

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.069 

so<00:00:35.920> much<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.460> James<00:00:36.910> kind<00:00:37.420> of<00:00:37.510> like<00:00:37.630> whoa

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
wasn't long before he was using it EMG

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.270 
wasn't long before he was using it EMG
