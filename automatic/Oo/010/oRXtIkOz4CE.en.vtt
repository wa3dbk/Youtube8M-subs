00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
so here's how this works this comes

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.979 
so here's how this works this comes
apart<00:00:53.830> and<00:00:54.830> down<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.390> compact

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
apart and down in here is a compact

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.430 
apart and down in here is a compact
little<00:00:57.260> cleaning<00:00:57.739> rod<00:00:58.269> that's<00:00:59.269> just<00:00:59.659> over<00:00:59.989> six

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
little cleaning rod that's just over six

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.240 
little cleaning rod that's just over six
inches<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.949> length<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:03.440> course<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.949> can

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
inches in length and of course that can

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.649 
inches in length and of course that can
then<00:01:04.460> well<00:01:04.970> actually<00:01:05.120> i<00:01:05.330> put<00:01:05.480> it<00:01:05.570> together

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
then well actually i put it together

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.770 
then well actually i put it together
backwards<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:08.659> screws<00:01:09.050> on<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:09.440> like<00:01:09.560> that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
backwards that screws on there like that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.390 
backwards that screws on there like that
and<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.050> second<00:01:12.500> one<00:01:12.530> has<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:12.950> pivot

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
and then the second one has this pivot

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560 
and then the second one has this pivot
so<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.000> going<00:01:14.180> through<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
so that is it's going through the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.680 
so that is it's going through the
rifling<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:16.040> will<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.060> will<00:01:17.120> allowed<00:01:17.479> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
rifling it will it will allowed to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.639 
rifling it will it will allowed to
rotate<00:01:17.870> for<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.079> can<00:01:21.229> add<00:01:21.409> your

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
rotate for you then you can add your

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.260 
rotate for you then you can add your
attachments<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.430> this<00:01:22.549> is<00:01:22.729> against<00:01:23.090> about

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
attachments and this is against about

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.719 
attachments and this is against about
six<00:01:23.509> inches<00:01:23.689> long<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.320> when<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.399> look<00:01:25.430> at

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
six inches long and when you look at

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.940 
six inches long and when you look at
something<00:01:25.939> like<00:01:26.200> pushing<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.290> patch<00:01:27.530> through

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
something like pushing a patch through

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.080 
something like pushing a patch through
it<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:28.130> go<00:01:28.280> ahead<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.670> add<00:01:30.009> your<00:01:31.009> tool<00:01:31.340> that

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
it you go ahead and add your tool that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.249 
it you go ahead and add your tool that
gives<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.360> another<00:01:32.539> inch<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.140> will

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
gives you another inch so this will

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.319 
gives you another inch so this will
handle<00:01:33.530> up<00:01:33.649> to<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.799> seven<00:01:34.219> inch<00:01:34.340> barrel<00:01:34.789> handgun

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
handle up to a seven inch barrel handgun

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.600 
handle up to a seven inch barrel handgun
so<00:01:35.899> just<00:01:36.110> about<00:01:36.229> any<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.649> your<00:01:36.799> semi-auto<00:01:37.369> is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
so just about any of your semi-auto is

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.429 
so just about any of your semi-auto is
that<00:01:37.729> most<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.210> revolvers<00:01:38.930> this<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.259> going

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
that most of you revolvers this is going

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.200 
that most of you revolvers this is going

to work as a good cleaning kit for and
nice<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.409> have<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.649> little<00:01:42.829> cleaning<00:01:43.310> kit<00:01:43.640> with

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
you when you're at the range even when

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.139 
you when you're at the range even when
you<00:01:45.259> make<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.409> quick<00:01:45.680> trip<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:46.219> the<00:01:46.250> range<00:01:46.490> so

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
you make a quick trip to the range so

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.060 
you make a quick trip to the range so
this<00:01:47.270> could<00:01:47.420> go<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.719> blog<00:01:48.020> glove<00:01:48.380> boxes<00:01:48.890> can

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.340 
go into a range bag this can go anywhere
and<00:01:51.680> i<00:01:52.399> had<00:01:52.640> an<00:01:52.729> interesting<00:01:53.000> thought<00:01:53.509> even

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
and i had an interesting thought even

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.719 
and i had an interesting thought even
though<00:01:54.469> they're<00:01:54.649> five<00:01:54.890> bucks<00:01:55.159> apiece<00:01:55.280> this

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
though they're five bucks apiece this

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.060 
though they're five bucks apiece this
would<00:01:55.880> be<00:01:55.969> kind<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.240> expensive<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.930> do<00:01:57.109> but

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
would be kind of expensive to do but

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.010 
would be kind of expensive to do but
check<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.369> out<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.149> bought<00:01:59.539> three<00:01:59.990> of

these you'd end up with a bunch of
brushes<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.020> mean<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.469> five<00:02:03.740> bucks<00:02:04.100> you're

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
brushes and I mean at five bucks you're

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.179 
brushes and I mean at five bucks you're
getting<00:02:04.869> three<00:02:05.869> different<00:02:06.289> brushes<00:02:06.590> and

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
getting three different brushes and

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.760 
getting three different brushes and

brushes do wear out you're getting

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.540

basically<00:02:10.550> it's<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.910> tool<00:02:11.180> that's<00:02:11.210> 22<00:02:12.110> caliber

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
universal because you could put any size

universal because you could put any size
patch<00:02:16.490> there<00:02:16.820> or<00:02:17.180> use<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.600> push<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> patch
