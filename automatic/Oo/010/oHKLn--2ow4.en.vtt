00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 the teachers of the state 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.470
 São Paulo's schools decided to keep the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.719
 strike started 20 days ago 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 they made a new protest today and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
 tried to reach the government palace in the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 morumbi but were barred by the police 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 military 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.330
 ten people were injured in the confrontation 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
 around 3,500 teachers according to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.080
 military police have concentrated on 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 in front of the morumbi stadium 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.359
 At one point there was a mouthful between 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 protesters who also wanted to raise 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the show car 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 to perceive the presence of our team 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 with a group turned against a team of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 Thank you, Grafite. 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.710
 he recorded the conclusion until the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:53.219
 direction of the movement did not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 results on strike 19 days ago 11 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 teachers will be neutral 34% 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.850
 I do not understand the assessments for the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 teachers 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 according to the union, not being 60 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 and the government has not yet 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.260
 recognizes the great the secretary of the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 education says that only 1% of the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.049
 adhered and that the movement did not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 the progress of classes teachers 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.159
 accuse the São Paulo government of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.799
 because it does not agree to negotiate 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.830
 already the government says that the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.470
 teachers whose union is aligned with 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.759
 pt has electoral inspiration 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.729
 we were not well taken care of and not having 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.340
 negotiation space if they can not say 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.009
 which have made progress during the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 teachers decided to continue the strike 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.420
 then went on a march towards 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.909
 to the bandeirantes palace but not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.250
 were able to pass through the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.300
 police isolation the protesters 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.760
 came to overthrow 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.550
 photos of concrete and interdicted a 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.830
 passage to the government palace area is 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.570
 considered a safety hazard where 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.710
 manifestations are prohibited 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.060
 teachers are still on strike is a 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.110
 their right 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.760
 the government makes no concessions in a deadlock 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.980
 is established 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.220
 the confrontational scenes we've seen is 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.310
 that causes great amazement is difficult 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 differentiate seen that confrontation 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.890
 master teachers with the police is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.710
 difficult to tell whether we were 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.370
 watching soccer crowd one class 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.520
 revolted in protest or teachers who 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.490
 prepare future generations for the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 coping with life teachers who 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.890
 through lessons through what 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.760
 transmit in terms of knowledge 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.350
 help to train personalities will be in the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.260
 future of the country 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.610
 we live a moment of regret today 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.920
 it may be that somebody arrives 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.360
 teachers finally understand 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.000
 a group of them 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.000
 a commission was received by the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.340
 secretary of education and we do not know 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.230
 still the result of this meeting 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 for the moment the information we have is 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.100
 that the strike continues 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.910
 but what a confrontation like the one we ended up 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.700
 to see that it shows lack of civility 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.050
 lack of respect there is no 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.520
 against a line of protection to the 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.060
 seat of government 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.640
 there are limits to the manifestation for more 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.640
 legal and legitimate that it be
