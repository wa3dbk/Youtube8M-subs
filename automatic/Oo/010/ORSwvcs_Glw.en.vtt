will<00:04:32.760> pull<00:04:33.210> all<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.660> energy<00:04:34.020> out<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.350> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
will pull all the energy out of you and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.890 
will pull all the energy out of you and
it<00:04:34.740> will<00:04:34.860> leave<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.340> ragged<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:35.910> dry<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.840> you

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
it will leave you ragged and dry so you

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.590 
it will leave you ragged and dry so you
need<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.710> find<00:04:37.950> an<00:04:38.130> alternative<00:04:38.970> source<00:04:39.270> and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
need to find an alternative source and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.380 
need to find an alternative source and
alternative<00:04:40.110> energy<00:04:40.200> think<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:41.010> rage<00:04:41.280> as<00:04:41.580> like

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
alternative energy think of rage as like

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.500 
alternative energy think of rage as like
nuclear<00:04:42.780> power<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.640> positivity<00:04:44.640> is<00:04:45.060> like

nuclear power and positivity is like

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.500 
nuclear power and positivity is like
green<00:04:45.930> energy<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:47.010> want<00:04:47.220> green<00:04:47.610> energy<00:04:48.090> it

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
green energy you want green energy it

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.820 
green energy you want green energy it
might<00:04:48.720> be<00:04:48.840> harder<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.200> come<00:04:49.440> by<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
to focus on that kind of energy because

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.070 
to focus on that kind of energy because
that's<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.120> thing<00:04:57.300> that's<00:04:57.450> actually<00:04:57.870> gonna
