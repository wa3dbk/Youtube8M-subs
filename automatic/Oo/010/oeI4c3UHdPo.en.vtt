competition is a real game changer

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.550 
competition is a real game changer
because<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:26.000> allows<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.600> tire<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.080> go<00:01:27.229> beyond

because it allows the tire to go beyond
just<00:01:27.950> being<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.640> part<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.420> car<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:30.080> then

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
just being a part on the car it then

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.130 
just being a part on the car it then
becomes<00:01:31.310> part<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.270> overall<00:01:32.420> performance

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
becomes part of the overall performance

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.320 
becomes part of the overall performance
of<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.560> vehicle<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.190> where<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:34.789> part<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
of the vehicle to where it's part of the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:44.380
