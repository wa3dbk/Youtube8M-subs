 so if you're interested in knowing how the ice 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.920
 It will be difficult but I will explain

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 Juarez appended that no 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 It is therefore a good amount 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.879
 when we have it already 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.219
 soon in centimeters wide a little less 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 we crush 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 and we are not like that 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.609

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.609
 with several pieces of magazines 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.189

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 in the Finger 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.919
 we will go 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.309
 completing in this way 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.309
 until Friday 23 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.709

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.709
 in claims 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.079
 no other little dot 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 the closer 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.119

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 many tic projects 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.679
 also from this one 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.649
 we have to do 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 a brandy roll 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219
 as the voice says 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.779
 I started with a small roll 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.779
 and keeps putting science magazine 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.869
 throw and throw 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 until making her more secure than him 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.839
 later when I already had many projects 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.159
 I started hitting 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.379
 one or a grandmother 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.769
 maybe say 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.229
 here according to the biggest 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.400
 according to how well they go 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 and how to put composing 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.259

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.259
 of the big and the small that is impossible 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.719
 and so we have left 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.550
 Really 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.949

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.749
 wooden skewers 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.009
 of the project 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.729
 a piece of magazine 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.050
