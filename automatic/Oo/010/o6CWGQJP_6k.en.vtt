00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:19.810
 There is a class called perfume family in the rare prevention course, but there is a cloud in some of them 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.960
 I will introduce a course that says it is possible to have a rain 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.439
 Although the chest is written march 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:33.309
 In liquid crystal science I say aerosol 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:39.800
 This is fine particles that are Kofu in the air, but when water vapor turns into water droplets 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:45.790
 It's a core thing when you set it up, so it's three of these. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:54.010
 Emo- Everything is essential to make the cloud 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:54.670
 Why does it expand? The atmospheric pressure decreases as you go above the ground 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.450
 is not it 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:05.810
 So the pressure applied to this air mass will be smaller, so it can swell and swell. 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:12.710
 In this air sea by bulging 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:17.689
 The temperature is lowered The temperature is reduced The condensation of the contained water vapor 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.950
 It is not a drop of water, so the drop of that drop is 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:25.800
 This means that it becomes the fact that the birth of the cloud 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.990
 So what I mean for clothes is something that water drops have gathered 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.680
 Is floating in the sky 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.600
 In the clouds Well though we are floating in it is a lot of form empty reason this is floating the updraft 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.750
 Because it is supported by 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 Well, I mean, I can't get it down 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:55.290
 I say that the water drops that make up this cloud are crushed, but the mouth is also growing grain 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.140
 If it can not fall enough against the updraft 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.330
 It's not able to come Okkochi as the rain Toka snow 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.720
 Well then how large should the cloud crush be? 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.569
 It will be raining from your preparation too 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.549
 In Actually it means completely and coexist do this 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:22.430
 Seaplanes stick to ice crystals more and more 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:26.959
 So ice crystals are faster than things like supercooled water. 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.379
 It will grow, it will grow, it will be heavier 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.079
 Thus the festive final can have 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:42.420
 It is this kind of or cooling is water basis Toka other cloud particles when coming and raised in 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:45.990
 Rapid growth and growth by colliding and merging 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.210
 This was I So finally Okko I 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:58.080
 It is finally awakened as a perfume, but if it melts at that time 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:03:01.220
 The fact that to be final in the fall Tokere me waving to not be solved even though you will rain Bayutsu 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.220
 It will be 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:14.519
 I would like to introduce some of the mechanisms of heavy rain in practical skills courses 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.359
 A heavy rain is like heavy rain that is concentrated in a narrow area in a short time 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.000
 Says 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:23.099
 Now , let's say that the rain falling in a short time like this in the form of guerrilla heavy rain 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.050
 Though it is easy to end 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.740
 There are various causes for the occurrence of torrential rain 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.740
 There is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:40.360
 One but we'll look at one one one but in the cause of the occurrence of the state kitchen has a front line in the vicinity of Japan 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.370
 The second time in stagnation 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:50.460
 It is when the typhoon or landing or approaching 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.230
 In the third I think that I have heard even a weather forecast something 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.300
 Unstable atmosphere 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.180
 It is time when such a condition continues It is easy for concentration issue to occur 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:07.790
 It will be transported 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:08.659
 There is a risk that more dangerous phenomena may occur due to multiple causes. 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.560
 Right 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.990
 In the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:20.630
 I will see one by one 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:25.190
 It is the time when individual battle is stagnating in Japanese skin, but it is especially the end of the rainy season 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.990
 Pacific high pressure this summer high pressure but say this 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.590
 Is it is Pacific anticyclone 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.870
 It is not big come overhang towards Japan 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.460
 At that time a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:43.860
 Around this Enten of the Pacific Ocean anticyclone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:49.790
 Warm air was very wet will come this way into the south side of the front line 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:56.180
 If so , cumulonimbus clouds are likely to develop along the front 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:05:01.940
 Line in the You are an energy source It is the first place is the water vapor of Tteyuu remodeling 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:09.410
 Although there are clouds of typhoon is very of Tteyuu cloud of the central part 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:11.689
 Is I'm falling terrible rain of Tteyuu this woman of the vicinity of the center because it has sex high development 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.499
 Ne 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:23.299
 It's the third one, but I often hear that the atmospheric condition is unstable . 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:28.819
 But this is very cold air coming into the sky 

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:31.680
 Or very warm moist air comes into the virtual person 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:39.229
 In short cherry of the upper and lower 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.229
 If the temperature difference is large , the atmospheric condition will be unstable . 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:51.489
 Due to the temperature of this upper and lower air becoming higher, the upper air temperature is 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.519
 large 

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:59.990
 Heavy air processes the success 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:06:03.780
 The warm air below also rises as it is pushed up 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.590
 Because convection occurs in these places 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.240
 Securer sounds are a good place to develop 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:15.960
 In fact this is yeah 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.960
 It's in Tokyo, it's in the atmospheric condition unpressurized
