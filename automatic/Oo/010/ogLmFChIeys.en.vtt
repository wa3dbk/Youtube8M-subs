the nuances where they may not have

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
the nuances where they may not have
understood<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.710> before<00:00:41.100> i<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.940> quite<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
understood them before i was quite it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
been quite apparent to them that the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.850 
been quite apparent to them that the
spin<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> NBA<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:45.750> put<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.440> terms<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
spin that the NBA has put on in terms of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
spin that the NBA has put on in terms of
what<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.579> represented<00:00:48.180> contend<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
what they represented contend the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
what they represented contend the
proposal<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.950> quite<00:00:50.219> accurate<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
proposal is is not quite accurate and so

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
proposal is is not quite accurate and so
I<00:00:51.570> haven't<00:00:51.840> seen<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.469> having<00:00:52.800> us<00:00:52.920> walk<00:00:53.219> them

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I haven't seen it having us walk them

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
I haven't seen it having us walk them
through<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.090> explain<00:00:54.840> each<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> every

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

are clearly of the mind that it's an

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
are clearly of the mind that it's an
unacceptable<00:01:05.280> proposal<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
unacceptable proposal but because of

as you've as we told you many times

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
as you've as we told you many times
before<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:26.159> were<00:01:26.340> willing<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> compromise

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
before we were willing to compromise

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.240 
before we were willing to compromise
that<00:01:27.509> we've<00:01:27.780> compromised<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> economics

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that we've compromised on the economics

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.999 
that we've compromised on the economics
but<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.970> said<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:31.259> compromise

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but we said we would that compromise

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.999 
but we said we would that compromise
would<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.729> predicated<00:01:33.119> upon<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.259> ability<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
would be predicated upon the ability to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
would be predicated upon the ability to
get<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.060> thought<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.479> needed

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
get the things that we thought we needed

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
get the things that we thought we needed
within<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> system<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
within the system and that's what the
