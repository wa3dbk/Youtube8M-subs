00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
dollars in our pockets and so we kept

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.929 
dollars in our pockets and so we kept
backhoe<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.339> building<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> park

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
backhoe and just start building the park

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
backhoe and just start building the park
and<00:01:06.090> figured<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> buy<00:01:07.170> concrete<00:01:07.650> as

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and figured out how to buy concrete as

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
and figured out how to buy concrete as
we<00:01:07.950> built<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> park<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> started<00:01:10.110> with

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we built the park so you started with

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
we built the park so you started with
200<00:01:10.650> bucks<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.400> obviously<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.240> park

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
200 bucks and then obviously the park

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.789 
200 bucks and then obviously the park
costs<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.840> than<00:01:12.960> 200<00:01:13.290> bucks<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that the bikes would damage the park or

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.120 
that the bikes would damage the park or
thrash<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.820> or<00:02:02.030> maybe<00:02:03.020> danger<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.770> danger<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
thrash it or maybe danger and danger the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.370 
thrash it or maybe danger and danger the
people<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.670> park<00:02:05.050> but<00:02:06.050> then<00:02:06.200> you

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
people that are in the park but then you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.700 
people that are in the park but then you
later<00:02:07.040> decided<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:08.420> open<00:02:08.600> its<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.810> bike<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:09.200> what

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
we're all skaters who built it and
funded<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.070> that's<00:02:19.190> all<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:19.460> were

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
funded it and that's all we were

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.130 
funded it and that's all we were
thinking<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.710> we<00:02:21.710> were<00:02:21.740> skating<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.910> then

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
thinking and we were skating it and then

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.990 
thinking and we were skating it and then
BMX<00:02:24.140> guys<00:02:24.320> wanted<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.680> come<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.430> we

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
BMX guys wanted to come in and so we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.580 
BMX guys wanted to come in and so we
took<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.210> look<00:02:26.420> at<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.230> guys<00:02:27.350> came

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
took a look at that and you guys came

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
took a look at that and you guys came
down<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.950> started<00:02:28.070> flowing<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.610> park<00:02:28.820> it

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
down and started flowing the park it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.610 
down and started flowing the park it
looked<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:29.240> skating<00:02:29.600> does<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.140> bike<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.590> we

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
looked like skating does on bike so we

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.860 
looked like skating does on bike so we
said<00:02:31.370> sure<00:02:31.580> why<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:31.940> let<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.240> bikes<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
said sure why not let the bikes in and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 
said sure why not let the bikes in and
that's<00:02:33.860> kind<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> how<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.610> bikes<00:02:34.880> got

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
