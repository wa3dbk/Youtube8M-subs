00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
times I got in drag I went to a club in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.470 
times I got in drag I went to a club in
Boston<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.070> thought<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.270> most

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
Boston and I thought I was the most

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.770 
Boston and I thought I was the most
beautiful<00:02:52.990> girl<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.430> entire<00:02:54.460> world<00:02:55.000> I

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
beautiful girl in the entire world I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.900 
beautiful girl in the entire world I
thought<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.080> was<00:02:56.320> fish<00:02:56.680> even<00:02:57.490> though<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.700> didn't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
thought I was fish even though I didn't

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.610 
thought I was fish even though I didn't
know<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.120> fish<00:02:58.360> was<00:02:58.600> at<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> time<00:02:59.140> people

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
know what fish was at the time people

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.410 
know what fish was at the time people
were<00:02:59.830> telling<00:03:00.070> me<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:00.370> pretty<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.390> I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
were telling me how pretty I was but I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.060 
were telling me how pretty I was but I
think<00:03:01.540> that's<00:03:01.840> because<00:03:02.260> they<00:03:02.470> were<00:03:02.530> like

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
think that's because they were like

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.440 
think that's because they were like
three<00:03:03.310> sheets<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> wind<00:03:03.790> they<00:03:04.090> were<00:03:04.210> just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
three sheets to the wind they were just

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.479 
three sheets to the wind they were just
completely<00:03:04.630> racked<00:03:05.470> let's<00:03:05.920> apply<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> little

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
completely racked let's apply a little

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.180 
completely racked let's apply a little
contour<00:03:07.000> around<00:03:07.390> here<00:03:07.840> not<00:03:08.020> too<00:03:08.320> much<00:03:08.680> because

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
contour around here not too much because

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.470 
contour around here not too much because
then<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.580> would<00:03:09.640> look<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.300> what

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
then that would look like you know what

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.660 
then that would look like you know what
you're<00:03:10.630> doing<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.140> would<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.620> do<00:03:11.920> some<00:03:12.340> sort

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
you're doing I would just do some sort

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.960 
you're doing I would just do some sort
of<00:03:12.760> gross<00:03:13.150> cat<00:03:13.720> eye<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.530> pull<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.610> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
of gross cat eye I just pull it all the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.140 
of gross cat eye I just pull it all the
way<00:03:16.090> out<00:03:16.380> normal<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:18.420> mm-hmm

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
way out normal and like that mm-hmm

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.600 
way out normal and like that mm-hmm
beautiful<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.600> wish<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:23.320> had<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.100> white<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.580> I

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.370 
beautiful I wish I had the white that I
used<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.090> use<00:03:25.120> because<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> was<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> really

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
used to use because it was a really

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.370 
used to use because it was a really
frosty<00:03:27.070> white<00:03:27.280> which<00:03:28.180> doesn't<00:03:28.900> work<00:03:29.140> if<00:03:29.350> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380

under<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.630> eyebrow<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.709> then<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.340> would<00:03:36.640> just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
under that eyebrow and then I would just

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780 
under that eyebrow and then I would just
put<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.330> white<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:38.290> far<00:03:38.770> outside<00:03:39.340> where

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
put that white really far outside where

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.330 
put that white really far outside where

drying<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.620> lip<00:04:02.860> line<00:04:03.160> was<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.630> hardest<00:04:05.050> thing

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260

for<00:04:05.290> me<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.890> because<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.340> would<00:04:06.430> just<00:04:06.459> be

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
for me to do because it would just be

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.770 
for me to do because it would just be
all<00:04:07.150> all<00:04:07.959> outside<00:04:08.710> the
