00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.370 

and<00:01:23.940> there<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.680> fairly<00:01:25.680> dark<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:28.140> does

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and there it is fairly dark it does

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.740 
and there it is fairly dark it does
actually<00:01:28.619> farm<00:01:29.040> fairly<00:01:29.490> good<00:01:29.750> head<00:01:30.750> once<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
actually farm fairly good head once it's

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually farm fairly good head once it's
poured<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.020> bit<00:01:34.110> faster<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.659> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
poured a little bit faster but it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.180 
poured a little bit faster but it's
really<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> chocolatey<00:01:38.570> coffee

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
really got a lot of chocolatey coffee

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.990 
really got a lot of chocolatey coffee
type<00:01:41.190> flavors<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.240> bit<00:01:43.070> more<00:01:44.070> than<00:01:44.460> some

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
type flavors a little bit more than some

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.399 
type flavors a little bit more than some
of<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.299> normal<00:01:45.630> wrong<00:01:46.610> bales<00:01:48.080> but<00:01:49.080> I'm<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.259> big

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
of your normal wrong bales but I'm a big

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:02.219 
of your normal wrong bales but I'm a big
fan<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> brown<00:01:49.920> hills<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:53.840> we'll<00:01:54.840> see

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.749 

not<00:02:03.219> nearly<00:02:03.430> as<00:02:03.579> harsh<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.119> was<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:05.770> ten

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
not nearly as harsh as it was at ten

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
not nearly as harsh as it was at ten
days<00:02:07.000> when<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> first<00:02:07.750> opened<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.890> was

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
days when I first opened it it was

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.500 
days when I first opened it it was
surprisingly<00:02:11.830> had<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> lot<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.519> fizzle<00:02:13.150> out<00:02:13.360> of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
surprisingly had a lot of fizzle out of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.369 
surprisingly had a lot of fizzle out of
pop<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.620> then<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> lot<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> foam<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:16.810> ten<00:02:17.170> days

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
pop to it then a lot of foam at ten days

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.759 
pop to it then a lot of foam at ten days
so<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> reviews<00:02:19.660> said<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.470> you

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
so a lot of the reviews said that you

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.960 
so a lot of the reviews said that you
know<00:02:21.510> two<00:02:22.510> weeks<00:02:22.720> no<00:02:23.200> fizz<00:02:23.760> three<00:02:24.760> weeks

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
know two weeks no fizz three weeks

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.680 
know two weeks no fizz three weeks
slight<00:02:25.720> fizz<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.980> sort<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.340> thing<00:02:27.519> but<00:02:28.450> mine

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
slight fizz that sort of thing but mine

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.809 
slight fizz that sort of thing but mine
was<00:02:29.610> fairly<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:30.760> carved<00:02:31.510> at<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:32.019> point<00:02:32.819> and

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
was fairly well carved at that point and

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.030 
was fairly well carved at that point and
that's<00:02:34.090> what<00:02:34.269> they<00:02:34.390> said<00:02:34.630> with<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> wild

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that's what they said with the wild

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.289 
that's what they said with the wild
yeast<00:02:36.340> strain<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.420> there<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:38.019> some<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.769> there

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
yeast strain if there was some in there

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.300 
yeast strain if there was some in there
which<00:02:40.299> could<00:02:40.540> possibly<00:02:40.690> be<00:02:41.079> maybe<00:02:41.950> as<00:02:42.130> whack

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
which could possibly be maybe as whack

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.770 
which could possibly be maybe as whack
carved<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.910> bit<00:02:43.239> faster<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:45.630> anyway<00:02:46.630> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
carved a bit faster so anyway it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.449 
carved a bit faster so anyway it's
really<00:02:47.019> good<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.709> really<00:02:47.860> nice<00:02:48.130> color<00:02:50.459> nice

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
really good it's really nice color nice

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.899 
really good it's really nice color nice
deep

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
deep

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.629 
deep
reddish<00:02:53.840> brown<00:02:54.200> hue<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:58.340> getting

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
reddish brown hue to it but it's getting

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.839 
reddish brown hue to it but it's getting
better<00:02:58.819> with<00:02:59.030> time<00:02:59.239> so<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> haven't<00:03:01.670> had<00:03:01.790> a

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
better with time so but I haven't had a

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.500 
better with time so but I haven't had a
couple<00:03:02.180> bottles<00:03:02.329> I've<00:03:02.659> opened<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.290> just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
