do I play the game remote play so that
answer<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.019> kind<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.560> two<00:03:53.709> toned<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.730> my

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
answer is kind of two toned in my

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.599 
answer is kind of two toned in my
opinion<00:03:55.420> at<00:03:55.600> least<00:03:55.780> I'm<00:03:55.989> gonna<00:03:56.170> say<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:57.220> you

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
opinion at least I'm gonna say if you

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.610 
opinion at least I'm gonna say if you
prefer<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.150> have<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.660> FIFA<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.410> is

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
prefer to have a FIFA that is

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.680 
prefer to have a FIFA that is
consistently<00:04:00.459> on<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.730> go<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.389> can<00:04:01.420> take

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
consistently on the go so you can take

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.420 
consistently on the go so you can take
it<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:01.989> say<00:04:02.290> you're<00:04:02.500> traveling<00:04:03.340> to

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
it with you say you're traveling to

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.039 
it with you say you're traveling to
school<00:04:03.849> or<00:04:04.209> whatever<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.630> case<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.959> I'm

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
school or whatever the case is I'm

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.650 
school or whatever the case is I'm
trying<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.260> remember<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.500> controls<00:04:05.769> here

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
trying to remember the controls here

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.120 
trying to remember the controls here
then<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.690> would<00:04:07.930> say<00:04:08.079> go<00:04:08.290> ahead<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.560> pick<00:04:08.950> up

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
then I would say go ahead and pick up

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.610 
then I would say go ahead and pick up
FIFA<00:04:09.760> 15<00:04:10.329> legacy<00:04:10.989> edition<00:04:11.200> or<00:04:11.290> maybe<00:04:11.530> even

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
FIFA 15 legacy edition or maybe even

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.789 
FIFA 15 legacy edition or maybe even
pick<00:04:12.489> up<00:04:12.639> FIFA<00:04:13.389> 14<00:04:13.720> because<00:04:14.200> pretty<00:04:14.620> much

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
pick up FIFA 14 because pretty much

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.439 
pick up FIFA 14 because pretty much
they're<00:04:15.009> the<00:04:15.250> exact<00:04:15.639> same<00:04:15.850> game<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.299> can

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
they're the exact same game and you can

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.099 
they're the exact same game and you can
probably<00:04:16.690> save<00:04:17.049> some<00:04:17.290> money<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.620> you

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
probably save some money if you

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.929 
probably save some money if you
are<00:04:19.199> one<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.949> you<00:04:20.099> don't<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.639> play<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:20.939 
are one that you don't really play the

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.520 
are one that you don't really play the
game<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.359> know<00:04:21.479> out<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.810> about<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.349> want

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
game you know out and about but you want

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.230 
game you know out and about but you want
to<00:04:22.620> play<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:22.949> home<00:04:23.219> then<00:04:23.759> I<00:04:23.849> would<00:04:24.030> simply

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
to play it out home then I would simply

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.230 
to play it out home then I would simply
say<00:04:24.569> to<00:04:24.599> you<00:04:25.189> maybe<00:04:26.189> play<00:04:26.550> remote<00:04:27.000> play

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
say to you maybe play remote play

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.790 
say to you maybe play remote play
because<00:04:27.599> honestly<00:04:28.080> you're<00:04:28.259> getting<00:04:28.650> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
because honestly you're getting the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.399 
because honestly you're getting the
actual<00:04:28.979> console<00:04:29.789> experience<00:04:30.259> versus<00:04:31.259> a

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
actual console experience versus a

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.610 
actual console experience versus a
handheld<00:04:31.949> experience<00:04:36.050> it's<00:04:37.050> been<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.439> long

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
handheld experience it's been so long

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.140 
handheld experience it's been so long
since<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.039> play<00:04:38.189> the<00:04:38.340> video<00:04:38.639> edition<00:04:38.969> of<00:04:39.060> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
since I play the video edition of the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.360 
since I play the video edition of the
game<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.599> it's<00:04:39.719> sad<00:04:39.930> because<00:04:39.960> EA<00:04:40.590> really<00:04:41.099> you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
game and it's sad because EA really you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.800 
game and it's sad because EA really you
know<00:04:41.460> doesn't<00:04:41.789> listen<00:04:41.969> to<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.210> consumer<00:04:42.659> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
know doesn't listen to the consumer I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.510 
know doesn't listen to the consumer I
think<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.379> reality<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:43.949> situation<00:04:44.099> is

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
think the reality of the situation is

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.469 
think the reality of the situation is
they're<00:04:44.729> making<00:04:44.969> their<00:04:45.090> money<00:04:45.180> on<00:04:45.389> the

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
they're making their money on the

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.999 
they're making their money on the
console<00:04:45.900> they're<00:04:46.020> only<00:04:46.229> making<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:46.889> the

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
console they're only making it for the

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.450 
console they're only making it for the
Vita<00:04:47.360> simply<00:04:48.360> because<00:04:48.979> you<00:04:49.979> know<00:04:50.099> printer

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
Vita simply because you know printer

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.189 
Vita simply because you know printer
licensing<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.300> whatnot<00:04:51.569> so<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:51.810> don't<00:04:52.110> really

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
licensing and whatnot so I don't really

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.749 
licensing and whatnot so I don't really
think<00:04:52.379> there's<00:04:52.680> incentive<00:04:53.159> for<00:04:53.279> them<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.610> do

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
think there's incentive for them to do

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.189 
think there's incentive for them to do
anything<00:04:53.789> with<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.509> game<00:04:54.689> and<00:04:54.870> that's<00:04:54.930> why

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
anything with the game and that's why

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.929 
anything with the game and that's why
they<00:04:55.349> never<00:04:55.500> really<00:04:55.800> update<00:04:56.129> it<00:04:56.219> but<00:04:56.699> when<00:04:56.819> you

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
they never really update it but when you

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.249 
they never really update it but when you
look<00:04:57.150> at<00:04:57.270> things<00:04:57.449> like<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.689> mobile<00:04:57.900> edition

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
look at things like the mobile edition

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.689 
look at things like the mobile edition
of<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.409> game<00:04:58.529> which<00:04:58.680> does<00:04:59.009> have<00:04:59.219> ultimate

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
of the game which does have ultimate

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.300 
of the game which does have ultimate
team<00:04:59.849> it<00:05:00.300> really<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.840> huge<00:05:01.379> disappointment

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
team it really is a huge disappointment

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.369 
team it really is a huge disappointment
I<00:05:04.849> mean<00:05:05.849> you<00:05:05.939> could<00:05:06.090> do<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.210> on<00:05:06.389> mobile<00:05:06.629> my
