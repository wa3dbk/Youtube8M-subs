there's another one on this side and as

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160 
there's another one on this side and as
screw<00:00:41.339> has<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.640> come<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.989> we're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
screw has to come out we're going to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
screw has to come out we're going to
take<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> side<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.220> is<00:00:44.339> where<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
take the side out that this is where the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
take the side out that this is where the
cd-rom<00:00:44.909> is<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> side<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.260> that's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cd-rom is on this side also so that's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
cd-rom is on this side also so that's
why<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.920> selected<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:48.149> side<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> take

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
why I have selected this side to take

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
why I have selected this side to take
off<00:00:48.809> hoping<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> hard<00:00:49.559> drives<00:00:49.739> under

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
off hoping that the hard drives under

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
off hoping that the hard drives under
there<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.340> did<00:00:50.579> preview<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.840> make

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
there now I did preview this to make

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.450 
there now I did preview this to make
sure<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.649> memories<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.250> other

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
sure it is the memories on this other

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
sure it is the memories on this other
side<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:54.989> thing<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
side so I just do the same thing on the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
side so I just do the same thing on the
other<00:00:55.559> side<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.460> memory<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.879> ever

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
other side to get the memory if you ever

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
other side to get the memory if you ever
want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.359> upgrade<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:58.020> change<00:00:58.050> out<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> memory

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
want to upgrade or change out the memory

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.180 
want to upgrade or change out the memory
and<00:00:59.329> what<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.039> we're<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and what we want to do is we're going to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
and what we want to do is we're going to
pry<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.519> pry<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.420> no<00:01:03.840> worries<00:01:04.110> about

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
pry it pry this off no worries about

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
pry it pry this off no worries about
that<00:01:04.379> they'll<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:04.860> back<00:01:06.080> pry<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.289> off<00:01:08.119> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that they'll go back pry that off and
