00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.299
 hello everyone today from cooking tricks 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.510
 let's learn how to use molds 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.789
 silicone that allow us to save because 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.880
 can be washed and stored in one 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.550
 again for that we're going to use the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.599
 trick of our friend gabriela 10 that 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 taught us to use the molds right to the 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.320
 time to buy them 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.810
 Well they leave a smell and some flavor 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.650
 for that we wash them with a little bit of 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.340
 warm water and a little soap care 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.030
 do not use thick scourers or that are 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.550
 close to sharp knives then another 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.760
 of the tricks Gabriela taught us is 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.640
 that the tiny molds slip through 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.949
 the dishwasher then the ideal is 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.250
 scrub one by one after having them 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.649
 used if we do not want to be stuck 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.370
 cupcake or the cupcake when we are 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.820
 Baking can be used 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.650
 paper molds that cover the mold 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.860
 silicone 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.510
 use the trick of butter with a 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.810
 napkin 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.870
 and the mold we spread of margarine or 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.870
 Butter 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.170
 when we have everything well covered what 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.100
 we leave on the metal mold 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.790
 or we can sprinkle a little bit 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.790
 Of flour 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.320
 and so what we are about 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.600
 and then we turn it over again and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.540
 we have the mold prepared so that 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 stick 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.020
 a very important fact is the heat and the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.810
 cold that support silicone molds 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.610
 neither above 240 degrees nor by 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 below 40 degrees if they do not lose shape 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 They leave taste and leave an odor in the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.050
 pastry we prepare this has been 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.050
 all for today thank you very much
