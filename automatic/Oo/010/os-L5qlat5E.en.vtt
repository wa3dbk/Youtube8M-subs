just taking my red marker and going over
the<00:00:49.890> white<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> you're<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the white and you're probably gonna have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
the white and you're probably gonna have
to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> couple<00:00:51.629> coats<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> red<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> make

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to do a couple coats of the red to make

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200 
to do a couple coats of the red to make
it<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.010> stand<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.940> pretty

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it really stand out and this is pretty

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
it really stand out and this is pretty
much<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> technique<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.260> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
much the technique you're going to be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
much the technique you're going to be
using<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> rest<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> show<00:00:56.520> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
using for the rest of the show just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.459 
using for the rest of the show just
remember<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.750> white<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> then

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.890 

and<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.670> basic<00:01:15.970> pattern<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:16.570> shirt<00:01:16.780> is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
and the basic pattern for the shirt is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.330 
and the basic pattern for the shirt is
just<00:01:17.080> like<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.260> bunch<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.620> squiggles<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.190> like

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
just like a bunch of squiggles and like

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.130 
just like a bunch of squiggles and like
zigzags<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.060> just<00:01:19.210> abstract<00:01:19.630> lines<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
zigzags and just abstract lines and this

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.870 
zigzags and just abstract lines and this
is<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.680> completed<00:01:24.040> front<00:01:24.400> side<00:01:24.610> looks

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
just flip it over and do the same thing

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:47.400
