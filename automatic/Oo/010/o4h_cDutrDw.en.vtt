00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and oh guys this is following 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.620
 I hope you all go very very 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.480
 well end up today for the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.429
 presentation of some dribbler on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 was 16 of course this dribbler are 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 very well known I will not say that here 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 it's revelations and so on and they 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.389
 were present in the last hurdles 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 fifa 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 then you can tell me in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
 comment what kind of player you 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.519
 want to see for the next episode 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 that is, the big strikes the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.550
 big and small to and any 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.289
 what you tell me and you tell me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 also which players you want to see from 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 this category is then here it is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 probably not his cards on was from 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.390
 16 who will be there who will be 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.739
 present simply because it is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.300
 someone who created them for me 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 Besides, I thank him and his twitter 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.550
 and its youtube punch are in the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.590
 description 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 so thanks to him and so these are these 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 cards are probably not the one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.030
 that there will be on hogwrap 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 I warn you we start everything from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 continued with hbo asia 4th 22 general 90 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.520
 in speed 79 years draws 80 years pass 90 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 87-year dream physical and necessarily 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 the five stars of technical gesture 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 of course this stage it's me who have them 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 put so it will not necessarily be his 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 stats there that will be on the map of 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.860
 beautiful asia in was she but here I am 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.659
 I told myself that considering his season all 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 what he did the drinks he has etc. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.060
 his stats might be possible for 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 him and it would be really very very 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 interesting to have this map on 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.659
 chain with chirat yes so 76.2 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.900
 general 84 years speed 74 years shot 86 87 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.520
 years dream and 71 in physics a map 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 rather interesting especially chikaoui 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 it's still a very, very 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.579
 used for quite some time on 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.210
 escape since he has his five stars of 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.810
 technical moves 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 so here is very very technical irl I 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.270
 think he's really deserving of these 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 five stars of technical gestures and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.149
 this card would really be very 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.400
 interesting and I think that would cost 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.980
 quite expensive from the start trippant 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.130
 the third player is cuadrado who 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.760
 would have 84.2 general with 93 in speed 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 78 shots 77 years pass 90 in dribbling and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.060
 73 in physics 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.580
 it would be a just tremendous card 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.230
 very very interesting for bpl 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.640
 frankly the five gesture stars and 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.470
 bing it would be really huge 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 so I think this player is very 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.430
 very very very expensive if the abbot this 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 card but I think quadra giving 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.940
 cays will be expensive in fact 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 chain with two leaves that was 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.440
 transferred to manchester united 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.830
 at the very beginning of the transfer window with 80.2 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.980
 general 92 in speed 79 years old pulls 73 years 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.830
 spend 87 years dream and 78.2 physics 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.510
 it's really really interesting 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.580
 and I think it's a map that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.050
 would be very expensive from the beginning since 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.940
 here are the stadiums are just enormously 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.070
 is very complete the fifth player 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.459
 this is ricardo quaresma the right striker 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.310
 of porto he would have 82 general 80.3 in 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.620
 speed 75 years draws 77 years pass 85 in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.880
 dribbling and 65 years old physically this would 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.230
 a very interesting map 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 since that of barrels of 15 months I 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.980
 loved personally very very complete 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.840
 so frankly very interesting 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.860
 as a map and in addition we will be able to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.360
 put in the same team as the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160
 next player who is also very 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.070
 interesting he the sixth and last 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.650
 player this is adel taarabt the player so 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.810
 who just signed for free or sl 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 benfica so imagined a team with 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.260
 nani left in offensive medium taraabt 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.480
 and in the middle right 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.450
 quaresma that would be just enormously the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.360
 guy so he would have 79 speed 73's of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.760
 shot 73 2 passes 4.25 of dribbles and 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.200
 only 62 of fizi but that's with the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 5 stars of technical gestures tarab on 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.280
 know in fifa it's a safe bet 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.989
 after that it's true that all these 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.910
 transfers there that have been to milan and and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.140
 will even terra queens park rangers I 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.610
 believe he put that only 5 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.830
 goals and 3 assists a trick like 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.730
 it's really bad for the player 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.160
 that he could be 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.540
 well here and it's quite a shame but 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.340
 in fifa it's a safe bet and I 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.989
 think we're really having fun with this 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 day if you liked this video do not hesitate 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.739
 not to comment by telling me what type 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.360
 of player that you would like to see so I 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.769
 repeat for example the players with a 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.870
 big hitting players large 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.840
 the small days and you can also 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.830
 secular and video and subscribers 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.690
 the chain if it's not already done and 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.620
 I'll see you soon for 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.620
 new videos hi
