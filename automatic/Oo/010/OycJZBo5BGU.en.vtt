 me one 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.210
 nice to keep clean 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 because it fit it is also about PR 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.349
 200 euros 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.669
 cheap but still a poem chic Profitlich everyone see immediately 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.419
 If mans big boxes can be very valuable for them 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.010
 not necessarily easy was so 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.220
 also this time what you do and have 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 Schuberts as already said that he also see it percent 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.200
 chic design how is actually all lie used 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 were buried with different epic poems 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.699
 we will also be throttled in Europe 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.200
 use external bonds 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.840
 we have two times 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.600
 Percent 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.530
 not on 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 at least something like that 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 Aham AG table 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.460
 Weißtal is also disputed whether it is exactly 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 For that they should use workers on too which one can 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.610
 who are also from the Union 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 decided here 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.950
 if it does not succeed 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 not quite 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.880
 So express possibilities, she says 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.829
 and if necessary 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.440
 now it can be closed 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.420
 and looks really pretty 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.900
 nothing is pressed and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.280
 that is also very stable with the man but you will also 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.729
 one would have to express oneself 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.800
 It should not really be that far, but we have it too 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.220
 right there and on the spot 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 8 chances better what we need 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 Rank three also shared a user horny 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.180
 Percent sung in two languages ​​German and English 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.930
 this mixture is French subject 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.940
 on the back side 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.780
 high-quality connection cable gilded 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 that's what we do 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.250
 really bad 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.620
 to charge the big screen for swimming lessons 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.930
 or a little longer 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.880
 if one 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.710
 is but wants to connect to the computer and some new capital 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.199
 would like to have 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.849
 which is bigger than expected 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.959
 respectively 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.299
 1 b 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.630
 Pad did not match 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.869
 Apple 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.309
 simply here European cities sat down then 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.629
 this must be written to and we have an issue of up to approx 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.619
 550 billion francs 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.370
 and I disappeared yesterday but that's going to be charged 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.879
 Employee representative on his own there is really 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.569
 also on the 11th 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.669
 here again the complete surprise 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.329
 and that's what they are 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.169
 did not want to know anything 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.349
 I am touring growing diversity 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.200
 Boxing is very fancy and when we take our Samsung offline 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.810
 Use percent could make that easy by going up here on the terrain page 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 Isa middle position sends 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.279
 the TuS already heard what happens when you Mio 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.869
 or still on it 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.659
 why r 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.920
 with said as before the battery it has us out of the state forest but has 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.559
 you can still romp 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:15.319
 with a volume adjust and before that probably already on the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.179
 The back is a do not know even if «The taboo largest 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.750
 risks 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.609
 on the side are apparently the 2 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.189
 speaker 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.590
 and we've just believed Max Ballauf's SEC antibodies see the connectors 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.139
 if it is connected already 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.089
 but also because I have already done that from the southern one 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:34.000
 Quick you just have to pull this slider up here so hold 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.340
 and thus already recognized 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.340
 Bluetooth is already implemented Frederike 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.849
 then you could hear the beautiful songs 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.949
 but Thomas Warndorf strength 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.089
 at the Samsung appearance 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.809
 it is still a bit further down turn 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.589
 if I already go out then immediately shot on the phone on the McCanns 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.839
 Now there is only one glue Bender left and without Steag it has become so firm 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.679
 H 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.790
 So it's a bit different because we are light years 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.879
 what the students 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.099
 Benaissa is supposed to do it immediately 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.129
 H 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.599
 especially the performance 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.419
 Traders and it there with him a few seconds then ever 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.239
 tried tested 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.080
 23 16 Jul 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.129
 the viewer takes v that was the idea Gero Boston counters could 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.370
 which answer is at Burgsee 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.830
 and briefly first or with other or headphones speakers too 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.180
 soon compared slightly cheaper area 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.610
 but denied buy recommendation where it is still difficult to buy 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.249
