00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
but i hadn't made one in the last couple

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.150 
but i hadn't made one in the last couple
of<00:00:32.309> days<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.320> damn<00:00:34.320> thing<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:36.890> came<00:00:37.890> up

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of days and that damn thing just came up

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.979 
of days and that damn thing just came up
and<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> said<00:00:38.489> operating<00:00:38.969> system<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.390> found<00:00:39.540> i

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and it said operating system not found i

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
and it said operating system not found i
had<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> reinstall<00:00:40.559> everything<00:00:41.010> lost<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
had to reinstall everything lost that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.290 
had to reinstall everything lost that
paper<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> began<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.850> look<00:00:44.940> around<00:00:45.180> for

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
paper and so I began to look around for

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.209 
paper and so I began to look around for
another<00:00:45.480> solution<00:00:45.930> unfortunately<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
another solution unfortunately I have a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180 
another solution unfortunately I have a
lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> money<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> had<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.649> settle

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
lot of money so I had to kind of settle

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
lot of money so I had to kind of settle
with<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> computer<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.539> someone<00:00:52.110> gave<00:00:52.260> me

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
with the computer that someone gave me

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.389 
with the computer that someone gave me
it<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.739> old<00:00:52.860> boot<00:00:53.520> beige<00:00:53.940> g3<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.590> had<00:00:55.739> 9.2

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it was an old boot beige g3 you had 9.2

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.830 
it was an old boot beige g3 you had 9.2
on<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.579> got<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.940> dealt<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.180> 9.2

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
on it and just I got it I dealt with 9.2

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.560 
on it and just I got it I dealt with 9.2
and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.230> eventually<00:01:01.500> went<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> got

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
and then I eventually went and got

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
and then I eventually went and got
Jaguar<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> loaded<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
experience and I had that computer for

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
experience and I had that computer for
about<00:01:33.329> we've<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.229> six<00:01:34.530> months<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.860> something

about we've got six months or something
one<00:01:35.970> day<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> booted<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.409> didn't

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
one day I booted it up and it didn't

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
one day I booted it up and it didn't
work<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.329> didn't<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.049> didn't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
work out but I didn't you know I didn't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.749 
work out but I didn't you know I didn't
fret<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> i<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> computers<00:01:41.670> from

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
fret over it i mean that computers from

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
fret over it i mean that computers from
1998<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.600> something<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.990> 99<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
1998 or something like that 99 and it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
1998 or something like that 99 and it
was<00:01:44.579> 2004<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.420> happened<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> mean

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
was 2004 when this happened so I mean

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.460 
was 2004 when this happened so I mean
that's<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.649> pretty<00:01:46.829> good<00:01:46.979> run<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.159> computer<00:01:48.470> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that's a pretty good run for computer so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
that's a pretty good run for computer so
times<00:01:49.890> were<00:01:50.040> tough<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.430> didn't<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.700> any<00:01:50.850> money

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
times were tough I didn't have any money

myself I got it about a month before the
Intel<00:02:08.940> once<00:02:09.119> came<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.709> at

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
Intel once came in and I don't know at

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
a while I loved it because I could do at

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
fine but when the Intel once came out

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.600
