so now that I've shown you how to make a

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.300 
so now that I've shown you how to make a
ganache<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.630> my<00:00:22.750> test<00:00:23.020> kitchen<00:00:23.380> let's<00:00:24.070> go<00:00:24.220> in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
ganache in my test kitchen let's go in

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.130 
ganache in my test kitchen let's go in
the<00:00:24.400> chocolate<00:00:24.759> factory<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.330> discover<00:00:25.840> all

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
the chocolate factory and discover all

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.380 
the chocolate factory and discover all
the<00:00:26.320> steps<00:00:26.619> it<00:00:26.860> takes<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.699> make<00:00:27.730> all<00:00:28.180> these

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
the steps it takes to make all these

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.440 
the steps it takes to make all these
wonderful

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.110 

so<00:00:33.140> here<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:33.650> are<00:00:33.830> coming<00:00:34.400> out<00:00:34.550> from<00:00:34.760> my<00:00:34.850> test

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
so here we are coming out from my test

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.090 
so here we are coming out from my test
kitchen<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:35.660> right<00:00:36.080> here<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.650> larger

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
kitchen and right here in the larger

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.700 
kitchen and right here in the larger
production<00:00:37.850> kitchen<00:00:38.300> where<00:00:39.050> will<00:00:39.260> upscale

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
production kitchen where will upscale

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.010 
production kitchen where will upscale
the<00:00:39.980> recipes<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:40.790> made<00:00:41.150> a<00:00:41.180> small<00:00:41.540> batch<00:00:41.750> of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the recipes so I made a small batch of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.830 
the recipes so I made a small batch of
224<00:00:42.530> pounds<00:00:42.710> in<00:00:43.100> here<00:00:43.880> will<00:00:44.150> be<00:00:44.450> banking

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
224 pounds in here will be banking

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680 
224 pounds in here will be banking
batches<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.470> 40<00:00:46.160> pounds<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.550> up<00:00:46.730> but<00:00:47.450> still

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
batches of 40 pounds and up but still

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.900 
batches of 40 pounds and up but still
paying<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.200> lot<00:00:48.410> of<00:00:48.559> attention<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.040> details<00:00:49.580> in

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
paying a lot of attention to details in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.240 
paying a lot of attention to details in
how<00:00:50.420> we<00:00:50.480> mix<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.989> ingredients<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:51.650> how<00:00:52.190> we

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
how we mix the ingredients and how we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.570 
how we mix the ingredients and how we
prepare<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:53.540> ganache<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.890> once<00:00:55.130> we've<00:00:55.340> made

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
prepare this ganache so once we've made

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.690 
prepare this ganache so once we've made
those<00:00:55.790> large-scale<00:00:56.510> batches<00:00:57.290> of<00:00:57.440> ganache<00:00:57.800> we

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
those large-scale batches of ganache we

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.770 
those large-scale batches of ganache we
simply<00:00:59.140> rolled<00:01:00.140> them<00:01:00.350> into<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.830> tube<00:01:01.130> shape<00:01:01.160> and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
simply rolled them into a tube shape and

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.870 
simply rolled them into a tube shape and
slide<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.020> tube<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.410> ganache<00:01:03.770> into<00:01:04.640> our

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
slide this tube of ganache into our

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.210 
slide this tube of ganache into our
extruder<00:01:05.360> right<00:01:05.570> here<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.259> this<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.680> simply<00:01:07.100> a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
extruder right here and this is simply a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.140 
extruder right here and this is simply a
machine<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:08.479> sizes<00:01:09.170> even<00:01:09.950> parts<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.610> ganache

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
machine that sizes even parts of ganache

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.140 
machine that sizes even parts of ganache
for<00:01:11.690> us<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.050> be<00:01:12.170> balling<00:01:12.680> into<00:01:13.100> truffles<00:01:13.910> or

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
for us to be balling into truffles or

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.140 
for us to be balling into truffles or
some<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.930> our<00:01:15.080> creator<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.460> ganache<00:01:16.759> as<00:01:16.970> we

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
some of our creator so the ganache as we

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.480 
some of our creator so the ganache as we
just<00:01:17.330> extruded<00:01:17.869> in<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.590> case<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.070> Bailey's

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
just extruded in this case the Bailey's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.820 
just extruded in this case the Bailey's
need<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.420> rest<00:01:20.660> for<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.960> few<00:01:21.020> hours<00:01:21.170> before

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
need to rest for a few hours before

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.940 
need to rest for a few hours before
being<00:01:22.190> shaped<00:01:22.490> into<00:01:22.729> truffles<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.200> piece

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
being shaped into truffles so this piece

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
being shaped into truffles so this piece
of<00:01:25.130> ganache<00:01:25.520> will<00:01:26.270> be<00:01:26.479> balled<00:01:27.110> up

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899 

flattened<00:01:30.540> lightly<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.860> set<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> disc

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
flattened lightly and then set on a disc

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:46.100 
flattened lightly and then set on a disc
of<00:01:33.090> chocolate<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.479> perfect

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.440 

you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.630 

so<00:01:51.450> these<00:01:51.659> Bailey's<00:01:52.229> ganaches<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:52.950> ready<00:01:53.280> for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so these Bailey's ganaches are ready for

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
so these Bailey's ganaches are ready for
in<00:01:53.760> robbing<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.330> robbing<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.440> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
in robbing and robbing is really the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.010 
in robbing and robbing is really the
action<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> covering<00:01:56.670> each<00:01:57.240> piece<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.690> ganache

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
action of covering each piece of ganache

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620 
action of covering each piece of ganache
with<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> coating<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.010> chocolate<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.300> I'll<00:02:00.390> just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
with a coating of chocolate so I'll just

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.210 
with a coating of chocolate so I'll just
set<00:02:00.900> these<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:02.090> our<00:02:03.090> conveyor<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.100> some<00:02:05.100> of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
set these on our conveyor and some of

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.370 
set these on our conveyor and some of
our<00:02:05.310> truffles<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:06.000> dipped<00:02:06.390> by<00:02:06.630> hands<00:02:07.050> such<00:02:07.229> as

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
our truffles are dipped by hands such as

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.010 
our truffles are dipped by hands such as
most<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> critters<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.780> some<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> these

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
most of the critters and some of these

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.710 
most of the critters and some of these
round<00:02:10.410> truffles<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:11.220> perfectly<00:02:11.880> adapted<00:02:12.090> for

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
round truffles are perfectly adapted for

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.090 
round truffles are perfectly adapted for
in<00:02:13.110> roaming<00:02:13.560> which<00:02:14.280> gives<00:02:14.550> us<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:15.120> perfect

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
in roaming which gives us a perfect

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.190 
in roaming which gives us a perfect
coating<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.190> chocolate<00:02:17.670> every<00:02:18.209> time

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
coating of chocolate every time

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.620 
coating of chocolate every time
let's<00:02:21.190> set<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.730> motion

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
let's set it in motion

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:49.100 
let's set it in motion
and<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.770> way<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> go<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:25.970> Rover

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.350 

so<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.319> we<00:02:50.440> are<00:02:50.620> at<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> final<00:02:51.460> steps<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.090> our

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
so here we are at the final steps of our

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.480 
so here we are at the final steps of our
Bailey's<00:02:52.750> truffle<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:54.010> trick<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
Bailey's truffle the trick is to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.199 
Bailey's truffle the trick is to
decorate<00:02:55.480> each<00:02:55.720> one<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.020> them<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.740> nice

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
decorate each one of them with a nice

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.330 
decorate each one of them with a nice
straight<00:02:58.209> line<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.750> dark<00:02:58.959> chocolate<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.620> then

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
straight line of dark chocolate and then

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.760 
straight line of dark chocolate and then
just<00:03:00.610> finish<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.150> off<00:03:01.300> with<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.630> speck<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.260> pure

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
just finish it off with a speck of pure
