more<00:02:01.380> cracking<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.860> inside<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
more cracking up inside it as you can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.679 
more cracking up inside it as you can
see<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> ferrule<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.540> there

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
see there is a ferrule bit in there

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.249 
see there is a ferrule bit in there
anyway<00:02:04.369> fairly<00:02:05.369> easy<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> take<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:06.049> all<00:02:07.049> these

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
anyway fairly easy to take off all these

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.520 
anyway fairly easy to take off all these
bolts<00:02:07.500> running<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> edges<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.530> came

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
bolts running the edges here and came

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.839 
bolts running the edges here and came
off<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:10.920> piece<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.430> split<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.700> down

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
off in one piece you can split it down

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.020 
off in one piece you can split it down
the<00:02:11.910> middle<00:02:12.000> by<00:02:12.300> taking

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the middle by taking

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.360 
the middle by taking
front<00:02:13.240> part<00:02:13.420> wearing<00:02:13.840> eggs<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.740> I've<00:02:14.950> left<00:02:15.130> in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
front part wearing eggs but I've left in

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.190 
front part wearing eggs but I've left in
for<00:02:15.610> general<00:02:16.090> purposes<00:02:16.510> he<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.930> got<00:02:17.050> take

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
for general purposes he just got take

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.090 
for general purposes he just got take
the<00:02:17.290> screws<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.680> hence<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> gap<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:20.100> so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
the screws out hence the gap there so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.780 
the screws out hence the gap there so
what<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.340> oils<00:02:21.640> draining<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.790> sump

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
what that oils draining this is the sump

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.740 
what that oils draining this is the sump
bunk<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.910> one<00:02:28.600> thing

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
bunk as you can see just that one thing

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750 
bunk as you can see just that one thing
I<00:02:28.840> will<00:02:28.990> point<00:02:29.020> out<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.640> end

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
I will point out this bit on the end

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.010 
I will point out this bit on the end
here

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
here

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.809 
here
mine<00:02:32.680> came<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.130> was<00:02:33.160> rounded<00:02:33.610> that's

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
mine came out and it was rounded that's

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.210 
mine came out and it was rounded that's
actually<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> magnet<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.680> Spike's<00:02:35.980> done

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
actually a magnet this Spike's done

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.570 
actually a magnet this Spike's done
9,000<00:02:37.090> miles<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.569> there<00:02:38.350> was<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> fair<00:02:39.280> little

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
9,000 miles and there was a fair little

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.220 
9,000 miles and there was a fair little
bitter<00:02:39.730> metal<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> end<00:02:40.660> there<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:40.930> just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
bitter metal on the end there so just

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.020 
bitter metal on the end there so just
just<00:02:41.470> be<00:02:41.560> careful<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.400> know<00:02:42.459> make<00:02:42.640> sure<00:02:42.850> you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
doing so I'm not going to go all into

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.390 
doing so I'm not going to go all into
that<00:03:08.730> next<00:03:09.730> thing<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.000> got<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.239> do<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:11.400> remove

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
that next thing I got to do is remove

that next thing I got to do is remove
the<00:03:13.050> HT<00:03:14.050> leads<00:03:14.850> okay<00:03:15.850> spark<00:03:16.600> plugs<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.230> on

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the HT leads okay spark plugs this is on

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.490 
the HT leads okay spark plugs this is on
the<00:03:17.410> same<00:03:17.680> earlier<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> NGK<00:03:19.239> spark<00:03:19.500> plug

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
the same earlier is the NGK spark plug

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.009 
the same earlier is the NGK spark plug
end<00:03:20.709> cap<00:03:21.150> pretty<00:03:22.150> decent<00:03:22.510> unit<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.870> can

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
end cap pretty decent unit as you can

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.810 
end cap pretty decent unit as you can
see<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.500> straight<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.340> comparison<00:03:24.790> to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
see it's straight as in comparison to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.380 
see it's straight as in comparison to
the<00:03:24.970> other<00:03:25.090> one<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.360> was<00:03:25.480> bent<00:03:25.769> now<00:03:27.390> here

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
the other one which was bent now here

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.550 
the other one which was bent now here
that's<00:03:28.690> obviously<00:03:28.989> where<00:03:29.079> got<00:03:29.230> your<00:03:29.350> spark

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
that's obviously where got your spark

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.440 
that's obviously where got your spark
plug<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.010> then<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.700> other<00:03:30.820> problem<00:03:31.000> we<00:03:31.239> have

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
plug and then the other problem we have

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.600 
plug and then the other problem we have
is<00:03:31.780> getting<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.230> one<00:03:32.380> out<00:03:32.560> now<00:03:33.280> I've<00:03:33.459> been

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
is getting that one out now I've been

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.420 
is getting that one out now I've been
recommended<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:35.790> take<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.060> tank<00:03:37.690> off<00:03:38.430> fairly

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
recommended to take the tank off fairly

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.699 
recommended to take the tank off fairly
