00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
erector spinae muscles here which is

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.680 
erector spinae muscles here which is
just<00:00:41.989> either<00:00:42.260> side<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:42.920> spine<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.690> they

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
just either side of the spine and they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.170 
just either side of the spine and they
run<00:00:44.899> all<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.200> way<00:00:45.260> up<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.590> back<00:00:45.739> actually<00:00:46.180> but

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
run all the way up the back actually but

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.819 
run all the way up the back actually but
you're<00:00:47.780> probably<00:00:47.960> going<00:00:48.200> to<00:00:48.320> be<00:00:48.500> mostly

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
you're probably going to be mostly

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.490 
you're probably going to be mostly
interested<00:00:49.220> in<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.790> lower<00:00:50.270> spine<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
interested in the lower spine and the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.870 
interested in the lower spine and the
mid-back<00:00:51.860> because<00:00:52.280> that's<00:00:52.430> where<00:00:52.610> most<00:00:52.730> of

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
mid-back because that's where most of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.190 
mid-back because that's where most of
these<00:00:52.970> twinges<00:00:53.480> tend<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.500> happen<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:56.200> you'll

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
these twinges tend to happen and you'll

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.150 
these twinges tend to happen and you'll
pick<00:00:57.380> a<00:00:57.410> side<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.610> okay<00:00:59.059> if<00:00:59.500> if<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.680> continue

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
pick a side it's okay if if you continue

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.400 
pick a side it's okay if if you continue
to<00:01:01.190> wear<00:01:01.430> your<00:01:01.730> t<00:01:01.910> shirt<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.870> fact<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.350> think

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
to wear your t shirt in fact I think

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.319 
to wear your t shirt in fact I think
it's<00:01:03.590> better<00:01:03.800> if<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:04.399> continue<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:04.939> wear<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
it's better if you continue to wear the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.569 
it's better if you continue to wear the
t-shirt<00:01:05.780> because<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.920> way<00:01:07.069> you<00:01:07.100> don't<00:01:07.399> have

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
t-shirt because that way you don't have

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.800 
t-shirt because that way you don't have
the<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.329> rubber<00:01:08.929> of<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.319> ball<00:01:09.530> kind<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.009> like

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
the the rubber of the ball kind of like

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.289 
the the rubber of the ball kind of like
disrupting<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.929> skin<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:13.219> and<00:01:13.549> then<00:01:13.850> you

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
disrupting the skin so and then you

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.940 
disrupting the skin so and then you
place<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.719> ball<00:01:14.899> there<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.649> erector

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
place the ball there on the erector

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.819 
place the ball there on the erector
spinae<00:01:16.189> muscles<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.030> put<00:01:17.929> one<00:01:18.139> hand<00:01:18.350> there

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
spinae muscles and put one hand there

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.469 
spinae muscles and put one hand there
get<00:01:19.429> your<00:01:19.549> friend<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.759> pop<00:01:19.939> one<00:01:19.969> hand<00:01:20.329> there

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
get your friend to pop one hand there

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.629 
get your friend to pop one hand there

and then you can apply a little bit of

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.639 
and then you can apply a little bit of
extra<00:01:22.759> pressure<00:01:23.179> with<00:01:23.359> the<00:01:23.420> other<00:01:23.569> hand<00:01:23.869> what
