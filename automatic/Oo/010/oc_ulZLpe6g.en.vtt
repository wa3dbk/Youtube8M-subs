00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello tonight when is Masuda-bound this time 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.280
 Well then this introductory Well you again jewelry racket of Rakettochimi which is now in here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.260
 It is the first introduction after becoming this account 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.310
 And another one is the bloodline of this Shake 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.190
 Well something I will introduce in the I wish I put a little 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.130
 Well this is better than my professional pet dad bar than a racket goes into the case 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.540
 I have grip tape now 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.660
 Thick back with frontal mountain 3-64- 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.989
 Although some people who know well is Atsu 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.290
 Although Well this was introduced very nice and even minor feeling, etc 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.680
 I would like to say once again what 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.410
 Well's a little I heavier boring in that the racket itself takes 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.820
 In Epe of Well Well Well about a little heavy 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.590
 I'd kinda think in the fact that if there grip tape 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 Only 200 in the g column 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.670
 I think there are some 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.770
 Since the Well, even the place to say that the plate is big here at that area of the rubber is wide 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 Even if it is open, the area representative of rubber 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:13.540
 It is it you do so the Tteyuu it's more of the flick and say you either snap say 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 Say you I reasonable with all if the horizontal on a rotating Toka on a rotating system snap 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.040
 A strong continuous beating or rather inquiries after drive 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.030
 It is especially good that Bucker is particularly good with this great castle and violin 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.110
 Ne 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.340
 Yes 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.970
 A book that probably has a pretty good time with violin 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.620
 I have never had a chance to use Nittak, though 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.400
 I used it for the first time with a decent mountain and I used it for about a month 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.730
 I will 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:45.320
 Although it is a very hard rubber 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:49.520
 It is a special type of rubber with a hard block that can be driven like a soft rubber . 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.050
 I in front of the house is also quite or rather why a place to stop easy to block 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.900
 You can poor if the process control to bar iii ends up 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.660
 Well goodness is such a place 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:07.440
 Oh , I have lost my history of playing with this racket in the first round of the prefecture tournament 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.300
 I thought it was quite strong even though it was included, and still the wall of the rights tournament was big 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 Left end fragments 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.739
 I think it was table software 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.069
 Is how to do I thought I'd think that he was Both are difficult to do Well the fact that the left 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.670
 Table specific 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.670
 Do you have been 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 Even if it was done 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.299
 Hey I have that happens to have habit would go knuckle block gradually 6 down 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.150
 I 'd like to bring it to you 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:43.180
 In a pattern that would ended up saying Pashin in you do not want to do Nante table Nanki-based But 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.450
 My got it yes 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.090
 What Shia in the third place of the previous tournament 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.990
 Even though there was a type 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:01.320
 It's frustrating, but the subsequent rookie competition rally competition during the district competition 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.690
 Age or Well good you and thymine Gama result in this racket good feeling once in Taka fourth place 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.900
 Kedomo I think Naa Toka will be perfect 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.990
 But I'm using about 1 month 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.170
 As for the barber Rasant who says that the middle has become vacant 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.360
 I have a feeling of rushing because I can see the tower 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.500
 Man said a little shell 1 network do such Te while even this is still okay at the time of the Temple 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.880
 You 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 Even if something is a bit disappointing, the place where the dream is open has become a bit harder to wait. 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.390
 is 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.500
 Well rackets are especially recommended at the Bio-Institut 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:40.870
 I will introduce Japanese snow and the Japanese snow 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 Well it is a racket upright light check price Did you introduce the 4- sided rubber before also 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.170
 Bow Graphics and tc 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.420
 I'm going to look like a boost tissue 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.650
 The bag is spear 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.950
 Super spin pips tpu super sp pips chop sponge 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.830
 It is and cut man 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.740
 The market itself is a bit of a blade for beginners as long as it is a matyu and a pressure. 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.660
 Even this one 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.480
 Well , I was cutting it so light I cut it and it 's a fly away 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.640
 I think it's too much 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.230
 Day much just right at Bakker But 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.049
 I do not really know the difference in how to cut knuckle cut petit 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.280
 Well Dara This 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:26.480
 Well, I wonder if I can connect lightly even 34 times for me from my hometown 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:31.180
 If it is an intense drive, it's a child but it's a drive that will emerge a little 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.180
 You can lightly iodine village you were drive of the loop Pounds 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.380
 The rest is Pasin 2 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:43.600
 Why I'd do if it can not it think Do You can back 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:47.129
 Well this foreside is a timer attack type so it flies like no cut at all 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.940
 It is too much, but if it cuts once and enters, it goes out to the mouth already 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.810
 Off I Ja do good Kuikome to soft butyrate 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.820
