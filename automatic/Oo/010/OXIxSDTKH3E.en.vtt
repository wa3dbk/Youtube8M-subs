00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
tell me the estimated finish time which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.749 
tell me the estimated finish time which
is<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.660> 341<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> approximately<00:01:50.190> an<00:01:50.640> hour

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
is at 341 which is approximately an hour

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.540 
is at 341 which is approximately an hour
from<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.119> an<00:01:51.420> hour<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> 15<00:01:52.110> minutes<00:01:52.460> at<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
from now an hour and 15 minutes at the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.640 
from now an hour and 15 minutes at the
bottom<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.690> see<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
bottom down here we can see that it

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.620 
bottom down here we can see that it
shows<00:01:55.890> what<00:01:56.340> status<00:01:56.790> were<00:01:56.910> at<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.330> right<00:01:57.479> now

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
shows what status were at so right now

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
shows what status were at so right now
we<00:01:57.690> are<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> high<00:01:58.320> speed<00:01:58.740> charging<00:01:59.400> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
we are at the high speed charging we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.130 
we are at the high speed charging we
just<00:01:59.910> passed<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.660> now<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.900> moving

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
just passed that up and now we're moving

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.560 
just passed that up and now we're moving
into<00:02:01.259> continuation<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.090> charges

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
into continuation this basically charges

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
into continuation this basically charges
slower<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.770> allows<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.160> battery<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
slower and it allows you a battery to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
slower and it allows you a battery to
charge<00:02:05.729> almost<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.720> 100%<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
charge almost to 100% so that way it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
charge almost to 100% so that way it
will<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.489> completely<00:02:08.850> full<00:02:09.030> instead<00:02:09.390> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
will be completely full instead of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.750 
will be completely full instead of
overcharging<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.800> last<00:02:11.009> section<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> trickle

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
overcharging the last section is trickle

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
overcharging the last section is trickle
charging<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.720> yet<00:02:12.959> which

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
charging which we are not at yet which

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320 
charging which we are not at yet which
means<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.100> charge<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
means it will charge up to up to the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
means it will charge up to up to the
full<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> drains<00:02:16.260> back<00:02:16.530> down<00:02:16.709> it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
full and then as it drains back down it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.229 
full and then as it drains back down it
will<00:02:16.920> keep<00:02:17.070> recharging<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.120> stays

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
will keep recharging it so it stays

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.430 
will keep recharging it so it stays
right<00:02:18.600> at<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> full<00:02:19.080> level<00:02:19.320> without

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
right at the full level without

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.449 
right at the full level without
overcharging<00:02:21.800> another<00:02:22.800> cool<00:02:23.010> feature<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.370> I

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
overcharging another cool feature as I

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.940 
overcharging another cool feature as I
can<00:02:23.640> see<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.420> record<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.170> battery<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
can see the record of my battery so you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.470 
can see the record of my battery so you
can<00:02:26.100> see<00:02:26.280> how<00:02:26.519> many<00:02:26.580> times<00:02:26.700> I've<00:02:27.000> had<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> full

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
can see how many times I've had a full

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.140 
can see how many times I've had a full
cycle<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.500> well<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:28.920> how<00:02:29.040> many<00:02:29.220> times<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.730> have

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
partially charged or overcharged so as

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.670 
partially charged or overcharged so as
you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.330> see<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.690> blue<00:02:33.900> shows<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.410> I've<00:02:34.530> had

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
you can see the blue shows that I've had

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
you can see the blue shows that I've had
a<00:02:34.709> full<00:02:34.920> cycle<00:02:35.280> twice<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.180> I've

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
a full cycle twice and that I've

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.720 
a full cycle twice and that I've
partially<00:02:36.750> charged<00:02:37.049> once<00:02:37.380> or<00:02:37.860> three<00:02:38.519> times

I'm sorry and you can see that I have

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.199 
I'm sorry and you can see that I have
never<00:02:40.709> overcharged<00:02:41.489> which<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> very<00:02:42.030> good

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
never overcharged which is a very good

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.100 
never overcharged which is a very good
thing<00:02:42.450> because<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.989> bad<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.650> battery

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
thing because that is bad for my battery

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.380 
thing because that is bad for my battery
over<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.860> system<00:02:47.459> where<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.910> shows<00:02:48.150> I

over here is my system where it shows I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.850 
over here is my system where it shows I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
degrees Celsius now this is important

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.830 
degrees Celsius now this is important
because<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:56.850> battery<00:02:57.060> gets<00:02:57.269> too<00:02:57.450> hot<00:02:57.660> it

could be bad for it now I can also see

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.490 
could be bad for it now I can also see
how<00:03:00.000> much<00:03:00.090> used<00:03:00.390> or<00:03:00.540> am<00:03:00.630> i<00:03:00.780> half<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.320> much

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
how much used or am i half and how much

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.430 
how much used or am i half and how much
you<00:03:01.590> use<00:03:01.620> CPU<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:03.000> basically<00:03:03.450> shows<00:03:03.540> how

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you use CPU and this basically shows how

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.960 
you use CPU and this basically shows how
much<00:03:04.590> processing<00:03:05.250> power<00:03:05.340> was<00:03:05.610> being<00:03:05.790> used

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
much processing power was being used

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.900 
much processing power was being used
which<00:03:06.239> does<00:03:06.480> use<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.810> battery

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
which does use up battery

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.330 
which does use up battery
this<00:03:08.660> also<00:03:08.840> shows<00:03:09.230> my<00:03:09.470> storage<00:03:09.770> status<00:03:10.220> which

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
this also shows my storage status which

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.250 
this also shows my storage status which
does<00:03:10.460> not<00:03:10.550> necessarily<00:03:11.030> affect<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.810> battery

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
does not necessarily affect the battery

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.660 
does not necessarily affect the battery
usage<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:12.770> it<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:12.980> still<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> very<00:03:13.460> useful

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
usage but it is still a very useful

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.240 
usage but it is still a very useful
statistic<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.540> want<00:03:14.780> quite<00:03:15.200> frequently<00:03:15.620> and

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
statistic you want quite frequently and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.310 
statistic you want quite frequently and
of<00:03:16.760> course<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.090> can<00:03:17.240> see<00:03:17.390> serial<00:03:17.810> numbers<00:03:18.080> on<00:03:18.200> my

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
of course I can see serial numbers on my

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.700 
of course I can see serial numbers on my
battery<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:19.190> well<00:03:19.490> as<00:03:19.700> if<00:03:20.030> I'm<00:03:20.150> jailbroken

now as I swipe down you can see there's

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.640 
now as I swipe down you can see there's
a<00:03:37.430> nice<00:03:37.610> battery<00:03:38.060> status<00:03:38.360> thing<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:39.350> here<00:03:39.590> at

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
a nice battery status thing up here at

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.440 
a nice battery status thing up here at
the<00:03:39.740> very<00:03:39.890> top<00:03:40.100> now<00:03:40.820> basically<00:03:41.000> what<00:03:41.240> this<00:03:41.390> is

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the very top now basically what this is

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.450 
the very top now basically what this is
is<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.870> some<00:03:42.050> quick<00:03:42.260> toggles<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.770> changing

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
is it some quick toggles to changing

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.760 
is it some quick toggles to changing
your<00:03:44.210> battery<00:03:44.600> settings<00:03:44.960> so<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.290> can<00:03:45.530> switch

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
your battery settings so I can switch

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.320 
your battery settings so I can switch
from<00:03:45.800> right<00:03:46.100> here<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.340> can<00:03:46.640> switch<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.180> my

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
from right here I can switch to my

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.910 
from right here I can switch to my
outdoor<00:03:47.690> setting<00:03:48.080> directly<00:03:48.830> from

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
outdoor setting directly from

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.770 
outdoor setting directly from
Notification<00:03:49.550> Center<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.270> then<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.630> can

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
switch back into indoor I can also see

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.340 
switch back into indoor I can also see
the<00:03:55.820> open<00:03:56.090> app<00:03:56.240> so<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.870> also<00:03:56.990> a<00:03:57.110> good<00:03:57.200> way

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
the open app so this is also a good way

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.020 
the open app so this is also a good way
to<00:03:57.410> add<00:03:57.650> an<00:03:57.860> app<00:03:57.980> switcher<00:03:58.430> into<00:03:58.820> your

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
to add an app switcher into your

to add an app switcher into your
Notification<00:03:59.630> Center<00:03:59.660> I<00:04:00.110> can<00:04:00.260> scroll<00:04:00.650> through

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
Notification Center I can scroll through

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.800 
Notification Center I can scroll through
and<00:04:00.920> see<00:04:01.070> what's<00:04:01.250> open<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.760> then<00:04:02.210> I<00:04:02.240> can<00:04:02.540> quit

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
and see what's open and then I can quit

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.370 
and see what's open and then I can quit
apps<00:04:03.020> as<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:04.070> necessary<00:04:04.990> up<00:04:05.990> here<00:04:06.200> in<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
apps as I see necessary up here in the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.740 
apps as I see necessary up here in the
top<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.680> see<00:04:06.710> used<00:04:07.040> RAM<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.700> tap<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.360> can

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
top we see used RAM if I tap that I can

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.390 
top we see used RAM if I tap that I can
close<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.320> apps<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.650> are<00:04:09.740> using<00:04:10.010> up<00:04:10.160> too

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
close the apps that are using up too

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640 
close the apps that are using up too
much<00:04:10.580> RAM<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.780> leaves<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.290> clears<00:04:12.560> up

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
much RAM so that leaves that clears up

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.930 
much RAM so that leaves that clears up
some<00:04:12.709> ramen<00:04:13.190> as<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.490> see<00:04:13.640> now<00:04:13.760> I'm<00:04:13.820> down

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
some ramen as you can see now I'm down

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.479 
some ramen as you can see now I'm down
to<00:04:14.000> two<00:04:14.380> 62%<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:15.560> there<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:15.800> no<00:04:15.950> apps<00:04:16.160> running

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
to two 62% and there is no apps running

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.310 
to two 62% and there is no apps running
which<00:04:16.790> is<00:04:16.820> saving<00:04:17.390> me<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.690> lot<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.020> RAM

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
which is saving me a lot of RAM

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.310 
which is saving me a lot of RAM
I<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.560> also<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.950> course<00:04:18.980> see<00:04:19.489> all<00:04:19.670> my<00:04:19.820> out<00:04:20.030> so
