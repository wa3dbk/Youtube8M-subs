00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.289
 in that position 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.289
 of them 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.570
 in termas apartment 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.970
 the efforts of wolfenstein quique 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.700
 presents 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.190
 what would happen if you combine two effects 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.770
 exhibitions opposite to and welcome 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.820
 a new video of wolf thinking that s 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.530
 only recently did good videos as 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.710
 they read in the comment and as they saw 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.940
 in the image today we will see or we will know what 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.950
 would happen if you put regeneration and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.570
 poison at the same time good here is 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:09.909
 the effect of regeneration the effect of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.689
 poison and I'll explain how it works 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.469
 well this works as you will see here 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.969
 first this is the command we put the 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:25.689
 command effect after we can your name 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:29.920
 then we put the effect number 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.609
 on this occasion the number 16 of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.219
 regeneration we put the time that 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.299
 we want it to last in seconds 20 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:44.010
 seconds and the power with which 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:49.650
 we want you to have this time is 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.500
 40 I think it's the most powerful and not 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.909
 I can change it because I'm a survival 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.780
 but good let's start 3 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.119
 one 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 in the description I will leave you all about 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.930
 the effects 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.900
 to which scratches leave no stains to see 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.829
 how do I do it like that, yes, no, no, 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.880
 well I do not know if he will be watching but my 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.400
 hearts are green 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.590
 of the position of the poison and they are 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 regenerating clear regeneration 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.040
 and I'm like a cycle thank you 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.280
 repeaters to see I'll remove this which is the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.180
 of regeneration but it's just giving me 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.349
 poison 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.349
 here is the poison 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.870
 is giving me poison and there they were in 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:56.040
 poison prison regeneration 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 you and like wow 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 is 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.450
 I do not have no and fine because it has not come out 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.610
 for 1.6 not 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.890
 well that's been everything is what would happen 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.750
 if I put two commands at the same time 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.750
 of opposites 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.040
 I hope you see me in the next video 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.040
 more in sight 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.670
