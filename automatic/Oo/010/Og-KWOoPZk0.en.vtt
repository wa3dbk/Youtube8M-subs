discussion so when you're looking at

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.900 
discussion so when you're looking at
both<00:00:17.119> cards<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.080> Camden<00:00:18.619> has<00:00:18.740> 94<00:00:19.250> speed<00:00:19.640> that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
both cards the Camden has 94 speed that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.960 
both cards the Camden has 94 speed that
Colin<00:00:20.150> capitalized<00:00:20.720> 6-speed<00:00:21.550> well<00:00:22.550> as<00:00:22.640> far<00:00:22.849> as

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
Colin capitalized 6-speed well as far as

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.700 
Colin capitalized 6-speed well as far as
throw<00:00:23.210> power<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.630> Colin<00:00:23.960> Kaepernick<00:00:24.499> has<00:00:24.679> a

Kaepernick and then the medium is almost
the<00:00:35.300> same<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.660> throw<00:00:35.840> accuracy<00:00:36.470> deep<00:00:36.680> we'll

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the same to throw accuracy deep we'll

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.060 
the same to throw accuracy deep we'll
see<00:00:37.160> some<00:00:37.190> switches<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.930> if<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.140> see<00:00:39.380> here<00:00:39.890> as

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
see some switches so if you see here as

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.880 
see some switches so if you see here as
I<00:00:40.520> went<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.180> after<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:41.840> last<00:00:42.200> game<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:42.620> you

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
I went on after that last game that you

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.920 
I went on after that last game that you
saw<00:00:43.160> gameplay<00:00:43.490> between<00:00:44.060> Colin<00:00:44.390> Kaepernick

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
saw gameplay between Colin Kaepernick

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.510 
saw gameplay between Colin Kaepernick
Colin<00:00:45.260> Kaepernick<00:00:45.680> was<00:00:45.830> doing<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.160> lot<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.340> the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
Colin Kaepernick was doing a lot of the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.700 
Colin Kaepernick was doing a lot of the
same<00:00:46.730> things<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:47.420> fitting<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.290> ball<00:00:48.500> into

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
same things and fitting the ball into

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.650 
same things and fitting the ball into
tight<00:00:49.070> windows<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.060> what<00:00:50.300> are<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.480> major

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
tight windows so what are the major

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.140 
tight windows so what are the major

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
differences you say well it has to do in

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.120 
differences you say well it has to do in
the<00:00:53.240> actual<00:00:53.630> running<00:00:53.900> of<00:00:54.110> it<00:00:54.290> if<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:54.890> saw

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
the actual running of it if you saw

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.760 
the actual running of it if you saw
before<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.270> actual<00:00:56.720> truck<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.380> Juke<00:00:57.740> move

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
before the actual truck and Juke move

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.710 
before the actual truck and Juke move
and<00:00:58.220> all<00:00:58.310> those<00:00:58.430> other<00:00:58.730> options<00:00:59.330> as<00:00:59.390> far<00:00:59.450> as

of wet and the one thing I'll tell you
is<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.759> my<00:01:11.270> running<00:01:11.780> game<00:01:12.079> was<00:01:12.409> pretty

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
is that my running game was pretty

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.719 
is that my running game was pretty
vicious<00:01:13.719> from<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:15.049> start<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:16.100> allowed<00:01:16.460> me<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
vicious from the start it allowed me to

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.730 
vicious from the start it allowed me to
do<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.939> couple<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.450> these<00:01:17.570> other<00:01:17.810> misdirection

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
do a couple of these other misdirection

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.580 
do a couple of these other misdirection
type<00:01:19.009> plays<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.729> Cam<00:01:20.479> Newton's<00:01:20.899> accuracy

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
type plays and Cam Newton's accuracy

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.020 
type plays and Cam Newton's accuracy
believe<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.009> or<00:01:22.100> not<00:01:22.249> was<00:01:22.520> pretty<00:01:22.850> good

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
believe it or not was pretty good

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.059 
believe it or not was pretty good
whenever<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.509> came<00:01:23.719> with<00:01:23.929> those<00:01:24.079> here<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:24.920> can

again<00:03:23.330> my<00:03:23.840> first<00:03:24.260> opinion<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.580> really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
again my first opinion is if you really

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.190 
again my first opinion is if you really
like<00:03:25.970> reading<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.360> read<00:03:26.510> option<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.170> you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
like reading the read option and you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.960 
like reading the read option and you
want<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.709> mobile<00:03:28.040> quarterback<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.670> think<00:03:28.850> your

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
want a mobile quarterback I think your

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.360 
want a mobile quarterback I think your
number<00:03:29.239> one<00:03:29.390> option<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.110> 24-hour<00:03:30.890> moves

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
number one option is that 24-hour moves
