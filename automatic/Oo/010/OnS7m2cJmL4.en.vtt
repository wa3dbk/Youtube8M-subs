00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
annoy somebody else and I was really

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.900 
annoy somebody else and I was really
nervous<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.650> people<00:00:29.279> wouldn't<00:00:29.430> like<00:00:29.669> it<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
nervous that people wouldn't like it and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.790 
nervous that people wouldn't like it and
and<00:00:32.240> then<00:00:32.390> we<00:00:32.450> start<00:00:32.660> playing<00:00:32.750> live<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:33.440> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
and then we start playing live and the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.900 
and then we start playing live and the
record<00:00:34.040> came<00:00:34.190> out<00:00:34.280> people<00:00:34.460> seem<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.790> really

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
record came out people seem to really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.979 
record came out people seem to really
like<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.420> then<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.570> got<00:00:35.750> really<00:00:35.780> excited

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
like it and then I got really excited

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.530 
like it and then I got really excited
about<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:37.489> prospect<00:00:37.970> of<00:00:38.090> songwriting

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
about the prospect of songwriting

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.330 
about the prospect of songwriting
because<00:00:38.900> even<00:00:39.140> if<00:00:39.230> Aaron<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:39.500> don't<00:00:39.710> typically

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
because even if Aaron I don't typically

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.220 
because even if Aaron I don't typically
write<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.880> lot<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.180> songs<00:00:41.330> together<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:42.110> was

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
write a lot of songs together so it was

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.290 
write a lot of songs together so it was
like<00:00:42.410> maybe<00:00:43.400> we<00:00:43.610> could<00:00:43.790> try<00:00:43.970> doing<00:00:44.180> that

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
like maybe we could try doing that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.680 
like maybe we could try doing that
together<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.790> so<00:00:46.790> we<00:00:46.910> went<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.180> New<00:00:47.300> Orleans

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
together and so we went to New Orleans

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.750 
together and so we went to New Orleans
and<00:00:48.500> we<00:00:48.590> wrote<00:00:48.739> some<00:00:48.920> songs<00:00:49.100> together<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.699> it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
and we wrote some songs together and it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.490 
and we wrote some songs together and it
was<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.690> was<00:00:50.809> like<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.989> white<00:00:51.140> stripes

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
was like it was like the white stripes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.340 
was like it was like the white stripes
but<00:00:51.800> with<00:00:52.010> two<00:00:52.160> girls<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.730> was<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.480> thought

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
but with two girls it was like I thought

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.960 
but with two girls it was like I thought
on<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.620> drawings<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.160> sara<00:00:55.370> had<00:00:55.580> an<00:00:55.670> electric

on the drawings and sara had an electric

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.340 
on the drawings and sara had an electric
guitar<00:00:56.059> we<00:00:56.390> just<00:00:56.570> put<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.720> microphone<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
guitar we just put a microphone in the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.590 
guitar we just put a microphone in the
middle<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.710> room<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.300> microphone

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
we probably a little bit I listened to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.460 
we probably a little bit I listened to
the<00:01:08.540> other<00:01:08.690> day<00:01:08.810> they're<00:01:08.990> okay<00:01:09.259> they're

the other day they're okay they're

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.680 
the other day they're okay they're
really<00:01:10.220> weird<00:01:10.460> cuz<00:01:10.670> we<00:01:10.789> sing<00:01:11.060> back<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.479> forth

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
really weird cuz we sing back and forth

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.850 
really weird cuz we sing back and forth
which<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.110> going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.289> try<00:01:12.380> doing<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.710> little
