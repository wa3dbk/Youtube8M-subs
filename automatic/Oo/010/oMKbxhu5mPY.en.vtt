 In those days I do not live in the dry square. 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.610
 There was a lot of the rooster renato leandro né 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.689

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.490
 A little earlier, I trained for the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.039

 great coach talked a lot to the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.790
 also because in our 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:53.320
 group was complicated to 6 from the penalty for 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.470
 djalma I made marcelinho marquinhos

 maybe one or the other is not like this 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.230
 practically everybody burst in football 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.420

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.920
 practically all had the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.050
 A little more career we will take the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.170
 football will not be as soon as Carlos 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.730
 better and ii and died there not 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.350
 have had any career has other 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.780
 clubs that not only to me I remember 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.659
 I talked a lot with ernesto paulo 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 in this country was in my time of 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.659
 Juniors also the Botafogo Fluminense and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.370
 Rio and we hit it too chat 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.650
 always speak very well of the generation of 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.170
 Flemish he spoke that the generation that 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.250
 had everything to replace our 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.150
 to arrive 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.510
 logical that some still had a 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.560
 stay 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 so for example people like zinho 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.870
 I love you, Ailton. 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.930
 Carlos 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.590
 the unit will no longer be needed then 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.130
 powder 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.440
 in Camboriu in this is beautiful nesting 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.470
 Guys, everyone's coming. It's going to fit. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 beautiful and I think the Flemish gave him 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.100
 I did not even think I did. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.190
 around small problems that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.410
 between one player and another and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.130
 and then suddenly how is it that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.570
 world appeared more out of the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.140
 best for the Flemish 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.310
 the staff was champion in 92 of champion 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.920
 Brazilian 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.920
 and then began to fall apart
