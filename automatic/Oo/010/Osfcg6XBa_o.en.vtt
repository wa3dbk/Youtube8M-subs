00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 but counted 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.130
 if unfortunately nothing was a good day 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.510
 for us everything went wrong started 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.690
 when very well and selected very 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.120
 early bad luck according to what they tell me 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.320
 now that the habit was wrong not 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.610
 is against him in the first goal of rubber 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.530
 and then I think the team insisted 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.210
 well and they are a your channel a good first 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.550
 time has more time the ball more 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.190
 more arrival we missed the fate of 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.620
 specify again the second time 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.239
 risking with equal chaco entry 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.330
 we are on top of them until the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.650
 expulsion of mayorga and if it was much more 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.790
 complicated not to attack with 10 it was more 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.040
 difficult to recover the ball from 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.770
 midfield of the team insisted to 8 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.590
 we had some goal options a little 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.440
 run over but there is more or less than not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.530
 we could specify until the final phase yes 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.750
 it was one of those days when I did not 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.989
 it comes out not the truth the bug team 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.390
 was delivered with 10 all followed 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.180
 running and getting in search of the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 tie although unfortunately did not fall 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 an arbitral failure 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.420
 there are seven parties that are counted 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.100
 with bad luck, our 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.050
 accountant and obviously changes all the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.530
 party because we were better 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.990
 standing on the court with 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 with more possession and circulation we had 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.229
 to arrive and always achieve to row against 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 the current but but go tell yourself 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.770
 17 matches do not count yet today yes 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:48.240
 we had bad luck and everything 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.580
 they found the results if they really 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 it is very difficult obviously we will be 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.049
 pending but we know that it is very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 difficult today we need to win the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.020
 problems a tie to have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 some hope and unfortunately not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.390
 saw really two are very scarce 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 possibilities 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.119
 viewing the work of the team 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.119
 gardens 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.060
 how are the results but if we have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.569
 to start thinking about that in the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 Preparation is missing more than a month 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.220
 unfortunately, we will have a lot 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.440
 time that when we will have to look 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.170
 rivals and things like that to try to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.049
 maintain or improve our pace 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.819
 distributed until 13 December or be 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:40.879
 that we have more than a month yet to 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.159
 this game is a hard blow all this is 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:47.599
 a failure I have to look for grace that 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:50.060
 it's a failure more from me than the no 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.389
 qualify clear that what is understood as 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 one more failure now that we know that 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.540
 we had to keep pace and 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.810
 and continue playing for the World Cup 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.810
 clubs 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.409
 yes because it has been a hard blow no no 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.900
 qualify we have to raise it 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.069
 psychically person and that with mature is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.260
 we really have a lot more experience 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.090
 with character that did something the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.150
 importance of the tournament that we are going to play 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.299
 in December that is also there 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.120
 a motivation for such a tournament 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.599
 important but yes clear today has been a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.739
 channel point virtually eliminated 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.739
 louis good night 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:49.180
 planning from the beginning though 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:49.180
 always said that performance 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.959
 but there are many factors to analyze what 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.049
 we can talk about but one thing not and 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.000
 also limits are 17 games 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.310
 no you can not talk about a party anything 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 wrong 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.120
 profe 2 asks comics with the first 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.120
 I create a distinctive 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.640
 It would be unfortunate to regret the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.040
 death of hugo sÃ¡nchez portugal 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.970
 in a tragedy that surprised us 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:26.210
 everyone and really let him die of that 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.539
 way a young habitat 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.160
 and the truth is that he was a very good guy and 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.430
 true that it did give us a lot and we 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.560
 was very surprised and the second sentence today 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.630
 in minutes before starting the match 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.389
 it would be a fight between fans of 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.479
 Saturn and anti-riot are talking about the 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.569
 fractured several detainees with 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.610
 policemen also hurt in 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.440
 interviews in several said that it is the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.569
 same situation in the country that does not trust 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.000
 in the police and on the other hand also 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.509
 amateurs who already felt like water 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.729
 to the neck or this frustration suddenly 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.160
 the equipment we put to mine instructions 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.250
 what is the message to the nation not by 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.479
 violence will always be regrettable 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.669
 have made many efforts to 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.389
 eradicate it unfortunately has not been 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.789
 could achieve at all times produce 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.070
 unfortunate does not lead us to anything of 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.780
 fernando today he is overestimating the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.780
 Mexican arbitration of what I ask because 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.270
 he left says he gathers they ask for conditions for 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.340
 the guild yesterday in the party of saints 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.539
 against pachuca there were many mistakes and today 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.539
 of charge practically 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.660
 I do not insist on the same habits 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.850
 wrong anywhere in the world 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.160
 sometimes in favor sometimes against today 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.960
 we had bad luck in such a match 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:50.620
 important and starting the game but it 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:56.950
 they will continue to be wrong here in all 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.240
 sides that meet with improving the 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.820
 arbitration is not going to be a day to 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.440
 another one needs a lot of work time 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.800
 teacher 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.290
 we have a very good staff and with 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.960
 that same campus practically as 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.710
 leader the no previous sector and if we win 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.710
 the concacaf tournament 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.330
 they were weighed by the use of the device 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.380
 no not sincerely not at the most 6 of a 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.760
 extraordinary tournament 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.320
 we are or we were the best defense less 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.720
 beaten 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.240
 not the truth I think that in that aspect 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.530
 I do not weigh it 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.530
 the song is a lot
