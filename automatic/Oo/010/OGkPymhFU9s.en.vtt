final look of Alexander Wang you know

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.420

because<00:06:36.010> he's<00:06:36.190> now<00:06:36.430> preparing<00:06:37.330> for<00:06:37.660> Valencia

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
because he's now preparing for Valencia

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.090 
because he's now preparing for Valencia
he<00:06:39.430> still<00:06:39.730> kept<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.360> his<00:06:40.600> own<00:06:40.870> signature<00:06:41.800> so

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
he still kept to his own signature so

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.820 
he still kept to his own signature so
strongly<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:43.090> I<00:06:43.750> think<00:06:44.020> that's<00:06:44.260> the<00:06:44.440> sign<00:06:44.800> of

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
strongly and I think that's the sign of
