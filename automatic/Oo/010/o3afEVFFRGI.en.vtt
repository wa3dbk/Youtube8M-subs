00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.559
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.559
 You have come back to us, but this time nothing else has ended up 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.289
 for that matter 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.140
 I became 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
 that I can't program interesting program 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.880
 to keep it all dry for too long 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.109
 also the first candidates for his car came all over the world 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 the first candidate for the day 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.140
 this one 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 what's his name again? 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 an idea 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.140
 oh hommen 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.240
 kh 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.280
 the Hague 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.180
 that is very important in autumn in berlin 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.750
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.420
 7 you can come to us 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 gerard hageman 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.710
 on a few hundred cards away in 6 out 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.340
 Stockholm can then see how the flag hangs 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.480
 to test extra a year ago 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.890
 we need a little bit better with that banana 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 as opponents must naturally keep 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 the pair is not childish 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.380
 but work 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.440
 we know 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.740
 so that the water 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.909
 for the deficits will soon 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.970
 conclusion that it is therefore with 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.790
 then we will still not be there 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.880
 I find that the clarities out 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.270
 the former TV 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.360
 It is true that she retired no one was injured 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330
 hendrickx 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.780
 nice on the survey 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.360
 just tops 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 for the win 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.510
 nice it's a squatter 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 brama can be at number three 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.089
 thereby drove 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.419
 we work 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.819
 the rider 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.869
 tomtom but we want to avoid 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.869
 what a number 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.929
 I think you have some time 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.809
 he may already try something 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.099
 the church 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.739
 when then we always have for you i also know the commission 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 so i think i think i don't mind 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.869
 after a long solo 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.369
 and that is to see the earth 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.439
 maybe it sounds 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.189
 i like to be true a new one 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.729
 he is also the man behind 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.779
 at not too thick on this ek 12 year old 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.630
 that can be a matter of being convinced that then know by e-mail 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.850
 the bernard wientjes working group still thinks if you stephen a year earlier 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.169
 harper a penalty kick 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:14.159

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:32.879

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.229
