I<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.890> assume<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:12.210> different<00:01:12.420> points

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I would assume and your different points

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
I would assume and your different points
for<00:01:12.780> each<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
for each one is that you have to have a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
for each one is that you have to have a
sudden<00:01:14.520> combat<00:01:15.119> level<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.689> entity<00:01:15.930> each<00:01:16.110> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
sudden combat level to entity each one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
sudden combat level to entity each one
and<00:01:16.650> eventually<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> won't<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.670> enough

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and eventually you won't you get enough

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.330 
it just took me quite a while to do
there<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.649> equip<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there we go I can equip it now and I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
there we go I can equip it now and I
look<00:01:50.490> absolutely<00:01:50.759> ridiculous<00:01:51.270> anyway<00:01:51.930> let's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
look absolutely ridiculous anyway let's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
look absolutely ridiculous anyway let's
go<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> let's<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> exchange<00:01:53.970> points

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
go to the let's go to exchange points

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
go to the let's go to exchange points
against<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.659> go<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> 0<00:01:55.049> call<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.710> looks<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.009> bad

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
against and go to 0 call it looks so bad

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.359 
against and go to 0 call it looks so bad
now<00:01:56.399> setting<00:01:56.880> zero<00:01:57.360> points<00:01:57.920> void<00:01:58.920> equipment

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
now setting zero points void equipment

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.569 
now setting zero points void equipment
is<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.360> good<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.200> mainly<00:02:01.979> used<00:02:02.369> for

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
is very very good and is mainly used for

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.490 
is very very good and is mainly used for
the<00:02:02.880> range<00:02:03.119> equipments<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.930> many<00:02:04.049> people<00:02:04.290> use

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the range equipments not many people use

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.690 
the range equipments not many people use
the<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.079> mage<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.740> melee<00:02:08.160> equipment

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the the the mage or the melee equipment

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.550 
the the the mage or the melee equipment
is<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.030> mainly<00:02:09.479> useful<00:02:09.660> Ranger<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.379> that's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
is it mainly useful Ranger and that's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
is it mainly useful Ranger and that's
why<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.069> where<00:02:11.220> you'll<00:02:11.400> probably<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
why that's where you'll probably see it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.130 
why that's where you'll probably see it
the<00:02:12.330> most

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the most

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.830 
the most
anyway<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.310> here's<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> first<00:02:15.420> boats

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

level<00:02:21.720> boat<00:02:21.930> which<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.200> could<00:02:22.350> actually<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.770> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
level boat which I could actually do so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.080 
level boat which I could actually do so
I<00:02:22.980> might<00:02:23.100> actually<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.610> join<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.940> now

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
I might actually go and join that now

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.940 
I might actually go and join that now
and<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:24.360> before<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> Mon<00:02:24.960> I'm<00:02:25.200> still<00:02:25.710> using

for a set amount of time and of course
portals<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.620> spawn<00:03:22.920> lots<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.489> enemies<00:03:24.330> as

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
portals they spawn lots of enemies as

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.740 
portals they spawn lots of enemies as
you<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.170> see<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:27.299> actually<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> first

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can see so this actually the first

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
you can see so this actually the first
time<00:03:27.959> I've<00:03:28.080> been<00:03:28.110> doing<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.709> medium<00:03:29.010> boats<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
time I've been doing the medium boats I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.210 
time I've been doing the medium boats I
usually<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.739> low<00:03:31.890> level

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
usually just just do the the low level

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.620 
usually just just do the the low level
tier<00:03:32.459> boat<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.970> tends<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.600> a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
tier boat because it tends to be a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.240 
tier boat because it tends to be a
little<00:03:33.810> bit<00:03:33.959> quicker<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.320> for<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.769> video<00:03:35.040> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250

little<00:06:47.800> thing<00:06:48.039> here<00:06:48.189> and<00:06:48.519> the<00:06:48.789> other<00:06:48.909> you<00:06:49.389> had

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
little thing here and the other you had

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.689 
little thing here and the other you had
the<00:06:49.569> too<00:06:49.689> little<00:06:49.869> range<00:06:50.769> things<00:06:51.039> as<00:06:51.129> well<00:06:51.309> so<00:06:51.669> I

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
the too little range things as well so I

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.639 
the too little range things as well so I
what<00:06:52.029> free<00:06:52.209> void<00:06:52.749> night<00:06:52.959> points<00:06:53.319> instead<00:06:53.589> of

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:53.649 
what free void night points instead of

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.129 
what free void night points instead of
two<00:06:53.830> and<00:06:54.269> we<00:06:55.269> go<00:06:55.389> as<00:06:55.449> a<00:06:55.539> pop-up<00:06:55.779> thing<00:06:55.959> there

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
two and we go as a pop-up thing there

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.290 
two and we go as a pop-up thing there
and<00:06:56.169> I<00:06:56.319> got<00:06:56.439> 700<00:06:56.979> instead<00:06:57.550> of<00:06:57.639> 600<00:06:57.849> so<00:06:58.149> it's<00:06:58.269> a

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
and I got 700 instead of 600 so it's a

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.399 
and I got 700 instead of 600 so it's a
little<00:06:58.419> bit<00:06:58.599> more<00:06:58.719> money<00:06:58.869> as<00:06:59.019> well<00:06:59.139> which<00:06:59.319> is
