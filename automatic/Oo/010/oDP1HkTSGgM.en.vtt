00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
woman and that represents another aspect

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
woman and that represents another aspect
of<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.280> card<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.849> necessity<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.569> making<00:02:28.810> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
of the card the necessity of making a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.710 
of the card the necessity of making a
choice<00:02:29.590> often<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.760> choice<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> young

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
choice often that choice is the young

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.600 
choice often that choice is the young
man<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.260> an<00:02:32.349> old<00:02:32.500> woman<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.069> young<00:02:33.099> woman

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
man and an old woman and a young woman

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.640 
man and an old woman and a young woman
so<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.060> choice<00:02:34.269> between<00:02:34.349> what<00:02:35.349> they<00:02:35.440> call

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
so it's a choice between what they call

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.119 
so it's a choice between what they call
sacred<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.519> profane<00:02:37.090> love<00:02:37.620> meaning<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:39.010> know

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
sacred and profane love meaning you know

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.059 
sacred and profane love meaning you know
sensuality<00:02:39.940> versus<00:02:40.390> wisdom<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.260> suppose<00:02:41.650> but

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
sensuality versus wisdom I suppose but

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.860 
sensuality versus wisdom I suppose but
do<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.400> know<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.730> that's<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.299> basic<00:02:43.720> idea

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
do you know that that's the basic idea

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.110 
do you know that that's the basic idea
but<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.829> can<00:02:44.980> see<00:02:45.129> in<00:02:45.220> many<00:02:45.370> more<00:02:45.670> modern

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
