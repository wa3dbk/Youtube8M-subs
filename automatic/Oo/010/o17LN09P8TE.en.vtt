suppressor<00:03:00.620> attached<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.370> get<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.520> reduction

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
suppressor attached to get a reduction

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.670 
suppressor attached to get a reduction
in<00:03:02.180> your<00:03:02.270> vertical<00:03:02.660> recoil<00:03:02.810> pretty<00:03:03.230> good

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
in your vertical recoil pretty good

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.380 
in your vertical recoil pretty good
reduction<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.280> your<00:03:04.370> accuracy<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.880> no<00:03:05.090> longer

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
reduction in your accuracy is no longer

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.570 
reduction in your accuracy is no longer
been<00:03:05.540> reduced<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.500> guns<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.340> be<00:03:07.370> pretty

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
been reduced so guns can be pretty

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.640 
been reduced so guns can be pretty
accurate<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.240> you're<00:03:08.690> gonna<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:09.080> little

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
accurate and you're gonna have little

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.010 
accurate and you're gonna have little
recoil<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> gun<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.640> m416<00:03:11.090> really

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
recoil on the gun and the m416 really

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.600 
recoil on the gun and the m416 really
didn't<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.590> much<00:03:12.860> recoil<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.400> start

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
didn't have that much recoil to start

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.670 
didn't have that much recoil to start
out<00:03:13.730> with<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> mean<00:03:14.300> had<00:03:14.570> some<00:03:14.810> all<00:03:15.080> guns<00:03:15.440> do

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
out with it I mean had some all guns do

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.710 
out with it I mean had some all guns do
but<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.550> really<00:03:16.730> wasn't<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.120> bad<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.630> was

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
but it really wasn't that bad it was

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.690 
but it really wasn't that bad it was
nothing<00:03:18.110> like<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> famas<00:03:19.010> kind<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.370> recoil

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
nothing like like a famas kind of recoil

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.580 
nothing like like a famas kind of recoil
when<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.940> first<00:03:20.150> start<00:03:20.390> out<00:03:20.450> with<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:20.989> it's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
when you first start out with it so it's

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.900 
when you first start out with it so it's
definitely<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:22.190> gun<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:22.670> easily

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
definitely a gun that's easily

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.550 
definitely a gun that's easily
controllable<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.900> flash<00:03:24.140> suppressor

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
controllable and that flash suppressor

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.780 
controllable and that flash suppressor
attachment<00:03:24.950> on<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.519> gonna<00:03:25.610> make

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
attachment on there is just gonna make

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.060 
attachment on there is just gonna make
it<00:03:25.940> even<00:03:26.180> better<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.600> find<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.980> a

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
it even better I find that this is a

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.460 
it even better I find that this is a
setup<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:29.180> really<00:03:29.480> in<00:03:29.630> close<00:03:29.750> quarters<00:03:30.200> I

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
setup that really in close quarters I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.140 
setup that really in close quarters I
love<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.220> right<00:03:31.340> here<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.580> decided<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> go

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
love and right here I decided to go

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.790 
love and right here I decided to go
ahead<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.360> put<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> mass<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.170> we<00:03:33.650> had

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
ahead and put the mass on here we had

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.199 
ahead and put the mass on here we had
enough<00:03:34.010> medics<00:03:34.370> around<00:03:34.670> running<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.060> med

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
enough medics around running the med

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.750 
enough medics around running the med
pack<00:03:35.450> that's<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.280> feel<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.519> didn't

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
pack that's that I feel like I didn't

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.100 
pack that's that I feel like I didn't
need<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.000> then<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:38.780> keep<00:03:39.019> a

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
need it and then just just keep a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.000

found it's the flash suppressor is gonna

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.030 
found it's the flash suppressor is gonna
be<00:04:11.959> over<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.290> heavy<00:04:12.440> barrel<00:04:12.590> when<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:12.920> comes

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
be over the heavy barrel when it comes

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.830 
be over the heavy barrel when it comes
to<00:04:13.130> close<00:04:13.340> quarters<00:04:13.700> Maps<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.239> really<00:04:14.720> the

because<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.970> heavy<00:04:21.150> barrel<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:21.630> their

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
because the heavy barrel is their

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.689 
because the heavy barrel is their
four-year<00:04:22.560> long<00:04:22.770> range<00:04:23.009> fights<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.490> if<00:04:23.550> your

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
four-year long range fights and if your

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.999 
four-year long range fights and if your

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
if your fore grip reduces your aim

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.120 
if your fore grip reduces your aim
accuracy<00:04:26.610> then<00:04:27.350> you're<00:04:28.350> almost<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:28.979> way

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
accuracy then you're almost in a way

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.830 
accuracy then you're almost in a way
offsetting<00:04:29.639> your<00:04:29.729> heavy<00:04:29.910> barrel<00:04:30.240> I'll<00:04:30.419> think

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
offsetting your heavy barrel I'll think

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.300 
offsetting your heavy barrel I'll think
the<00:04:30.960> he<00:04:31.110> bear<00:04:31.289> will<00:04:31.440> kind<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.949> little<00:04:32.220> bit

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
the he bear will kind of a little bit

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.640 
the he bear will kind of a little bit
overtake<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.849> grip<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.990> find<00:04:34.380> it's<00:04:34.500> better

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
overtake the grip but I find it's better

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.110 
overtake the grip but I find it's better
if<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.889> just<00:04:34.919> take<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> grip<00:04:35.520> off<00:04:35.669> completely

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
if you just take the grip off completely

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.659 
if you just take the grip off completely
because<00:04:36.599> they<00:04:36.930> have<00:04:37.199> reduced<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.949> recoil<00:04:38.430> on

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
because they have reduced the recoil on

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.120 
because they have reduced the recoil on
the<00:04:38.819> heavy<00:04:39.030> barrel<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:40.169> basically<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
the heavy barrel that basically for the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.499 
the heavy barrel that basically for the
penalty<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.520> having<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.910> barrel<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.240> there

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
penalty for having the barrel on there

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.140 
penalty for having the barrel on there

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
yes suppression in this game is just

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.189 
yes suppression in this game is just
completely<00:04:47.250> out<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.400> whack<00:04:47.610> but<00:04:48.090> why<00:04:48.660> why<00:04:49.020> did

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
completely out of whack but why why did

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.020 
completely out of whack but why why did
they<00:04:49.229> mess<00:04:49.470> with<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.740> was<00:04:50.130> fine<00:04:50.340> before<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.940> my

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
they mess with it was fine before in my

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.400 
they mess with it was fine before in my
opinion<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.419> totally<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.990> out<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.199> control

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
opinion is totally just out of control

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.830 
opinion is totally just out of control
and<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:53.849> ridiculous<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.570> if<00:04:54.720> you

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and it's just ridiculous and if you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.480 
and it's just ridiculous and if you
you're<00:04:55.380> gonna<00:04:55.500> die<00:04:55.770> if<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.070> guy<00:04:56.190> starts

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
you're gonna die if a guy starts

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.710 
you're gonna die if a guy starts
shooting<00:04:56.729> at<00:04:56.789> you<00:04:56.970> unless<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.419> hold<00:04:57.599> the
