have<00:01:07.590> EAD<00:01:08.040> GBE<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> instead<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.170> drop<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.310> D

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
have EAD GBE so instead you drop the D

have EAD GBE so instead you drop the D
down<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.270> e<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> D<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.369> tune<00:01:14.580> the

down the e to the D and you tune the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.350 
down the e to the D and you tune the
same<00:01:14.970> intervals<00:01:15.770> okay<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> little

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
same intervals okay so it's a little

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
same intervals okay so it's a little
heavier<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.650> also<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.280> thing<00:01:20.369> about
