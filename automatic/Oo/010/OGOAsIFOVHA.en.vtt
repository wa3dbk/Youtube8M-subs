I'll show you how to get it first when I
show<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.300> different<00:00:40.040> changes<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.700> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
show you two different changes that are

really<00:00:42.059> fun<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:42.989> involves

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
really fun but the first one involves

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
really fun but the first one involves
link<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.629> fit<00:00:46.320> link<00:00:46.559> motion<00:00:46.950> pack<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.620> then

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
link so fit link motion pack and then

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.760 
link so fit link motion pack and then
the<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.629> fit<00:00:51.629> Diddy<00:00:51.870> motion<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.530> now

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the other one fit Diddy motion back now

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
the other one fit Diddy motion back now
why<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> open<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
why I have to open is so that i can

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.979 
why I have to open is so that i can
compare<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.899> contrast<00:00:55.309> each<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
compare and contrast each one like I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.860 
compare and contrast each one like I
don't<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.460> open<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.940> huge

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
don't have to open it that's a huge

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.359 
don't have to open it that's a huge
asset<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.469> bra<00:01:01.920> box<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.430> PSA<00:01:02.760> did<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.030> have

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
asset for bra box that PSA did not have

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
asset for bra box that PSA did not have
so<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.640> link<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.619> believe<00:01:07.619> his<00:01:07.860> arrow<00:01:09.020> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so on link i believe his arrow it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
so on link i believe his arrow it's
under<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.560> fit<00:01:11.130> link<00:01:11.430> etc<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:12.630> one

under this fit link etc the other one

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
under this fit link etc the other one
that<00:01:13.020> everyone<00:01:13.229> has<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> fit<00:01:14.010> link<00:01:14.280> motion<00:01:14.790> or

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that everyone has is fit link motion or

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
that everyone has is fit link motion or

it<00:03:11.880> looks<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> weird<00:03:12.359> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.810> tell<00:03:12.989> it's

a<00:03:13.170> peanut<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.060> right<00:03:15.060> now<00:03:15.239> I'm<00:03:15.390> not<00:03:15.540> sure<00:03:15.750> how

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
a peanut but right now I'm not sure how

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.360 
a peanut but right now I'm not sure how
to<00:03:15.930> actually<00:03:16.140> do<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.709> think<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.040> might

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
to actually do this and I think it might

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.170 
to actually do this and I think it might
be<00:03:17.570> partially<00:03:18.570> because<00:03:18.750> Diddy's<00:03:19.290> peanut<00:03:19.680> is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
be partially because Diddy's peanut is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.690 
be partially because Diddy's peanut is
also<00:03:21.180> an<00:03:21.299> item<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:23.220> one<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.430> those<00:03:23.489> weird

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
also an item it's one of those weird

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.039 
also an item it's one of those weird
ones<00:03:23.940> because<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.810> catch

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
ones because you can kind of catch
