pitch black 392 weapon it's a weapon
that<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.589> build<00:00:07.859> from<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.550> blueprint<00:00:09.030> so

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
that you can build from a blueprint so

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.589 
that you can build from a blueprint so
it<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> stasis<00:00:11.010> amplified<00:00:11.700> chain<00:00:12.059> gun<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
it is a stasis amplified chain gun and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530 
it is a stasis amplified chain gun and
fourth<00:00:12.900> gun<00:00:13.170> modified<00:00:14.099> slow<00:00:14.519> enemies<00:00:14.849> down

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
fourth gun modified slow enemies down

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.349 
fourth gun modified slow enemies down
which<00:00:15.900> each<00:00:16.170> shot<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.130> sounds<00:00:17.880> pretty<00:00:18.119> cool

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
which each shot so sounds pretty cool

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.210 
which each shot so sounds pretty cool
may<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.660> take<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> look<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.289> baby<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.890> action

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
may I take a look at this baby in action

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.390 
may I take a look at this baby in action
against<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.180> living<00:00:21.510> Necromorphs<00:00:25.400> so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
against some living Necromorphs so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.810 
against some living Necromorphs so
before<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.119> start<00:00:27.539> uh<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.859> magazine<00:00:29.340> size<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
before we start uh the magazine size is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
before we start uh the magazine size is
a<00:00:30.830> 124<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.270> primary<00:00:33.270> firing<00:00:33.780> mode<00:00:34.250> that's<00:00:35.250> for

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
a 124 the primary firing mode that's for

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.540 
a 124 the primary firing mode that's for
the<00:00:35.579> alternate<00:00:36.300> mode<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.219> twenty<00:00:40.550> reload

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the alternate mode it is twenty reload

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
the alternate mode it is twenty reload
speed<00:00:41.879> seems<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.570> take<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:43.110> two<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> three

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
speed seems to take about two to three

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.690 
speed seems to take about two to three
seconds<00:00:46.489> accuracy<00:00:47.930> okay<00:00:48.930> ish<00:00:49.370> seems<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
seconds accuracy okay ish seems to have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.110 
seconds accuracy okay ish seems to have
a<00:00:50.730> pretty<00:00:51.210> big<00:00:51.300> spread<00:00:52.340> long<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.670> long<00:00:53.820> range

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a pretty big spread long for long range

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.240 
a pretty big spread long for long range
so<00:00:54.510> say<00:00:55.140> maybe<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.620> gonna<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:56.039> pretty

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so say maybe there's gonna be pretty

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
so say maybe there's gonna be pretty
good<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.699> mid<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> short-range<00:01:00.109> fire<00:01:01.109> rate

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
good for mid and short-range fire rate

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
good for mid and short-range fire rate
as<00:01:01.590> Estevez<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> pretty<00:01:03.120> off<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
as Estevez can see it's pretty off the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.170 
as Estevez can see it's pretty off the
chart<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> let's<00:01:05.760> spawn<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.299> monsters<00:01:08.180> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
chart so let's spawn some monsters and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
chart so let's spawn some monsters and
yeah<00:01:10.170> every<00:01:10.560> shot<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.040> fire<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
yeah every shot that you fire this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
yeah every shot that you fire this
weapon<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> chance<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> slow<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> enemy

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
weapon has a chance to slow the enemy

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.390 
weapon has a chance to slow the enemy
down<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.680> turn

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
down so you will probably see them turn

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.870 
down so you will probably see them turn
blue<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> time

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.230 

and<00:01:24.880> yeah<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:26.730> dimensions<00:01:27.730> are<00:01:27.850> we<00:01:27.940> pretty

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and yeah the dimensions are we pretty

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.940 
and yeah the dimensions are we pretty
decent<00:01:29.170> -<00:01:30.660> yeah<00:01:31.660> they<00:01:31.810> have<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:31.960> really<00:01:32.680> really

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
decent - yeah they have a really really

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.360 
decent - yeah they have a really really
hard<00:01:33.340> time<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.850> get<00:01:33.970> close<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.390> me<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.830> if<00:01:36.220> they

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
hard time to get close to me and if they

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.070 
hard time to get close to me and if they
do<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.090> can<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.510> use<00:01:37.750> your<00:01:37.780> D

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
do like you can just use your D

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.800 
do like you can just use your D
alternate<00:01:38.650> mode<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.220> knock<00:01:40.150> them<00:01:40.330> down<00:01:40.510> on<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
alternate mode to knock them down on the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.140 
alternate mode to knock them down on the
floor<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.890> finish<00:01:42.250> them<00:01:42.430> off

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
a blueprint you will get all of its

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.610 
a blueprint you will get all of its
included<00:02:40.060> parts<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.840> for<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.260> attachment

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
included parts so so for the attachment

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.699 
included parts so so for the attachment
one<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.460> these<00:02:45.640> Dacia<00:02:46.120> simplifier<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.140> is

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
one you get these Dacia simplifier it is

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.900 
one you get these Dacia simplifier it is
a<00:02:48.150> station<00:02:49.150> shots<00:02:49.540> have<00:02:49.900> larger<00:02:50.350> radius

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
a station shots have larger radius

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.880 
a station shots have larger radius
attachment<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.090> these<00:02:52.420> stasis<00:02:52.870> coating<00:02:53.290> it

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
attachment to these stasis coating it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
attachment to these stasis coating it
coats<00:02:54.220> your<00:02:54.310> projectiles<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> very<00:02:55.480> small

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
coats your projectiles with a very small

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.380 
coats your projectiles with a very small
amount<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.110> stasis<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:56.680> every<00:02:57.120> bullet<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.180> true

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
amount of stasis so every bullet a true

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.630 
amount of stasis so every bullet a true
fire<00:02:58.660> will<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.050> chance<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.830> slow<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
fire will have a chance to slow the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.270 
fire will have a chance to slow the
