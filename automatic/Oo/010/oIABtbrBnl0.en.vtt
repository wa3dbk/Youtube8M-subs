they're<00:00:32.150> really<00:00:32.599> new<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.050> for<00:00:33.590> some<00:00:33.770> reason

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
they're really new but for some reason

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.760 
they're really new but for some reason
one<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.580> my<00:00:34.699> targets<00:00:35.210> put<00:00:35.570> them<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:35.989> clearance

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
one of my targets put them on clearance

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.460 
one of my targets put them on clearance
and<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.790> did<00:00:37.970> another<00:00:38.239> one<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.570> my<00:00:38.690> targets<00:00:39.170> for

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
and so did another one of my targets for

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.640 
and so did another one of my targets for
488<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.120> I'm<00:00:41.449> not<00:00:41.629> really<00:00:41.690> sure<00:00:41.960> why<00:00:42.379> they're

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
488 so I'm not really sure why they're

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.110 
488 so I'm not really sure why they're
on<00:00:42.800> clearance<00:00:43.070> right<00:00:43.430> now<00:00:43.610> since<00:00:43.820> they<00:00:44.059> were

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
on clearance right now since they were

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.200 
on clearance right now since they were
just<00:00:44.449> released<00:00:44.900> um<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.489> think<00:00:46.729> I<00:00:46.909> still

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
just released um but I think I still

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.700 
just released um but I think I still
think<00:00:47.420> it's<00:00:47.540> a<00:00:47.629> really<00:00:47.780> great<00:00:48.050> deal<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.620> get

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
think it's a really great deal to get

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.520 
think it's a really great deal to get
them<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.949> little<00:00:49.220> bit<00:00:49.460> cheaper<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:50.420> got<00:00:51.140> this

of<00:03:42.200> can't<00:03:42.410> see<00:03:42.560> through<00:03:42.739> them<00:03:42.920> but<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.730> think

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
of can't see through them but I think

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.390 
of can't see through them but I think
that's<00:03:44.090> really<00:03:44.330> cool<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.770> actually<00:03:46.190> pretty

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
that's really cool and actually pretty

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.850 
that's really cool and actually pretty
realistic<00:03:46.849> on<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.390> outside<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:48.530> all<00:03:48.709> the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
realistic on the outside like all the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.470 
realistic on the outside like all the
little<00:03:49.069> details<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.090> does<00:03:50.239> have<00:03:50.270> a

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
little details on it and it does have a

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.839 
little details on it and it does have a
little<00:03:50.780> stream<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:51.560> if<00:03:51.830> you<00:03:52.340> want<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.700> can

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
little stream so if you want you can

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.839 
little stream so if you want you can
untie<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.360> put<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.020> on<00:03:54.230> your<00:03:54.349> dog's<00:03:54.590> neck<00:03:54.860> so

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
untie that put it on your dog's neck so

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.650 
untie that put it on your dog's neck so
it<00:03:56.150> can<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:56.450> hang<00:03:56.750> off<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.319> they<00:03:58.160> do<00:03:58.220> like
