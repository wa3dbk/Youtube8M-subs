00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
does before I put it in the bug I'm

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.560 
does before I put it in the bug I'm
still<00:00:46.610> working<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> bug<00:00:48.000> though<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.240> still

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
still working on the bug though I still

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.050 
still working on the bug though I still
got<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:48.810> get<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> transmission<00:00:49.680> out<00:00:49.830> I've<00:00:50.760> got

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
got to get the transmission out I've got

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.500 
got to get the transmission out I've got
it<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.450> unbolt<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.560> ready<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.310> pull<00:00:53.490> out<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it all unbolt it ready to pull out and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.140 
it all unbolt it ready to pull out and
while<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.590> doing<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.000> discovered<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
while I was doing that discovered the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.590 
while I was doing that discovered the
transaxles<00:00:58.050> were<00:00:58.200> in<00:00:58.320> pretty<00:00:58.560> bad<00:00:58.740> shape<00:00:58.800> so

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
transaxles were in pretty bad shape so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300 
transaxles were in pretty bad shape so
I'm<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> replace<00:01:01.140> those<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
I'm going to replace those and the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.149 
I'm going to replace those and the
transmission<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.379> clean<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
transmission and clean it all up and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.420 
transmission and clean it all up and
it's<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.700> mess<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> once<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> get

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's kind of a mess so once I get

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.820 
it's kind of a mess so once I get
everything<00:01:08.520> back<00:01:08.940> together<00:01:09.090> it'll<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
everything back together it'll be a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.640 
everything back together it'll be a
really<00:01:10.830> good<00:01:10.950> running<00:01:11.220> bug<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.440> be<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
really good running bug and will be in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.300 
really good running bug and will be in
good<00:01:13.830> shape<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.880> uh<00:01:15.650> engine<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.070> nice

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
good shape but uh engine is really nice

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.680 
good shape but uh engine is really nice
I'm<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.850> impressed<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
I'm really impressed with it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.640 
I'm really impressed with it
it's<00:01:18.870> an<00:01:19.050> 1835<00:01:19.979> turn<00:01:20.370> key<00:01:20.990> with<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> serpentine

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's an 1835 turn key with a serpentine

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's an 1835 turn key with a serpentine
belt<00:01:22.710> dual<00:01:23.430> carbs<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:26.210> added<00:01:27.210> an<00:01:27.300> oil<00:01:27.479> filter

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
belt dual carbs and added an oil filter

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.399 
belt dual carbs and added an oil filter
on<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> adapter<00:01:30.110> maybe<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
on there with the adapter maybe that's a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.060 
on there with the adapter maybe that's a
good<00:01:31.440> investment

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.450 

here's<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> old<00:01:35.490> motor<00:01:36.229> cleaned<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here's the old motor cleaned it up it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.680 
here's the old motor cleaned it up it
was<00:01:38.760> covered<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.900> oil<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.120> still<00:01:42.510> in<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
was covered in oil so I'm still in the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.070 
was covered in oil so I'm still in the
process<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.229> tearing<00:01:43.620> it<00:01:43.740> down<00:01:44.780> got<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> pull

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
process of tearing it down got to pull

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.280 
process of tearing it down got to pull
the<00:01:46.260> piston<00:01:46.770> heads<00:01:47.159> off<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.869> break<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.080> seal

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the piston heads off and break the seal

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.410 
the piston heads off and break the seal
of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.100> case<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.760> see<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> looks

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
of the the case and see what it looks

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.740 
of the the case and see what it looks
like<00:01:51.479> inside<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:53.150> depending<00:01:54.150> on<00:01:54.299> how<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like inside and depending on how it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.560 
like inside and depending on how it
turns<00:01:55.260> out<00:01:55.590> we'll<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:56.970> kind<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> rebuild

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
turns out we'll see what kind of rebuild

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.940 
turns out we'll see what kind of rebuild
kit<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.900> need<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> uh<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.380> crane<00:02:01.680> is

I'm<00:02:19.709> gonna<00:02:20.159> do<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> couple<00:02:20.580> different<00:02:20.819> setups

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
I'm gonna do a couple different setups

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.100 
I'm gonna do a couple different setups
and<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.250> thought<00:02:23.400> I'd<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.000> need<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> bench

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and I thought I'd have I need a bench

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.920 
and I thought I'd have I need a bench
that<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.409> can<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:26.220> everything<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.879> need<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.659> by

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that I can do everything I need to do by

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.420 
that I can do everything I need to do by
myself<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.650> don't<00:02:28.709> want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.159> rely<00:02:29.400> on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
myself I don't want to have to rely on

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.369 
myself I don't want to have to rely on
people<00:02:30.330> coming<00:02:30.629> over<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.900> help<00:02:31.049> me<00:02:31.230> lift

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
people coming over and help me lift

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.850 
people coming over and help me lift
motors<00:02:31.799> up<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.190> down<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:33.739> thought<00:02:34.739> this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
motors up and down and I thought this

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.170 
motors up and down and I thought this
was<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.160> good<00:02:35.280> way<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.489> do<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.819> I'm<00:02:35.970> really

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
was a good way to do it I'm really

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
was a good way to do it I'm really
impressed<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.959> crane<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.890> it's

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
impressed with that crane and it's

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.990 
impressed with that crane and it's
really<00:02:38.640> neat<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:40.370> worked<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.760> well

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
really neat and worked out really well

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
really neat and worked out really well
it<00:02:42.030> lifted<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.720> thing<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it lifted that thing right out of the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.240 
it lifted that thing right out of the
crate<00:02:43.890> no<00:02:44.190> effort<00:02:44.849> at<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:47.069> was<00:02:47.129> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
crate no effort at all and it was a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.430 
crate no effort at all and it was a
piece<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.790> cake<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.239> mount<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.049> engine

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
piece of cake to mount it to the engine

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.509 
piece of cake to mount it to the engine
stand<00:02:49.970> turned<00:02:50.970> out<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.329> nice<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:53.010> I'm<00:02:53.430> in

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
stand turned out really nice so I'm in

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.400 
stand turned out really nice so I'm in
the<00:02:53.610> process<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.269> getting<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the process now of getting the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.309 
the process now of getting the
components<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.459> need<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.879> wire<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.870> thing<00:02:57.930> up

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
components I need to wire this thing up

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.470 
components I need to wire this thing up
I've<00:02:58.530> got<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> wiring<00:02:58.950> diagram<00:02:59.810> I'll<00:03:00.859> show<00:03:01.859> that

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
I've got a wiring diagram I'll show that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.339 
I've got a wiring diagram I'll show that
probably<00:03:03.480> show<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.599> at<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> beginning<00:03:04.230> of

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
probably show it at the beginning of

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.059 
probably show it at the beginning of
this<00:03:04.470> video<00:03:06.140> I've<00:03:07.140> got<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:07.410> switches<00:03:07.859> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
this video I've got my switches the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.170 
this video I've got my switches the
wires<00:03:08.280> everything<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.060> need<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.269> hook<00:03:09.540> up<00:03:11.180> this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
wires everything I need to hook up this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.770 
wires everything I need to hook up this
is<00:03:12.390> actually<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> original<00:03:13.579> starter<00:03:14.780> from

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
is actually the original starter from

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.080 
is actually the original starter from
there<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:19.049> cleaned<00:03:19.319> up<00:03:19.500> really<00:03:19.680> nice<00:03:20.090> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
there and it cleaned up really nice it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.690 
there and it cleaned up really nice it
looks<00:03:21.359> brand-new<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.739> bell<00:03:22.950> housing<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.519> got

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
looks brand-new the bell housing I got

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.809 
looks brand-new the bell housing I got
off<00:03:23.849> eBay<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.480> wasn't<00:03:24.870> old<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.700> came

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
off a bus and it was pretty nasty I

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.909 
off a bus and it was pretty nasty I

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
cleaned it up too and painted it and it

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.550 
cleaned it up too and painted it and it
turned<00:03:32.280> out<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:32.459> nice<00:03:33.200> mounted<00:03:34.200> right<00:03:34.380> up

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
turned out really nice mounted right up

turned out really nice mounted right up
to<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.799> engine<00:03:35.040> stand<00:03:35.340> four<00:03:35.669> bolts<00:03:36.380> secure

to go I'll do another video and let's
see<00:03:56.669> how<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.940> sounds<00:03:56.970> I've<00:03:57.450> got<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:59.299> this<00:04:00.470> one<00:04:01.470> in

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
see how it sounds I've got a this one in

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.229 
see how it sounds I've got a this one in
five<00:04:01.829> eighths<00:04:02.069> pipe<00:04:02.400> I'm<00:04:02.669> I<00:04:02.879> can't<00:04:03.120> remember

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
five eighths pipe I'm I can't remember

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.420 
five eighths pipe I'm I can't remember
now<00:04:03.389> it's<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.720> bigger<00:04:03.900> exhaust<00:04:04.560> pipe<00:04:04.829> with<00:04:05.400> a

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
now it's the bigger exhaust pipe with a

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.539 
now it's the bigger exhaust pipe with a
stinger<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.560> I'll<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.310> hooked

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
stinger on it and I'll get that hooked

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.180 
stinger on it and I'll get that hooked
up<00:04:08.700> too<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:10.500> now<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.739> got<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.099> work
