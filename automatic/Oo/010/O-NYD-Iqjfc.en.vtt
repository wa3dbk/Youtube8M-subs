morphtronic<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.109> add<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:02.250> coming<00:01:02.579> from

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
morphtronic and you add more coming from

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
morphtronic and you add more coming from
attacked<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.300> hand<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.780> has<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> same

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
attacked in your hand that has the same

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.600 
attacked in your hand that has the same
level<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.320> plus<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> with

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
level so it's a plus one and with
machine<00:01:08.970> duplication<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.710> if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
machine duplication you can do this if

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
machine duplication you can do this if
you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.250> three<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.610> chronic<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.600> Your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you have three more chronic on Your

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
you have three more chronic on Your
Grave<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> tree<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
Grave you can do this tree down so you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
Grave you can do this tree down so you
get<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> plus<00:01:15.090> 3<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:17.000> troponin<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.920> goes<00:01:20.159> for

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
get a plus 3 and troponin it goes for

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
get a plus 3 and troponin it goes for
gain<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.600> attack<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.140> opponent

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
gain because can attack your opponent

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.740 
gain because can attack your opponent
directly<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.560> use<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> machine<00:01:26.280> duplication

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
directly and I use a machine duplication

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.390 
directly and I use a machine duplication
so<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:30.140> scopin<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.950> scopin

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
so it's really good to scopin to scopin

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
so it's really good to scopin to scopin
because<00:01:32.790> i<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.119> special<00:01:33.509> summon<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
because i can special summon it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.569 
because i can special summon it
especially<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> bug<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.299> so

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
especially it's like a bug or not so

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
especially it's like a bug or not so
it's<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.659> defense<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it's really good and in defense is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.249 
it's really good and in defense is
little<00:01:40.710> before<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.250> i<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.939> look<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.049> l

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
little before so i can go for look at l

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.210 
little before so i can go for look at l
eight<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:44.310> start<00:01:44.640> us<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.780> scrub<00:01:46.740> darien

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
eight like start us or and scrub darien

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
eight like start us or and scrub darien
and<00:01:48.049> then<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:50.009> boomboxen<00:01:50.670> i<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> using

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and then to boomboxen i don't like using

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
and then to boomboxen i don't like using
tripley's<00:01:53.159> cuz<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.990> two<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.130> two<00:01:56.490> cuz

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
tripley's cuz in two of these two cuz

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.820 
tripley's cuz in two of these two cuz
they're<00:01:58.189> not<00:01:59.189> good<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> draw<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
they're not good to draw and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.490 
they're not good to draw and
so<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:04.080> defense

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so it was two of these and in defense

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.749 
so it was two of these and in defense
keep<00:02:05.310> blocking<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.760> deck<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:07.759> attack

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
keep blocking the deck and in attack

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.470 
keep blocking the deck and in attack
position<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.410> attack<00:02:10.560> twice<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.480> with

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
position he can attack twice and with

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.790 
position he can attack twice and with
united<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.200> stand<00:02:13.260> his<00:02:13.680> game<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.440> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.620> can

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
running too because you can tribute one

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.460 
running too because you can tribute one
or<00:02:30.240> turning<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.630> destroy<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.110> card<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
or turning to destroy one card on the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.080 
or turning to destroy one card on the
field<00:02:31.500> except<00:02:32.250> him<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:34.430> don't<00:02:35.430> really<00:02:35.670> use

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
field except him so I don't really use

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.670 
field except him so I don't really use
this<00:02:36.510> much<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.080> fence<00:02:40.320> if

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
this much but I use it in the fence if
