we could talk about soft
coverage<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.500> blowing<00:02:13.740> coverages<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.670> this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
coverage and blowing coverages and this

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.520 
coverage and blowing coverages and this
and<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.240> prevent<00:02:15.690> defense<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.350> all<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and that prevent defense and all the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.560 
and that prevent defense and all the
reasons<00:02:16.680> why<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.400> may<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.820> happen<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
reasons why it may have happen but it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720 
reasons why it may have happen but it
continues<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.080> happen<00:02:19.230> every<00:02:20.190> day<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
continues to happen every day and I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330 
continues to happen every day and I
think<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.240> hard<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.900> explain<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.220> we

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
think it's very hard to explain and we

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.160 
think it's very hard to explain and we
talked<00:02:23.550> about<00:02:23.670> scope<00:02:23.970> week<00:02:24.180> weeks<00:02:24.570> ago<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
power of a team yes and the power of one

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.030 
power of a team yes and the power of one
person<00:02:29.430> getting<00:02:30.200> fifty<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.440> others<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.980> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
person getting fifty two others in a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.190 
person getting fifty two others in a
coaching<00:02:32.460> staff<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.180> believe<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:34.020> inner

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
coaching staff to believe they are inner

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.050 
coaching staff to believe they are inner
than<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:35.880> it's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
than they really are and I think it's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
than they really are and I think it's
very<00:02:36.150> hard<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.540> explain<00:02:36.720> will<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:38.190> will<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> a
