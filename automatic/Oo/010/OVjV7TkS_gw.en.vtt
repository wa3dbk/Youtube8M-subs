00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.820
Oh, he's strong

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.120
That's a nice fish

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.560
You need help?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.800
He's beautiful

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.440
And heavy

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.920
Yeah, that's a nice fish

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.900
Pretty nice size

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.840
He's a happy camper

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.660
He's over 50 cm!

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.860
Nice

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.280
Beautiful fish

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.100
Really dark

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.580
That didn't look like a grayling

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.660
Cool

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.420
He's going again

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.220
I think it's a pike

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.280
A pike on a dry fly!

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.720
A purple Klinkhamer

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.460
That's a 4-5 kg fish

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.920
Can you help me grab it?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.176
Yeah, sure

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.920
5 kg pike on a Klinkhamer!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.580
There he is!
