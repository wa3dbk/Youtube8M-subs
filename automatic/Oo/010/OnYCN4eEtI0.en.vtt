more<00:00:51.690> unfriendly<00:00:52.320> hours<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:53.010> 3:00<00:00:53.339> in<00:00:53.429> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
more unfriendly hours like 3:00 in the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.459 
more unfriendly hours like 3:00 in the
morning<00:00:55.219> Taurus<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> fairly<00:00:56.609> easy<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.149> find

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
morning Taurus is fairly easy to find

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
morning Taurus is fairly easy to find
it's<00:00:58.469> west<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> constellation<00:00:59.820> Orion<00:00:59.969> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's west of the constellation Orion so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
it's west of the constellation Orion so
if<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.140> find<00:01:01.379> Orion<00:01:01.679> then<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:02.909> at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
if you can find Orion then you look at

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.090 
if you can find Orion then you look at
the<00:01:03.149> belt<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.659> Orion<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.769> three

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the belt in Orion and there's three

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
the belt in Orion and there's three
bright<00:01:05.339> stars<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.940> belt<00:01:06.300> draw<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> line

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bright stars in that belt draw a line

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
bright stars in that belt draw a line
through<00:01:08.070> those<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:08.580> stars<00:01:08.880> heading<00:01:09.360> west

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
through those three stars heading west

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.110 
through those three stars heading west
and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.440> will<00:01:10.590> immediately<00:01:10.980> come<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> Taurus

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
and you will immediately come to Taurus

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.060 
and you will immediately come to Taurus
when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.050> get<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> Taurus<00:01:13.650> you'll<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
when you get to Taurus you'll see a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
when you get to Taurus you'll see a
pattern<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> stars<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.750> shape<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.290> V

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
pattern of stars in the shape of a V

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760 
pattern of stars in the shape of a V
it's<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.400> easy<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> V

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's very easy to see and in that V

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.400 
it's very easy to see and in that V
you'll<00:01:20.370> see<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> bright<00:01:21.000> orange<00:01:21.390> red<00:01:21.720> star<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
you'll see a bright orange red star and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.840 
you'll see a bright orange red star and
that<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.190> Aldebaran<00:01:25.310> when<00:01:26.310> people<00:01:26.640> draw

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that would be Aldebaran when people draw

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
that would be Aldebaran when people draw
pictures<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> constellations<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.740> they'll

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
pictures of constellations like they'll

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.680 
pictures of constellations like they'll
draw<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.160> picture<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.850> bowl<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.300> Taurus

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
draw the picture of the bowl for Taurus

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.260 
draw the picture of the bowl for Taurus
they<00:01:31.260> usually<00:01:31.500> draw<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:31.980> such<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.370> Aldebaran

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
they usually draw it such that Aldebaran

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
they usually draw it such that Aldebaran
is<00:01:33.480> one<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> eyes<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> bowl<00:01:35.210> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is one of the eyes of the bowl but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.520 
is one of the eyes of the bowl but
actually<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.780> too<00:01:36.840> many<00:01:36.960> stars<00:01:37.290> out

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
actually there are too many stars out

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.560 
actually there are too many stars out
there<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.920> Aldebaran<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.910> in<00:01:39.180> some<00:01:39.390> ways

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there like Aldebaran so in some ways

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.650 
there like Aldebaran so in some ways
it's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.110> fairly<00:01:40.410> ordinary<00:01:40.770> star<00:01:41.570> nothing<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
it's a fairly ordinary star nothing to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's a fairly ordinary star nothing to
get<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.260> excited<00:01:43.830> about
