00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 cinnamon television rather a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.750
 well the theme of the day is this 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.429
 activity obviously worries miguel 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.620
 Herrera but the coach of the national team 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.230
 Roberto still has the 202 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 players that you think you can be 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010
 relevant players in a 2015 that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 It also has very important activity 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 for the mexican soccer team I think 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 I roberto that obviously the technician 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 national must have an ace up his sleeve 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 in this situation but I also think 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.300
 that taking into account the injury of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 Carlos watches the constant injuries 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 that they beat him later to giovani two 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 saints that mexico does not have so many 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.710
 front for obvious reasons because 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 here in Mexico they are covered by 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 foreigners then that's why 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 understand a little more this decision of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.280
 miguel herrera to continue counting on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 these two politicians but I 'm 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.579
 realities that will be in the next 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 gold cup because it's the tournament that goes 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 to put much higher demand and also 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.520
 obligation with that to get the pass 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 to the confederations cup of the year 2017 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 what is interesting is the theme that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.450
 they are different parties that remain of the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 Spanish league and I think if we see 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.960
 we make one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 use of what could be 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.160
 we will hardly see that more than half 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 could play the Mexicans are very 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.270
 behind benzema and on the subject of madrid 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 of chicharito hernÃ¡ndez and of course 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 fix us jimÃ©nez but you already have when 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 comes to the child towers as we saw it there 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 an information then something very complicated 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 that came to give future he is in the cup 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 gold and I think that there too 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.320
 the opportunity could be opened for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.550
 young people who are playing in Mexico and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 that can have a greater regularity 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.540
 these two will get dry without 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 irregular activity and with confidence or 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.710
 totally lost 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.479
 cougar herrera that we have surely 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 will start now from the high with 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.350
 America could be men 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.330
 important in the first team calling 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.770
 so that the buyer be right 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.930
 is that if we start doing an analysis 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 of the first division teams in 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 how many there are Mexican front centers 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.510
 or at least naturalized that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.610
 could help the selection there is no 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.750
 many and that complicates miguel herrera 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.310
 so he keeps counting on these 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.510
 players hopefully the rest of the year 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.619
 have some minutes but well what 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.930
 said Robert and nations in the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.430
 analysis in the previous difficult note in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.330
 the madrid is not only benzema there are several 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.060
 footballers who are above 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.590
 the ladder of players that go up there to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.420
 the ownership of the real team 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.950
 madrid while in the athletic raul 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.350
 jimÃ©nez although he has had some minutes 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.090
 recently he will not have many 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.090
