youtubers I suppose that several of you
have<00:00:03.870> already<00:00:04.680> bought<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.700> bridge<00:00:06.359> camera<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
have already bought a bridge camera and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.089 
have already bought a bridge camera and
have<00:00:08.580> noticed<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.480> fixed<00:00:09.900> flash<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.679> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
have noticed that the fixed flash is a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
have noticed that the fixed flash is a
little<00:00:11.370> bit<00:00:11.599> in<00:00:12.599> your<00:00:13.080> face<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.570> an

little bit in your face so here is an

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.349 
little bit in your face so here is an
interesting<00:00:16.609> experimentation<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
interesting experimentation of how to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
interesting experimentation of how to
handle<00:00:18.960> things<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> Beast<00:00:22.100> before

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
handle things here is the Beast before

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.420 
handle things here is the Beast before
the<00:00:23.430> operation<00:00:24.650> with<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.680> pop-up<00:00:26.220> flash

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the operation with the pop-up flash

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.370 
the operation with the pop-up flash
already<00:00:27.420> popped<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:29.029> yes<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.769> objective<00:00:33.380> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
already popped up yes the objective and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.850 
already popped up yes the objective and
there<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:34.880> we<00:00:35.880> shall<00:00:36.149> now<00:00:36.480> cover<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.200> in

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
there we are we shall now cover it in

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.740 
there we are we shall now cover it in
cling<00:00:38.190> film<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.629> covered<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
cling film so there we are covered in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.060 
cling film so there we are covered in
twinkle<00:00:43.460> ready<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> operation

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
twinkle ready for the operation

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
twinkle ready for the operation
evidently<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> clean<00:00:47.489> film<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.270> stop<00:00:48.539> any

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
evidently the clean film is to stop any

evidently the clean film is to stop any
water<00:00:49.469> getting<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> camera<00:00:51.090> you'll<00:00:51.930> see

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
water getting into the camera you'll see

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.540 
water getting into the camera you'll see
why

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.500 

so<00:00:56.450> here<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.020> are<00:00:57.050> with<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.250> plastic<00:00:59.060> and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
so here we are with the plastic and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.250 
so here we are with the plastic and
modely<00:01:00.170> yes<00:01:01.360> evidently<00:01:03.280> malleable<00:01:04.280> plastic

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
modely yes evidently malleable plastic

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210 
modely yes evidently malleable plastic
which<00:01:06.260> one<00:01:06.560> can<00:01:07.060> purchase<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.830> one<00:01:10.010> was

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
which one can purchase and this one was

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.120 
which one can purchase and this one was
not<00:01:10.430> very<00:01:10.700> expensive<00:01:11.060> at<00:01:11.540> 1<00:01:11.810> euro<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.620> 20

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
not very expensive at 1 euro and 20

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.350 
not very expensive at 1 euro and 20
saltines<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.700> says<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:18.170> French<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
saltines so it says in French that you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.910 
saltines so it says in French that you
can<00:01:20.630> mold<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:21.970> once<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.210> has<00:01:23.420> melted<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.500> hot

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
can mold this once it has melted in hot

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.040 
can mold this once it has melted in hot
water<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.350> what<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:27.710> will<00:01:27.860> be<00:01:27.920> using

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
water and this is what we will be using

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.840 
water and this is what we will be using
here<00:01:30.050> we<00:01:30.170> have<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.440> part<00:01:30.650> where<00:01:31.400> we<00:01:31.550> melt<00:01:31.790> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
here we have the part where we melt the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.940 
here we have the part where we melt the
plastic<00:01:32.619> under<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.710> low<00:01:33.890> flame<00:01:35.290> in<00:01:36.290> boiling

casserole later on this is where the
plastic<00:01:54.979> melts<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:57.610> clear<00:01:58.610> once<00:01:59.270> it's

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
plastic melts it's clear once it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.230 
plastic melts it's clear once it's
reached<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.020> right<00:02:00.229> temperature<00:02:01.240> somewhere

reached the right temperature somewhere
just

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
just

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.640

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
when they see they're not becoming to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.970 
when they see they're not becoming to
the<00:02:11.250> earth

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the earth

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
the earth
showing<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.819> lighting<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.390> truth

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
showing it's the lighting the truth

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.170 
showing it's the lighting the truth
and<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.140> take<00:02:16.410> off<00:02:16.650> what's<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> count

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and we take off what's the count

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.179 
and we take off what's the count
as<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.480> explained<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.200> first<00:02:20.439> it's<00:02:20.709> at<00:02:20.890> watching

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
as I explained it first it's at watching

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.670 
as I explained it first it's at watching
on<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> pants<00:02:21.579> so<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.629> use<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.560> that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
on the pants so you have to use and that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.569 
on the pants so you have to use and that
you<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.189> throw<00:02:24.849> away<00:02:25.379> keep<00:02:26.379> just<00:02:26.739> for<00:02:27.010> plastic

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
you can throw away keep just for plastic

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.929 
you can throw away keep just for plastic
nothing<00:02:28.379> here's<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.620> part<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.370> I've<00:02:30.549> just

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
nothing here's the part that I've just

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.509 
nothing here's the part that I've just
melted<00:02:31.629> as<00:02:32.379> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.829> it's<00:02:32.950> getting<00:02:33.189> a

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
melted as you can see it's getting a

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.819 
melted as you can see it's getting a
little<00:02:33.670> bit<00:02:33.939> white<00:02:34.780> again<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:35.590> cooling

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
little bit white again so it's cooling

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.000 
little bit white again so it's cooling
off<00:02:36.040> as<00:02:36.250> I'll<00:02:36.459> rapidly<00:02:37.000> hose<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.230> where<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.650> want

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
off as I'll rapidly hose it where I want

hasn't been seen this going white as it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.320 
hasn't been seen this going white as it
cools<00:02:53.660> off<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.730> front<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.030> flash<00:02:58.330> and
