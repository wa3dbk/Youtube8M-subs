00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
don't think any of us have looked at the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.830 
don't think any of us have looked at the
x-men<00:01:40.110> film<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.530> far<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.430> very<00:01:41.850> strict<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
x-men film so far in a very strict you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.490 
x-men film so far in a very strict you
know<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:44.159> direction<00:01:44.930> completely<00:01:45.930> linear

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
know one direction completely linear

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
know one direction completely linear
timeline<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:48.210> we've<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.509> been<00:01:48.540> willing

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
timeline I think we've all been willing

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
timeline I think we've all been willing
to<00:01:49.020> accept<00:01:49.380> some<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> continuity

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
to accept some of the continuity

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.569 
to accept some of the continuity
problems<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.829> think

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
problems and just go with it I think

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.410 
problems and just go with it I think
that's<00:01:53.700> where<00:01:53.759> they're<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> ask<00:01:54.119> us<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that's where they're going to ask us to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's where they're going to ask us to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of move forward from there and that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.870 
of move forward from there and that's
that's<00:01:58.950> probably<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> best<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.610> they<00:01:59.820> can
