everything out to where we had a cutting
and<00:00:45.300> we'll<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.719> replacing<00:00:46.350> every<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and we'll be replacing every one of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.000 
and we'll be replacing every one of
these<00:00:47.070> lines<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.820> tubes<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.469> goes<00:00:49.590> deeper

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
saturating throwing salt water

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
saturating throwing salt water
you<00:01:12.930> name<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.140> debris<00:01:13.590> under<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
undercarriage coming back and affecting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
undercarriage coming back and affecting
the<00:01:17.460> pathway<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.330> where<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.409> lines<00:01:19.650> run<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the pathway to where these lines run and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200 
the pathway to where these lines run and
you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.509> hopefully<00:01:23.030> everything<00:01:24.030> that's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you can see hopefully everything that's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
you can see hopefully everything that's
affected<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> fuel<00:01:26.549> filler

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
affected but we have the fuel filler

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
affected but we have the fuel filler
which<00:01:26.909> show<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> fuel<00:01:27.299> children<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> our<00:01:27.810> abs

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
which show the fuel children and our abs

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
which show the fuel children and our abs
and<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:29.189> brake<00:01:29.460> module<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.729> all<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and our brake module here and all the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.719 
and our brake module here and all the
rust<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:34.799> gets<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.159> underneath<00:01:35.430> these

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
rust that gets up underneath these

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
rust that gets up underneath these
things<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.390> basically<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.259> comes<00:01:37.409> down

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
things so basically what it comes down

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090 
things so basically what it comes down
to<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.130> at<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.090> end<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> every<00:01:39.900> winter<00:01:40.590> season

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to is at the end of every winter season

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.410 
to is at the end of every winter season
or<00:01:41.220> during<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> winter<00:01:41.790> season<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.180> whenever
