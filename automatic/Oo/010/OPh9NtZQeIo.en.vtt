replies to any questions that people

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.630 
replies to any questions that people
have<00:00:44.190> check<00:00:45.150> it<00:00:45.269> out<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> here's<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.250> design

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
have check it out so here's my design

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
have check it out so here's my design
it's<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.329> 66<00:00:48.989> centimeters<00:00:49.399> wide<00:00:50.399> 30

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
it's going to be 66 centimeters wide 30

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.979 
it's going to be 66 centimeters wide 30
centimeters<00:00:51.840> deep<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.290> 54<00:00:52.800> centimeters<00:00:53.040> tall

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
centimeters deep and 54 centimeters tall

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
centimeters deep and 54 centimeters tall
or<00:00:54.989> 25<00:00:55.469> inches<00:00:55.739> wide<00:00:55.800> 12<00:00:56.219> inches<00:00:56.520> deep<00:00:57.770> all

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
or 25 inches wide 12 inches deep all

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
or 25 inches wide 12 inches deep all
right<00:00:58.950> so<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> wood<00:01:00.170> two<00:01:01.170> by<00:01:01.320> four

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
right so that's the wood two by four

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.320 
right so that's the wood two by four
pieces<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.579> birch<00:01:02.940> Russian<00:01:03.420> ply<00:01:04.850> one's<00:01:05.850> eleven

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
pieces of birch Russian ply one's eleven

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.520 
pieces of birch Russian ply one's eleven
and<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> half<00:01:06.509> millimeter<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.259> other<00:01:07.380> ones

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and a half millimeter the other ones

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
and a half millimeter the other ones
eighteen<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.070> half<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.700> translates

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
eighteen and a half so that translates

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.279 
eighteen and a half so that translates
to<00:01:09.420> 1/2<00:01:10.140> inch<00:01:10.410> or<00:01:10.740> 3/4<00:01:11.550> inch<00:01:11.759> plywood<00:01:12.289> alright

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
to 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch plywood alright

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:14.359 
to 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch plywood alright
so<00:01:13.440> that's<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> difference<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so that's the difference in the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.180 
so that's the difference in the
thickness<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> wood<00:01:16.009> originally<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.070> had

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
thickness of the wood originally I had

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.249 
thickness of the wood originally I had
bought<00:01:17.340> 1/2<00:01:18.179> inch<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:18.959> concerned

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bought 1/2 inch and then I was concerned

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.300 
bought 1/2 inch and then I was concerned
that<00:01:19.410> it<00:01:19.500> wasn't<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.009> strong<00:01:20.280> enough

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that it wasn't going to be strong enough

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
that it wasn't going to be strong enough
so<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.479> went<00:01:21.660> back<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.440> piece<00:01:22.679> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so then I went back and I got a piece of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.290 
so then I went back and I got a piece of
3/4<00:01:24.979> for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.069> outside<00:01:26.459> portion<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> box

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
3/4 for the outside portion of the box

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.180 
3/4 for the outside portion of the box
then<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.810> baffle<00:01:28.350> front<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:28.800> are<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.099> to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
then the baffle front back are going to

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:54.040 
then the baffle front back are going to
be<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.459> 1/2<00:01:29.640> inch

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.290 

all<00:01:54.860> right<00:01:54.980> so<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.370> ends<00:01:55.580> are<00:01:55.670> cut<00:01:55.820> now

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
all right so all the ends are cut now

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.240 
all right so all the ends are cut now
we're<00:01:56.480> going<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.650> we're<00:01:57.650> going<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.830> create<00:01:57.980> box

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
we're going to we're going to create box

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:28.259 
we're going to we're going to create box
joints<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:58.940> get<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.630> all<00:01:59.750> glued<00:02:00.020> together

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.000 

the<00:02:29.269> box<00:02:29.480> joints<00:02:29.870> are<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.080> made<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.799> ended<00:02:30.980> up

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the box joints are all made we ended up

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.610 
the box joints are all made we ended up
making<00:02:31.159> them<00:02:31.430> 3/4<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.440> bit

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
making them 3/4 because that's the bit

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.160 
making them 3/4 because that's the bit
that<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.980> had<00:02:34.159> so<00:02:35.090> there's<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.659> few<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:35.989> than

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that we had so there's a few more than

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.580 
that we had so there's a few more than
maybe<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.980> should<00:02:37.190> had<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.260> think<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.379> ready

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
maybe we should had but I think is ready

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.589 
maybe we should had but I think is ready
to<00:02:39.709> get<00:02:40.099> glued<00:02:40.370> down<00:02:40.579> there<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.269> bit<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
to get glued down there was a bit of

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.899 
to get glued down there was a bit of
filing<00:02:41.780> involved<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.500> course<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.790> going

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
filing involved of course but it's going

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.220 
filing involved of course but it's going
to<00:02:43.970> work<00:02:45.340> careful<00:02:46.340> pal<00:02:46.549> all<00:02:47.090> right<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to work careful pal all right so the the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.740 
to work careful pal all right so the the
supports<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.849> all<00:02:50.030> square<00:02:50.510> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
supports are on it it's all square and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.880 
supports are on it it's all square and
we're<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.049> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> wait<00:02:51.409> for<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.650> glue<00:02:51.860> to

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
we're just going to wait for the glue to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.910 
we're just going to wait for the glue to
dry<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.629> we're<00:02:53.629> going<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.780> cut<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> front<00:02:54.769> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
dry and we're going to cut the front and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:17.330 
dry and we're going to cut the front and
back<00:02:55.040> baffles<00:02:55.489> maybe

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.089 

just<00:03:18.340> getting<00:03:18.640> ready<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:19.090> put<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.569> the

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
just getting ready to put the the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.650 
just getting ready to put the the
spacers<00:03:21.099> on<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> front<00:03:21.730> there<00:03:22.390> was<00:03:22.480> some

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
spacers on the front there was some

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.229 
spacers on the front there was some
debate<00:03:22.959> whether<00:03:23.709> or<00:03:23.830> not<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.700> actually<00:03:25.030> needed

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
debate whether or not we actually needed

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.610 
debate whether or not we actually needed
the<00:03:25.420> spacers<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:26.080> or<00:03:26.380> off<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:28.200> after<00:03:29.200> some

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the spacers on or off and after some

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.640 
the spacers on or off and after some
searching<00:03:29.890> around<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:31.319> decided<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.560> was

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
searching around I decided that I was

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.990 
searching around I decided that I was
going<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.800> put<00:03:33.010> some<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:35.110> consensus<00:03:35.739> is

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
going to put some on the consensus is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.729 
going to put some on the consensus is
maybe<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.720> might<00:03:37.900> need<00:03:38.080> them<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.349> might<00:03:38.530> not

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
maybe you might need them you might not

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.660 
maybe you might need them you might not
I<00:03:39.840> guess<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> general<00:03:41.110> idea<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.620> if<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.190> grill

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
I guess the general idea is if the grill

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.640 
I guess the general idea is if the grill
cloth<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.150> too<00:03:43.330> flat<00:03:43.660> then<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.380> might<00:03:44.530> get

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
cloth is too flat then you might get

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.380 
cloth is too flat then you might get
some<00:03:44.890> flapping<00:03:45.400> depending<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:45.970> airflow

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
some flapping depending on the airflow

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.750 
some flapping depending on the airflow
coming<00:03:46.569> out<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.870> your<00:03:46.959> speakers<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.640> if<00:03:48.640> you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
coming out of your speakers and if you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.220 
coming out of your speakers and if you
stand<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.209> off<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.360> bit<00:03:49.690> that's<00:03:49.930> supposed<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
stand it off a bit that's supposed to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.000 
stand it off a bit that's supposed to
eliminate<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
eliminate it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.920 
eliminate it
so<00:03:51.280> since<00:03:51.819> we're<00:03:52.030> doing<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.450> from<00:03:52.600> fresh

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
so since we're doing this from fresh

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.920 
so since we're doing this from fresh
that's<00:03:53.590> what<00:03:53.769> I'm<00:03:53.860> going<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.040> do<00:03:54.540> glue<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.720> on

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
that's what I'm going to do glue that on

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:13.510 
that's what I'm going to do glue that on
and<00:03:56.860> then<00:03:56.890> we're<00:03:57.160> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.310> spray<00:03:57.549> it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:52.230 

you

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.960 

we're<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.360> going<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.570> glue<00:04:53.690> in<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.080> back

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
we're just going to glue in the back

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.310 
we're just going to glue in the back
supports<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> baffle

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:20.149 

since<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:01.010> get<00:05:01.220> some

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.339 

so<00:05:20.699> I've<00:05:20.819> already<00:05:20.969> marked<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.449> out<00:05:21.569> how<00:05:22.139> far

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
so I've already marked it out how far

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.169 
so I've already marked it out how far
the<00:05:22.529> depth<00:05:22.739> is<00:05:22.919> for<00:05:23.129> the<00:05:23.219> back<00:05:23.399> we're<00:05:24.149> leaving

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:24.179 
the depth is for the back we're leaving

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:27.499 
the depth is for the back we're leaving
a<00:05:24.479> small<00:05:24.749> space<00:05:25.110> there<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:25.619> I<00:05:25.679> can<00:05:25.919> tip<00:05:26.159> in<00:05:26.509> the

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
a small space there so I can tip in the

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.179 
a small space there so I can tip in the
front<00:05:28.020> where<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.289> speakers<00:05:28.679> are<00:05:28.830> going<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:29.069> go

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
front where the speakers are going to go

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.979 
front where the speakers are going to go
and<00:05:29.519> then<00:05:29.759> we're<00:05:29.909> going<00:05:30.059> to<00:05:30.119> lay<00:05:30.509> out<00:05:30.629> from<00:05:30.869> the

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:30.989 
and then we're going to lay out from the

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:42.110 
and then we're going to lay out from the
side<00:05:31.199> to<00:05:31.499> keep<00:05:31.679> it<00:05:31.860> secure

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.420 

so<00:05:43.120> here's<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.420> front<00:05:43.630> speaker<00:05:44.110> baffle<00:05:44.590> it's

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
so here's the front speaker baffle it's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.420 
so here's the front speaker baffle it's
ready<00:05:45.700> to<00:05:46.000> spray<00:05:46.630> paint<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:47.230> just<00:05:47.710> knocked<00:05:48.130> into

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
ready to spray paint I just knocked into

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.930 
ready to spray paint I just knocked into
T<00:05:49.620> T<00:05:50.620> nuts<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:53.130> then<00:05:54.130> I'm<00:05:54.430> going<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.640> cut<00:05:54.850> it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
T T nuts and then I'm going to cut it

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.370 
T T nuts and then I'm going to cut it
back<00:05:55.390> baffle<00:05:58.110> my<00:05:59.110> basic<00:05:59.470> design<00:06:00.900> pull<00:06:01.900> oval<00:06:02.290> on

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
back baffle my basic design pull oval on

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.510 
back baffle my basic design pull oval on
the<00:06:02.500> back<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:02.650> saw<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.070> on<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.220> internet

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
the back I saw it on the internet

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.010 
the back I saw it on the internet
somewhere<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:04.000> couple<00:06:04.480> people<00:06:04.600> had<00:06:04.840> that

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
somewhere a couple people had that

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.180 
somewhere a couple people had that
design<00:06:05.320> and<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.680> thought<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:05.920> was<00:06:06.010> pretty

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
design and I thought it was pretty

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.390 
design and I thought it was pretty
awesome<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:07.870> I'm<00:06:08.110> going<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.320> get<00:06:09.190> started

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
awesome so I'm going to get started

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.450 
awesome so I'm going to get started
cutting<00:06:09.760> that<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.860> then<00:06:11.860> after<00:06:12.100> that<00:06:12.340> I'm

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
cutting that and then after that I'm

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:28.670 
cutting that and then after that I'm
going<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.670> give<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.820> a<00:06:12.850> spray

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.420 

okay<00:06:29.680> fellas<00:06:30.070> so<00:06:30.280> here's<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:30.670> final<00:06:30.880> box<00:06:32.430> just

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
okay fellas so here's the final box just

give them a quick Sandover it's pretty
much<00:06:36.640> finished<00:06:38.400> baffles<00:06:39.400> are<00:06:39.550> ready<00:06:39.760> to<00:06:39.880> go

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
much finished baffles are ready to go

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.220 
much finished baffles are ready to go
I'm<00:06:40.180> going<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.390> spray<00:06:40.600> paint<00:06:40.870> everything

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
I'm going to spray paint everything

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.520 
I'm going to spray paint everything
today<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:42.760> only<00:06:43.000> significant<00:06:43.720> problem<00:06:44.410> that

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
today the only significant problem that

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.030 
today the only significant problem that
I<00:06:44.590> really<00:06:44.950> ran<00:06:45.190> into<00:06:45.640> was<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:46.360> corners<00:06:47.040> which

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
I really ran into was the corners which

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.900 
I really ran into was the corners which
will<00:06:48.280> not<00:06:48.460> make<00:06:48.640> a<00:06:48.670> difference<00:06:49.090> at<00:06:49.240> all<00:06:50.910> you

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
will not make a difference at all you

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.450 
will not make a difference at all you
can<00:06:52.120> see<00:06:52.390> that<00:06:52.630> I<00:06:52.900> didn't<00:06:53.890> run<00:06:54.040> it<00:06:54.160> through<00:06:54.310> the

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
can see that I didn't run it through the

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.820 
can see that I didn't run it through the
router<00:06:54.670> very<00:06:55.030> well<00:06:55.300> so<00:06:55.780> they're<00:06:55.960> a<00:06:55.990> bit<00:06:56.110> shy

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
router very well so they're a bit shy

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.620 
router very well so they're a bit shy
when<00:06:56.860> I<00:06:57.190> pieced<00:06:57.550> it<00:06:57.670> together<00:06:57.820> so<00:06:58.300> we<00:06:58.330> had<00:06:58.540> to

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
when I pieced it together so we had to

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.490 
when I pieced it together so we had to
put<00:06:58.780> some<00:06:58.960> wood<00:06:59.800> filler<00:07:00.070> in<00:07:00.340> there<00:07:01.230> not<00:07:02.230> really

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
put some wood filler in there not really

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.640 
decide what I'm going to do with the
handles<00:07:12.970> I<00:07:14.520> ordered<00:07:15.520> some<00:07:15.670> round<00:07:15.910> ones<00:07:16.650> I'm

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
handles I ordered some round ones I'm

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.590 
handles I ordered some round ones I'm
not<00:07:17.830> sure<00:07:18.040> I<00:07:18.070> really<00:07:18.400> care<00:07:18.610> for<00:07:18.640> them<00:07:19.090> so<00:07:19.300> are

not sure I really care for them so are
some<00:07:19.930> other<00:07:20.110> ones<00:07:20.290> I'm<00:07:20.620> just<00:07:20.770> waiting<00:07:21.070> for

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
some other ones I'm just waiting for

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.370 
some other ones I'm just waiting for
those<00:07:21.340> to<00:07:21.490> come<00:07:21.670> in<00:07:21.820> and<00:07:22.570> then<00:07:22.930> I'll<00:07:23.050> cut<00:07:23.230> the

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
those to come in and then I'll cut the

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.950 
those to come in and then I'll cut the
sides<00:07:23.620> for<00:07:23.950> the<00:07:24.040> handles<00:07:24.690> it's<00:07:25.690> going<00:07:25.840> to<00:07:25.900> be

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
sides for the handles it's going to be

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.600 
sides for the handles it's going to be
way<00:07:26.080> too<00:07:26.110> heavy<00:07:26.440> to<00:07:26.590> carry<00:07:26.620> around<00:07:26.980> without

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
way too heavy to carry around without

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.150 
way too heavy to carry around without
handles<00:07:28.030> on<00:07:28.150> obviously<00:07:28.420> and<00:07:29.050> I<00:07:29.140> really<00:07:29.980> care

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
handles on obviously and I really care

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.280 
handles on obviously and I really care
for<00:07:30.220> those<00:07:30.520> top<00:07:30.790> straps<00:07:31.240> I<00:07:31.570> think<00:07:32.020> that's<00:07:32.170> a

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290 
for those top straps I think that's a

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.160 
for those top straps I think that's a
bit<00:07:32.440> much<00:07:32.470> for<00:07:32.650> a<00:07:32.920> 2<00:07:33.100> by<00:07:33.250> 12<00:07:33.580> so<00:07:34.020> all<00:07:35.020> right

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170 
bit much for a 2 by 12 so all right

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.750 
bit much for a 2 by 12 so all right
