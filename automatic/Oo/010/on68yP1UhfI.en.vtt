 from america did not like athletics 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.400

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.439
 university then resorted to 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.209
 american when the sementera mind does not 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.410
 bought an xbox game called teachers 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.870

 in January it's just another game 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.019
 playing a damn video game that is if

 not really so thanks to this data 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.970
 we have the question of today if 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.860
 could have the ability of any 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.380
 character of a video game or movie or 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.000

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.500
 you want your comment to appear in the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.269
 next video who second be there 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.280
 down in the comments the question that 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.290
 already tells you I suggest my saying with the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.600
 that you also follow on twitter @ song the 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.670

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.530
 you dance a little bit with this 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.230
 dance of the rain because apparently it was 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.080
 effective as it is people of us is 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.689
 we have here before us power 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.720
 a lot to have an idea 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.230
 there are casualties 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.230
