00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
you think I look around why'd you put it

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.129 
you think I look around why'd you put it
in<00:04:06.920> well<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.310> put<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:08.019> horizontal<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:09.109> the

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
in well you put it horizontal in the

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.140 
in well you put it horizontal in the
sink<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:09.680> if<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.859> shoots<00:04:10.130> off<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.579> will<00:04:10.819> well

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
sink so if it shoots off it will well

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.930 
sink so if it shoots off it will well
just<00:04:11.599> it's<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.870> fight<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.260> sangre<00:04:12.940> all
