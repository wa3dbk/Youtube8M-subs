00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.220
 so what now comes from the mep uplink 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.210
 so collects 2 collects in 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.369
 black Ops 2 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 Okay, we'll take that over here 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 storm rifle so then I'm curious 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.570
 Well here I am all right 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:49.270
 I'll show you a little bit of that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:57.760
 mep looks like it just looks like 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:01:02.559
 stop without snow my goodness is similar 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:06.729
 the partly about bad man real 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.859
 Bad and there I still had to 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.209
 go 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.319
 who with his mp 7 could i 

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:13.259
 finally some again 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:17.670
 I have not used them for a long time 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.670
 So that does not look very nice 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.770
 well come show me okay there I walk 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770
 continue 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.690
 oh what a bit here sees the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.400
 actually pretty good so it's visually 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.700
 actually very successful with the light 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.080
 and I like that like that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.440
 even otherwise partially does not even look 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.300
 not so good off so this middle area 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.409
 which bothers me a bit 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.509
 this map is just following and indeed 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.110
 from the colors like it stops 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.610
 how to be characters and stuff like that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 that's just how it is so that you are the opponents 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.380
 can often recognize very poorly 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.890
 we do wait a degree shocks pig 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890
 thrown 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.660
 Come on, I can get you off 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.590
 not in here what is that lay that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.590
 really can not be 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.280
 that can not be him 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.510
 suddenly there is 1 1 over 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.959
 can jump and you can not 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.090
 catch 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.660
 already crass somewhere like said the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.069
 scores I do not care that itchy me 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.930
 Now a shit because as I said 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.519
 You probably only have it right now 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:02.190
 these good players online and I moved 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.390
 the game is not so regular now 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.860
 just goes even about that they have a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.920
 a little something here again from the mep 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.209
 look good to the app you need otherwise 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.160
 do not say much that everybody knows 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.459
 just looks a bit different like that 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.700
 we can do this here 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.700
 I give birth 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.660
 how fast that will happen again 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.450
 my head out on me like me 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.340
 is it 85? 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.640
 well, no castor he comes again 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.640
 one 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.720
 was partly actually looks now 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.840
 visually, that is not really the case 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.050
 bad I do not have to say it that way 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 evil 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.650
 where is the type 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.920
 where is the guy who stays then too 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.920
 lie 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:22.010
 both the scratching times werewolf 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 above one more 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.650
 or he comes now here come 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.350
 now here are emails okay we will 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.000
 move us a bit again 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.000
 they 're all sure to mold up there 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.690
 then only the ones coming here are watching 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.479
 no here they are but who thinks one 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:56.690
 kill made us fucked up we were there 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:56.690
 a car is sitting there, come here 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.840
 yep you can still make a mushroom we 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.229
 have the control without yes ever 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.500
 not wrong and now we try 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.860
 flank them here again and there 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.260
 came the next shame shame shame 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.729
 but at least we lead them to 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.580
 software actually win the budget 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.030
 can not not bad about not over 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.169
 you bad 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:35.270
 they're on this one again 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:35.270
 building caught in it 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:43.050
 We'll walk here again ok 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.860
 so the lmg pity just fine 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.030
 gone there are now a few more 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.750
 I have to watch that we do not, the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:57.180
 now behind me 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:59.870
 no is not the case he probably from the house 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.870
 path 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.930
 but let us lead that we win 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:15.280
 yes it out now that are well here 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.360
 in this gang and now cool thing 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 but I just caught a pity 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.830
 okay that was a round here 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.880
 collects what have we score 16 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.230
 70 is not so bad 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.200
 that's not so bad 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.990
 I was one of the best 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.950
 from the kg even the best but good because 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.580
 it does not play good gameplay or ok 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.580
 pure and
