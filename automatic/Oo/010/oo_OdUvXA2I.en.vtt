00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.020
 hello such a welcome to your program 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.760
 creative woman I'm measuring ramirez and 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.279
 Well today I have you ready 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.080
 a renewal program because the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.029
 good innovation let's grab that 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.990
 those things that you have at home and that already 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.150
 they look medium 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.829
 worn out so they need to be 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.540
 renew, yes, give them one more touch 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.700
 good female, we are going to renew them 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.310
 today we are going to start with a 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.739
 candle you obviously need a candle 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.870
 as long as I have here paper of 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.989
 Chinese it does not matter if it is wrinkled 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.450
 liquid glue your scissors your brush 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.880
 ink and a stamp the ink and stamp 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.220
 can do optional what are we going to do 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.560
 this candle that you already see here simple and 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.540
 simple that does not have good that is already a 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.430
 little bit worn we are going to give it a touch 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.220
 to make it look much prettier 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.439
 we started cutting our paper of 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.880
 important china very important that 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.570
 they have been forgetting we are going to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.229
 measure the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.729
 to be sure that it reaches us there 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.840
 is and more or less around here we are going to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.130
 trim 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.530
 materials that I know good you have in 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.290
 house that do not occupy that not occupied 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.100
 spend the china paper we can give 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.479
 many uses no matter what 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.640
 arrugadito and others because in this 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.220
 technique that already on some other occasion you 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.920
 present that we call decoupage if you 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.050
 you agree this technique is good not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.570
 matter that the paper this as well as 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.509
 wrinkled and others I'm trying to 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.759
 measure it so that we do not overdo anything not the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.640
 let's line like that directly right now 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:56.259
 I 'll explain how we cut it look 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 nothing more than fit I had the exact no 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.220
 worry these candles last a long time 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.800
 if you're thinking hey but he's going to take 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.890
 the paper do not worry they last a lot 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.570
 a lot of time and as it happens 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 this lowering the good candle you rise and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.269
 from there tearing a piece of paper 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.880
 there is let me remove it a short 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.860
 again and here on this side I 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.900
 I have diamond glue with 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.970
 diamond that is very very easy to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.739
 find also I think that already of 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.420
 see it you will know where where is it what 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.099
 you can find and what 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.790
 let's do is put a little bit of 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.360
 very little gum very little and with your 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.310
 Brush 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.860
 you are going to give him a little 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 a little bit of movement so that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.030
 extend we put the important role 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.270
 important to put a little and then over 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 of that to go putting more you set 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.360
 in this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.540
 we put a little in the base again 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.820
 9 we said that this good technique will 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.670
 we call of cups you can practice 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.300
 on a table or on a table 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.800
 infinity infinity center here look what 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.930
 only thing that you have to take care of is that 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.670
 It is very very wrinkled even if you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.250
 like the place good milestone you can leave it 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.350
 well I'm putting another one on very light 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 because right now I'm going to give you the finished 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.580
 with the other bomb that I have that the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 adif or if we put rubber we extend it 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.810
 as much as possible 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.830
 we stretch it super super well it's not going to 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.000
 notice the union do not worry if it is left 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.070
 and you do not notice 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.980
 and since we have it that way totally 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.930
 then we are going to put the one that shines 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.930
 and I remove nothing more 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.960
 and it was finished wetting our 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.600
 paper 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.310
 if you do not find the village candle that 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.950
 you want if you do not keep the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.080
 combination of your good house this is a 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.810
 great idea so that all the candles 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.750
 Put the same color you can even 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
 put you from similar colors very very 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.490
 simple 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.040
 and she is staying 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.350
 if we are going to put a little bit more today 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.020
 we are very very late everything we are 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.150
 making purple to see we give this 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.980
 side again 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.550
 you can give one or two tapas very very 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.550
 simple 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.470
 to this one 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.240
 in the bottom part you also put a 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.310
 little bit or when I know you can cut 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 all that surplus 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.380
 who facilitated your landlines we already have a 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.480
 candle almost finished you have to leave it 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.170
 dry give it two capes to be 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.420
 completely look at how it is being 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.430
 you can put little squares of colors 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.730
 Only one color can you put 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.070
 good there you to you with your taste that you 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.900
 stay with the decoration of your house and 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.520
 that we have it completely dry 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.510
 obviously you have to let it dry 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.880
 you can put it in black ink 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.010
 some design or with a stamp too 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.410
 based on a stamp printed on the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.810
 part of good the opposite and 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.790
 it's dry, not like that, look, I'm going to put 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.010
 one only because everything is wet and 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.440
 maybe there you get to see maybe not 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.900
 he grabs it very well we're going to leave him 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.090
 to dry and dry completely 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.650
 well then it will be very 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.830
 so you can set a bar 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.410
 in this way and the complete measure 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.630
 also that it's the right size look 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.419
 now adheres because it has rubber what 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.270
 ideal is that you wait for it to dry and 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.979
 that dries well then you put this 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.660
 lath quoted I'm doing it like that 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.350
 very fast because I want you to see the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.060
 complete idea very very simple 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.060
 I even want you to put it on 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.870
 better at a party if you're going to have 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.850
 some wedding a christening this is a great 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.889
 idea to decorate a candle that good not 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.680
 you have it as well as how simple you 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.780
 fixed how easy they are there already what 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.820
 We renew and other candle is already 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.380
 see more presentable in the part of 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.139
 opposite you can complement with a 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.660
 little you can leave it like that, you give it there 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.100
 the touch that you think looks better 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.020
 important here is that you use your 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.880
 imagination and good that you use 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.460
 materials that you already have in a house 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.729
 very simple way, I 'm going to finish it 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.889
 to put here a little more d 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.319
 I have it looks at me and it's there staying 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.389
 I do not know if you can see it in the house 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.699
 but if you put it a little side there 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.490
 you see the gleams of the rubber that 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.439
 use it calmly let it 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.419
 dry I did a little good 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.789
 quick so you can see the technique 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.650
 Completely finished but what materials 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.809
 we use very simple materials 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.120
 We take Chinese paper I will put them 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.009
 around here we use this rubber that I know 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.379
 that you will find very very easily 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.020
 you already have diamond you find it in 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:54.779
 any place of fabrics we occupy a 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.729
 little bit of white glue a brush 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.889
 Chinese paper that does not matter if it is 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:02.139
 wrinkled and look how cute you look 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.490
 there is 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.460
 important nothing else I let it dry 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.960
 give him about 3 capita with you with your 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.030
 diamond with your glue 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.910
 diamond and good have a lot 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.040
 patience and create something nice of what already 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.510
 you have at home you do not need to spend much 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.310
 so I'm going to invite you to go 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.230
 some commercials because right now 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.210
 let's go back I'll teach you how to make a 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.690
 box with a wooden board we return 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.690
 in a little while 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.260
