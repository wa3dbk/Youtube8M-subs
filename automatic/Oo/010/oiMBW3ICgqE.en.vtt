 guys i 'm here in the gloomy garden 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 in the mission review on this here is the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 last mission of history where people 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.830
 face the minds nec has that god 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.199
 vex sides and have a neighbor easter egg 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.090
 here I had seen 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.860
 only I had not associated what 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 happens as esther and luti I adore team 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.899
 even greener 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 I discovered it from here when I was 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 searching the videos of the nine 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 unintentionally I saw the official image leaves 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 I see if it really is people 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.510
 just draw easter egg 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 so the seekers understood me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.180
 how I really like to read about 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 on the planets the stars 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.960
 constellations these things 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.500
 Look how cool we're going to finish killing. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.500
 the doll here a fee to the dolls 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.670
 End up here, people are where 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.630
 appears with flow there we will activate 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 it will activate that expires it will open 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.119
 This door is this portal here for us. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.240
 give one in fact there is no one to carry 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 A door is for us to face the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.400
 mind when you achieve it here. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 People already played are on top. 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.040
 appears a door to door it divides 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.040
 into pieces right crowd 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 if you pay attention to the position of the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.479
 pieces of the door she forms a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.969
 Image is very interesting, you go. 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 see that I 'm going to use the video right away 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.149
 you have the right spot it is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.689
 undo where you need to connect the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.030
 points 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.250
 Look how nice she'll activate me there. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.500
 I'll stay here a little further back 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.450
 then I almost fall 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:26.350
 a second so stay watching it goes 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:30.040
 the door appears there there is the door there 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:37.600
 that door it divides the symbol that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:40.840
 she's going to graduate eating is this symbol 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.650
 that this symbol is an easter egg let's 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 Land the galera here and get only those 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.430
 points here you are seeing that you have 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 pieces seemingly looking at you like this 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.990
 You're going to understand nothing, then I 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.860
 I put some red dots to 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.980
 Do you understand that seeing this? 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.410
 something clearer for you, me too 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.090
 I think not 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.500
 so we can connect the most points 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.880
 We have to connect the points of the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.720
 right places 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.210
 so the galera that from here maybe you 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.190
 do not know maybe you do not even know who 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.120
 will also know that talking is your father and 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.490
 your mother 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.590
 If you look up in the sky, you will. 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.290
 see this formation of the stars 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.260
 The one you see here is the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.750
 constellation of órion 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.620
 there in the middle there in the middle of the portal where 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.500
 have those 33 points nearest one of the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.200
 another is is what is commonly known 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 like the three marias so you can ask 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.400
 your father your mother they will know that 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.530
 What stars are and will you achieve? 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.320
 find them in the sky and you will get 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.070
 see this constellation from here where we 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.650
 Yes we are. I was addicted to seeing the 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.300
 respect for the stars and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.680
 constellation of órion 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.090
 This training is here, this is it. 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.670
 to think to search the galley in mythology 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.130
 Greek 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.100
 Ionon, how interesting was a 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:21.030
 hunter a hunter he faced is 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.550
 enemies much larger than him 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.680
 something else is a coincidence 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.699
 it would be like that 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 is very much to the constellation of oil 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.610
 visibly speaking visibly 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.870
 speaking is very close to Venus and that 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.009
 It's the planet where we are. 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.370
 and if it's a very easter egg 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.430
 interesting 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.190
 if you know any more of a stereotype 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.590
 put in the very comments there 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.389
 interesting then worth seeing 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.410
 story of the man he was defeated 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.949
 then a scorpion says mythology 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.520
 that he was killed is by a scorpion 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:09.400
 giant but orion faced was a 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.340
 hunter facing tusks let's say 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.139
 so bigger than the guys I hope 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.789
 Did you like this easter? 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.680
