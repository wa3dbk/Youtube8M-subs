00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
I don't know why but the designs kind of
looked<00:01:19.259> familiar<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.979> pokemon<00:01:20.759> black<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
looked familiar to pokemon black and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
looked familiar to pokemon black and
white<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> Pokemon<00:01:23.009> designs<00:01:23.340> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
white like not the Pokemon designs but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
white like not the Pokemon designs but
the<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> looks<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.140> enhanced

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the way it looks but it's more enhanced

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
the way it looks but it's more enhanced
so<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> completely<00:01:27.420> changed<00:01:27.810> like

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I mentioned before so that's really

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
I mentioned before so that's really
great<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.530> managed

Ember

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
Ember

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.420 
Ember
cuz<00:03:18.720> fennekin<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.590> probably<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.010> low<00:03:20.220> level

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
cuz fennekin is probably a low level

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.900 
cuz fennekin is probably a low level
level<00:03:21.180> 5<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:22.260> somewhere<00:03:23.099> around<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.790> I'm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
level 5 or somewhere around there so I'm

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.729 
level 5 or somewhere around there so I'm
pretty<00:03:24.359> sure<00:03:24.599> that's<00:03:24.720> not<00:03:24.840> flamethrower<00:03:25.500> but

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
pretty sure that's not flamethrower but

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.229 
pretty sure that's not flamethrower but
if<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.190> flamethrower<00:03:26.669> okay

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
if it is flamethrower okay
