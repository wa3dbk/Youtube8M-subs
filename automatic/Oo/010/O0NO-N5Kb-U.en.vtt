 You can do the oil and the milk and the salt 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:50.160

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.060

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:09.090
 I 've got the building there just came today 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.640
 I make my team times pizza weather 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.260
 just roll out the pasta 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.650
 I'm not going to open Peter right now 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 occupy my worktop because that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.350
 Can I do so badly then? 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.019
 I still have a pizza stone 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.269
 But you can also just a plate 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.549
 to take 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.220
 I 'll just save help now 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.400
 with flour sprinkled the pizza stand 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.660
 I use it even when I'm in the oven again 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.540
 then make or make bread 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.879
 it tastes very different 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.569
 Now sheep's cheese comes in the 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.569
 matter 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.830
 and the pages I will then 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.830
 simply make it work 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.080
 Pizza oven or pizza maker if you want that 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.460
 also call does 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.490
 I really do a lot of bar I do that 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.980
 Now do not let it be yours 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.810
 animals since I bake a lot of it is 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 that unfortunately can not be avoided that way 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.170
 will dare 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:30.270
 so now I 'll be easy again 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.270
 give up and do 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.780
 The build takes about four to five minutes 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.919
 no longer do is peter thinks ready 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.919
 now comes 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.280
 me with garlic you can of course 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.430
 also more garlic which needs love 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.250
 if he likes that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.470
 So we have to come back so then 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.670
 the cheese is on it 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.840
 the pages will be easy to do 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:17.730
 so not too fat easy 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.730
 to crack the patient 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.640
 so on is already finished now 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.640
 coming 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.039
 So that's really very important 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:41.439
 that you stone with this buffer 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.689
 otherwise you can not do that 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.229
 you will leave that is all in the 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.689
 path 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.969
 that's why you do not need any 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.369
 to think about something new 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:54.129
 bought that looks exactly like that but 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:56.799
 again use the brand is 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.289
 not because it is cold can 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:03.519
 Just do it with a dry one 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:07.019
 rags away so harmless 

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:09.999
 now my gown with me 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:12.219
 supercross still out and by the way 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.319
 tastes in here also lammert the 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.499
 Turkish fitz was really delicious 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.719
 as if yours is getting out there first 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.679
 nothing tastes any different 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.379
 outside 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:26.529
 you want you can watch the pages with a 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.419
 a little bit of butter spread over it 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.249
 soft 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.249
 He also thinks that way 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.100
 so are my best with sheep's cheese 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.930
 filling and then it is at 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.930

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.009
 that's her on the stones for pizza 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.340
 or stone oven to malta and picture 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.599

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.060
 do 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.009
 I'll show you how you are 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.970
 could do the same thing in the oven to 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:14.800
 because it will be needed 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.319
 get so everywhere I had my 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.419
 I think I can get it right 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.370
 I can change with these bought knows 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.880

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:27.159
 Amazon ordered then looks like me 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.470

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.330
 long breath turkish fans be because 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:57.430
