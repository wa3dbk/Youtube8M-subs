00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
knew are gonna be the heroes because it

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.990 
knew are gonna be the heroes because it
was<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> hero<00:04:30.020> within<00:04:30.919> all<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.250> us<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.910> that

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
was the hero within all of us and that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.810 
was the hero within all of us and that
basic<00:04:32.600> idea<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.139> good<00:04:33.350> versus<00:04:33.680> evil<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.400> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
basic idea of good versus evil in the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.340 
basic idea of good versus evil in the
most<00:04:35.030> simplest<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.540> ways<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.169> most

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
most simplest of ways and on the most

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.409 
most simplest of ways and on the most
grand<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.830> scales<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.729> I<00:04:37.970> think<00:04:38.180> that's<00:04:38.300> why

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
grand of scales and I think that's why

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.050 
grand of scales and I think that's why
the<00:04:38.479> book<00:04:38.720> has<00:04:38.930> remained<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.889> de<00:04:40.490> popular<00:04:40.880> book

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
the book has remained a de popular book

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.790 
the book has remained a de popular book
over<00:04:41.419> time<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> mean<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.050> think<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.350> 60s

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
over time I mean I think the 60s

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.010 
over time I mean I think the 60s
obviously<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.910> was<00:04:44.030> being<00:04:44.300> mirrored<00:04:44.750> against

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
obviously it was being mirrored against

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.570 
obviously it was being mirrored against
Vietnam<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.770> all<00:04:45.830> those<00:04:46.040> kind<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.280> things<00:04:46.490> so

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
Vietnam and all those kind of things so

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:55.810 
Vietnam and all those kind of things so
the<00:04:47.000> hippies<00:04:47.270> really<00:04:47.479> took<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.720> dog<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:55.669> it's

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
the hippies really took a dog and it's

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.780 
the hippies really took a dog and it's
worth<00:04:59.410> perhaps<00:05:00.410> one<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.100> secrets<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.669> the

success<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.330> these<00:05:02.510> films<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.530> they

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
success of these films is that they

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.740 
success of these films is that they
