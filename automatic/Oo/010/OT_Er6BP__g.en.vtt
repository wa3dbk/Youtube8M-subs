00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in uberlândia the medical service 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.370
 started with the nuclear 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
 nuclear medicine 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.230
 some 15 years ago this center is the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540
 nuclear medicine service 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.509
 ours was located in the holy hospital 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 genove and until today is where our 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.730
 unit 1 in santa genoveva hospital 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 after some time around 2002 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.369
 nuclear medicine has been expanded to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.300
 second unit that on that occasion 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.150
 I was in front of the holy hospital 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 catarina in rua vieira gonçalves and the year 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.739
 we made the change in the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.270
 location of this unit 2 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 we deactivated the scallop unit 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 gonçalves and we have prepared a new service 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.100
 to allocate it as our second unit 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.410
 this is where we are now this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.719
 unit 2 is the second unit of the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 Triangle nuclear medicine this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.440
 unit was dedicated to cardiology 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 on this unit we run from Monday 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 the Friday the whole time exams 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.199
 cardiology, more specifically the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.250
 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.220
 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy it 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 is popularly known as mib o mib 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 or myocardial perfusion scintigraphy 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 is an examination is dedicated to identify the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.450
 risk that a patient has to have a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.380
 infarction or a sudden death problem 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.270
 cardiological 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.880
 basically that's what it felt spelling 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.500
 It makes it so diagnosis diagnosed 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.049
 who is at risk of a heart attack 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.579
 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.619
 in the case of the patient who has had a 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.900
 infarction or that patient who has already 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.420
 an angioplasty that has already placed a stent 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 has already done some saphenous and mammary 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.170
 this patient he benefits from be 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.970
 because the mpe can predict this patient 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.060
 what risk does he experience from a 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 new event or new infarction or to come 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 need another 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 procedure then this unit to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.700
 unit 2 is dedicated to cardiology and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
 unit 1 now has more freedom 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 with more free time to devote 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
 general nuclear medicine then all 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.090
 other nuclear medicine exams are 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 performed in unit 1 that is located 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.180
 in the hospital santa genoveva that others 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.150
 exams bone scans thyroid tests 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.390
 laugh 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.680
 lung examination of stomach 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.780
 cerebral scintigraphy anyway 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 other evaluation that may be 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.280
 needed in nuclear medicine 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.849
 she is besieged is headquartered in Unit 1 in 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.849
 santa genoveva hospital
