you know what scrub too hard because it
eventually<00:02:13.980> will<00:02:14.220> take<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.600> writing<00:02:16.020> off

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
eventually will take the the writing off

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.710 
eventually will take the the writing off
so<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> don't<00:02:17.370> want<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.850> too<00:02:18.120> too<00:02:18.540> much

cap<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.769> by<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> control<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.670> there's<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
cap here by the control here there's a

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.320 
cap here by the control here there's a
little<00:03:21.269> spot<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:22.070> juice<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.550> board<00:03:23.820> that's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
little spot of juice on the board that's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.420 
little spot of juice on the board that's
the<00:03:24.540> electrolyte<00:03:25.170> inside<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> capacitors

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the electrolyte inside the capacitors

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.580 
the electrolyte inside the capacitors
oozing<00:03:26.910> out<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.989> eventually<00:03:28.230> does

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
oozing out and what it eventually does

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.199 
oozing out and what it eventually does
is<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.890> eats<00:03:29.160> right<00:03:29.519> through<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.970> plate

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
is it eats right through the plate

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.580 
is it eats right through the plate
through<00:03:30.480> holes<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.989> though<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:31.410> call

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590

some<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.110> these<00:03:49.170> I'm<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.590> sure<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.830> think<00:03:50.070> this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
some of these I'm not sure I think this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.880 
some of these I'm not sure I think this
is<00:03:50.370> actually<00:03:50.810> animals<00:03:51.810> double<00:03:52.320> plated<00:03:52.769> or

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
is actually animals double plated or

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.250 
is actually animals double plated or
quad<00:03:53.550> plating<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.390> just<00:03:54.570> double<00:03:54.900> plated

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
quad plating this is just double plated

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.759 
quad plating this is just double plated
okay<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:56.220> anyway<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.820> eats<00:03:57.000> those<00:03:57.769> traces

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
okay but anyway it eats those traces

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.710 
okay but anyway it eats those traces
away<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.550> they<00:03:59.670> played<00:04:00.120> through<00:04:00.330> holes<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
away that they played through holes and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.350 
away that they played through holes and
they<00:04:00.810> still<00:04:01.110> look<00:04:01.320> kind<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.709> normal<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.360> very

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
they still look kind of normal and very

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.509 
they still look kind of normal and very
difficult<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.440> tell<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.830> do<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.280> full

service manual vessel makes a little bit

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.770 
service manual vessel makes a little bit
easier<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.459> motherboard<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.510> same

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
easier on the motherboard it's the same

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.860 
easier on the motherboard it's the same
situation<00:04:10.739> every<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.880> these<00:04:11.970> caps<00:04:12.299> has<00:04:12.570> to

situation every one of these caps has to
changed<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.799> have<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.129> clean<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.640> acid

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
changed and you have to clean the acid

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.170 
changed and you have to clean the acid
the<00:04:15.420> old<00:04:15.540> electrolyte<00:04:16.350> off<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.769> board<00:04:17.180> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the old electrolyte off the board you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.610 
the old electrolyte off the board you
have<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.510> don't<00:04:18.780> leave<00:04:18.959> anything<00:04:19.320> behind

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
have to don't leave anything behind

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.670 
have to don't leave anything behind
because<00:04:20.160> if<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.430> do<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:21.120> won't<00:04:21.510> work<00:04:21.750> then

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
because if you do it won't work then

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.350 
because if you do it won't work then
after<00:04:23.040> you're<00:04:23.130> all<00:04:23.340> done<00:04:23.550> with<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:23.850> then<00:04:24.090> you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
after you're all done with that then you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.730 
after you're all done with that then you
put<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.660> back<00:04:24.810> together<00:04:25.020> again<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.590> you're

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
put it back together again and you're

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.080 
put it back together again and you're
going<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.919> discover<00:04:26.160> what<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.699> missed<00:04:26.910> the

here<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.960> is<00:04:52.110> kind<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.470> long<00:04:52.680> video<00:04:52.889> but<00:04:53.070> I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
here this is kind of a long video but I

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.379 
here this is kind of a long video but I
mean<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:53.580> think<00:04:53.639> these<00:04:54.000> things<00:04:54.060> are

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
mean I think these things are

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.480 
mean I think these things are
interesting<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.169> there<00:04:55.500> therefore<00:04:56.280> they<00:04:56.460> are

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
interesting so there therefore they are

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.810 
interesting so there therefore they are
covered<00:04:57.289> mmm<00:04:58.289> this<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.740> remember<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.460> seers

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
this when it came this is a 1992 Sears

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.659 
this when it came this is a 1992 Sears
wishbone<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.690> here<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.110> have<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.320> GV<00:05:07.680> 200<00:05:08.520> here

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
wishbone and here you have a GV 200 here

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.189 
wishbone and here you have a GV 200 here
in<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.720> catalog<00:05:10.229> it<00:05:10.740> was<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.870> thousand<00:05:12.870> dollars

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
in the catalog it was a thousand dollars

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.900 
in the catalog it was a thousand dollars
in<00:05:13.490> 1992<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:15.660> GV<00:05:16.110> 300<00:05:16.950> was<00:05:17.250> almost<00:05:17.520> two

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
in 1992 the GV 300 was almost two

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.210 
in 1992 the GV 300 was almost two
thousand<00:05:18.630> dollars<00:05:19.020> than<00:05:19.650> because<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
thousand dollars than because of the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.029 
thousand dollars than because of the
stereo<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.240> also<00:05:21.389> came<00:05:21.900> with<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.200> plug<00:05:22.800> for

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
stereo and it also came with a plug for

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.920 
stereo and it also came with a plug for
a<00:05:23.099> camera<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.580> camera<00:05:23.789> is<00:05:24.030> optional<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:24.810> was

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
a camera the camera is optional that was

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.629 
a camera the camera is optional that was
probably<00:05:25.110> another<00:05:25.320> fifteen<00:05:25.860> hundred<00:05:26.340> dollars

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
probably another fifteen hundred dollars

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.940 
probably another fifteen hundred dollars
so<00:05:27.330> that's<00:05:27.450> why<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.690> think<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.229> worth<00:05:28.500> we

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
so that's why I think it's worth we

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.710 
so that's why I think it's worth we
having<00:05:29.370> these<00:05:29.520> rather<00:05:30.120> than<00:05:30.180> see<00:05:30.419> them<00:05:30.450> turn

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
having these rather than see them turn

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920 
having these rather than see them turn
into<00:05:30.930> landfill<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.520> just<00:05:32.669> another<00:05:32.930> in

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
into landfill so this is just another in

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.200 
into landfill so this is just another in
the<00:05:34.289> near<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:35.010> near<00:05:35.400> distant<00:05:35.970> future

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
the near just near distant future

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.969 
the near just near distant future
because<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.990> want<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.320> get<00:05:37.380> some<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:37.800> crap

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
because I want to get some of this crap

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.440 
because I want to get some of this crap
out<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.340> your<00:05:38.520> stuff<00:05:38.849> that's<00:05:38.970> not<00:05:39.090> going<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.419> be
