00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this is going to be a short tutorial for

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.319 
this is going to be a short tutorial for
a<00:00:22.020> friend<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.410> mine<00:00:22.619> who<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.730> asking<00:00:24.150> me

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
a friend of mine who is was asking me

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.650 
a friend of mine who is was asking me
about<00:00:24.360> how<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> put<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.060> roof

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
about how to put a little you know roof

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.339 
about how to put a little you know roof
or<00:00:27.960> concrete<00:00:28.470> roof<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:30.230> like<00:00:31.230> an

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
or concrete roof on a like an

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130 
or concrete roof on a like an
underground<00:00:31.589> shelter<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.629> going<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
underground shelter so I'm going to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
underground shelter so I'm going to
start<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.589> by<00:00:34.650> assuming<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.390> already

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
start off by assuming that you already

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.710 
start off by assuming that you already
have<00:00:37.080> your<00:00:37.350> walls<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:38.280> floor<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.360> I'm

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
have your walls your floor and I'm

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.520 
have your walls your floor and I'm
showing<00:00:39.900> here<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.470> like<00:00:40.589> a<00:00:40.620> turn<00:00:40.949> down<00:00:41.250> slab

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
showing here just like a turn down slab

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.899 
showing here just like a turn down slab
concrete<00:00:43.530> slab<00:00:43.799> just<00:00:44.220> turned<00:00:44.549> down<00:00:44.729> around

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
concrete slab just turned down around

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.509 
concrete slab just turned down around
the<00:00:45.089> edges<00:00:45.530> for<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.040> give<00:00:47.339> it<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
the edges for it to have a give it a

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.880 
the edges for it to have a give it a
footing<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.269> I'm<00:00:48.900> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.500> assume<00:00:49.830> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
footing and I'm going to assume that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.149 
footing and I'm going to assume that
this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.519> either<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:51.269> concrete<00:00:51.989> block<00:00:52.260> wall<00:00:52.739> or

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
this is either a concrete block wall or

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.969 
this is either a concrete block wall or
a<00:00:53.220> poured<00:00:54.150> concrete<00:00:54.869> wall<00:00:55.439> which<00:00:55.650> would<00:00:55.799> be

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
a poured concrete wall which would be

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.729 
a poured concrete wall which would be
better<00:00:56.189> but<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.080> can<00:00:58.229> understand<00:00:58.619> why

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
better but you know I can understand why

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.950 
better but you know I can understand why
people<00:00:58.769> want<00:00:59.369> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> list<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.750> least

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
people want to do the list the least

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
people want to do the list the least
expensive<00:01:01.670> thing<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.269> would<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
expensive thing here and that would be a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
expensive thing here and that would be a
concrete<00:01:04.170> block<00:01:04.379> wall<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> would<00:01:04.920> suggest<00:01:05.309> if

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
concrete block wall I would suggest if

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.249 
concrete block wall I would suggest if
you're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> concrete<00:01:06.960> block

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
you're going to use a concrete block

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.609 
you're going to use a concrete block
wall<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.060> pour<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> cells<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
wall here that you pour the cells of the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
wall here that you pour the cells of the
concrete<00:01:11.070> block<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.580> concrete<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> put

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
concrete block with concrete and put

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
concrete block with concrete and put
some<00:01:12.689> rebar<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.230> there<00:01:13.440> because<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.550> are

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
some rebar in there because you are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820 
some rebar in there because you are
going<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.900> dirt<00:01:16.230> back<00:01:16.530> field

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
going to have you know dirt back field

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
going to have you know dirt back field
against<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.360> let's<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.600> start<00:01:18.870> out<00:01:18.990> with

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
against it so let's just start out with

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
against it so let's just start out with
some<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.470> components<00:01:20.270> here<00:01:21.270> let<00:01:21.870> me<00:01:21.960> turn

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
some of the components here let me turn

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.560 
some of the components here let me turn
my<00:01:22.290> layers<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.030> thing<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.330> want

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
my layers on and the first thing we want

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.160 
my layers on and the first thing we want
to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> install<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.700> concrete<00:01:26.700> deck<00:01:27.170> which

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to do is install the concrete deck which

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
to do is install the concrete deck which
is<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:29.930> metal<00:01:30.930> pan<00:01:31.170> basically<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
is just a metal pan basically that you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.020 
is just a metal pan basically that you
can<00:01:33.240> buy<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.170> local<00:01:34.580> concrete<00:01:35.580> supplier

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
can buy at your local concrete supplier

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.610 
can buy at your local concrete supplier
you<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:36.960> rebar<00:01:37.409> top<00:01:37.770> supplier<00:01:38.659> place<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
you know rebar top supplier place and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.130 
you know rebar top supplier place and
it's<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.159> metal<00:01:41.550> pan<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it's just a metal pan and it's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.760 
it's just a metal pan and it's
corrugated<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.280> fashion<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.620> so<00:01:46.620> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
corrugated in this fashion here so it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.550 
corrugated in this fashion here so it
actually<00:01:47.040> perform<00:01:48.020> creates<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.320> sorry

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
actually perform creates I'm sorry

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.120 
actually perform creates I'm sorry
creates<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.580> structural<00:01:51.240> deck<00:01:52.010> after<00:01:53.010> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
creates a structural deck after the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
creates a structural deck after the
concrete<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.700> poured<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.810> trying<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
concrete is poured I'm just trying to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.910 
concrete is poured I'm just trying to
give<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:57.170> view<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.620> finally

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
give you a little view there and finally

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.940 
give you a little view there and finally
I'm<00:01:59.040> using<00:01:59.190> Sketchup<00:01:59.640> probe<00:02:00.270> 8<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:01.470> for<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
I'm using Sketchup probe 8 here for this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm using Sketchup probe 8 here for this
tutorial<00:02:02.510> so<00:02:03.510> I've<00:02:03.659> you've<00:02:03.870> got<00:02:04.020> your

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
tutorial so I've you've got your

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
tutorial so I've you've got your
concrete<00:02:04.560> pan<00:02:04.950> installed<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.970> what<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> do

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
concrete pan installed and what you do

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.410 
concrete pan installed and what you do
is<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> keep<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.020> back<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> edges<00:02:08.420> let's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is you keep it back from the edges let's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
is you keep it back from the edges let's
say<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.690> walls<00:02:10.049> 8<00:02:10.409> inches<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.459> want

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
say this walls 8 inches you don't want

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.229 
say this walls 8 inches you don't want
to<00:02:11.790> bear<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.170> concrete<00:02:13.650> wall<00:02:14.250> you

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
to bear this on the concrete wall you

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.059 
to bear this on the concrete wall you
know<00:02:15.330> 4<00:02:15.569> inches<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.260> give<00:02:16.409> yourself<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.920> little

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
know 4 inches to give yourself a little

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.119 
know 4 inches to give yourself a little
space<00:02:17.279> there<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.849> turn<00:02:18.029> the<00:02:18.239> edges<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:19.129> the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
space there to turn the edges down the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.050 
space there to turn the edges down the
next<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.609> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:20.999> is<00:02:21.150> probably

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
next thing you want to do is probably

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.930 
next thing you want to do is probably
depending<00:02:22.989> on<00:02:23.080> how<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.580> dirt<00:02:24.580> you're<00:02:24.849> gonna

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
depending on how much dirt you're gonna

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.570 
depending on how much dirt you're gonna
be<00:02:25.120> having<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.630> top<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.080> thing<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.709> break

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
be having on top of this thing I break

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.440 
be having on top of this thing I break
them<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.880> putting<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.420> grid<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.870> rebar<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:30.450> in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
them in putting a grid of rebar in in

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
them in putting a grid of rebar in in
the<00:02:31.810> concrete<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.190> I'm<00:02:33.340> showing<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the concrete and this is I'm showing you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.800 
the concrete and this is I'm showing you
a<00:02:33.790> half-inch<00:02:34.620> rebar<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.980> 12<00:02:36.880> inches<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.330> Center

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
a half-inch rebar of 12 inches on Center

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380 
a half-inch rebar of 12 inches on Center
and<00:02:38.560> again<00:02:38.739> you'd<00:02:39.160> hold<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.670> back<00:02:39.970> from<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and again you'd hold that back from the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.979 
and again you'd hold that back from the
edges<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.920> won't<00:02:42.400> cover<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.660> want<00:02:43.870> to

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
edges and you won't cover you want to

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.900 
edges and you won't cover you want to
cover<00:02:44.260> your<00:02:44.500> rebar<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.250> least<00:02:45.430> three<00:02:45.730> inches

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
cover your rebar at least three inches

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.259 
cover your rebar at least three inches
all<00:02:46.480> all<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.459> don't<00:02:48.640> want<00:02:48.790> your<00:02:48.880> rebar

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
all all around you don't want your rebar

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.089 
all all around you don't want your rebar
to<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.510> close<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.080> edges<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:51.069> your

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
to be close to the edges of your

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.770 
to be close to the edges of your
concrete<00:02:51.550> because<00:02:51.760> they'll<00:02:51.940> rest<00:02:52.239> out<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
concrete because they'll rest out and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.770 
concrete because they'll rest out and
start<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.620> form<00:02:53.830> cracks<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> rebar

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
start to form cracks and then the rebar

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.670 
start to form cracks and then the rebar
will<00:02:56.019> start<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.350> deteriorate<00:02:56.610> itself<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
will start to deteriorate itself so the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.140 
will start to deteriorate itself so the
next<00:02:59.890> next<00:03:00.100> thing<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.430> want<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> do<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.970> you'll

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
next next thing you want to do is you'll

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.289 
next next thing you want to do is you'll
put<00:03:01.269> your<00:03:01.540> wet<00:03:02.350> form<00:03:02.680> up<00:03:02.890> which<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> two

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
put your wet form up which is like a two

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.039 
put your wet form up which is like a two
by<00:03:04.450> ten<00:03:05.130> around<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> edges<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.360> again

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
by ten around the edges and again

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.430 
by ten around the edges and again
depending<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.510> know<00:03:10.569> do<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> make<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.260> at

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
twelve feet of dirt on top of this thing

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.900 
twelve feet of dirt on top of this thing
and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.780> cave<00:03:35.170> in<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.130> after

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
and then have it cave in on you so after

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
and then have it cave in on you so after
I<00:03:36.940> break<00:03:37.209> them<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.510> at<00:03:37.630> least<00:03:37.780> six<00:03:38.140> inches<00:03:38.319> six

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
I break them in at least six inches six

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.090 
I break them in at least six inches six
to<00:03:39.160> eight<00:03:39.250> inches<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.640> concrete<00:03:40.269> here<00:03:41.100> and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
to eight inches of concrete here and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.349 
to eight inches of concrete here and
then<00:03:42.250> next<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.700> that's<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.150> you're<00:03:43.269> gonna

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
then next that that's all you're gonna

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.759 
then next that that's all you're gonna
do<00:03:43.540> next<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.200> pour<00:03:44.470> your<00:03:44.620> concrete<00:03:44.829> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
do next is just pour your concrete and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.220 
do next is just pour your concrete and
let<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.859> go<00:03:47.980> over<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.400> your<00:03:48.489> form<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.230> then

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
let it go over to your form and then

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.250 
let it go over to your form and then
basically<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:50.889> have<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:52.450> structure<00:03:52.810> and

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
basically you have your structure and

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.229 
basically you have your structure and
I'd<00:03:54.069> say<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> could<00:03:54.579> probably<00:03:54.730> put<00:03:55.090> at<00:03:55.180> least

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
I'd say you could probably put at least

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.300 
I'd say you could probably put at least
two<00:03:55.569> or<00:03:55.630> three<00:03:55.810> feet<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.230> dirt<00:03:56.560> on<00:03:56.829> top<00:03:57.069> of<00:03:57.220> this

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
two or three feet of dirt on top of this

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.550 
two or three feet of dirt on top of this
thing<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:57.850> of<00:03:58.690> course<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.139> know<00:03:59.230> when<00:03:59.440> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
thing and of course you know when the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.590 
thing and of course you know when the
concrete<00:03:59.980> sets<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:00.489> take<00:04:00.910> your<00:04:01.120> form<00:04:01.389> off

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
concrete sets up take your form off

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.780 
concrete sets up take your form off
you've<00:04:02.350> got<00:04:02.530> something<00:04:02.920> basically<00:04:03.370> like<00:04:03.549> this

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
you've got something basically like this

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.699 
you've got something basically like this
of<00:04:04.329> course<00:04:04.389> this<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.260> corner

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
of course this is just a corner

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.379 
of course this is just a corner
obviously<00:04:06.220> these<00:04:06.850> walls<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:07.660> know<00:04:09.389> however

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
obviously these walls you know however

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.370 
obviously these walls you know however
you<00:04:10.630> decide<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:12.670> know<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.850> make<00:04:13.180> them<00:04:13.450> you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
you decide you know to make them you

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.310 
you decide you know to make them you
just<00:04:14.650> extend<00:04:15.040> them<00:04:15.250> out<00:04:15.720> in<00:04:16.720> whatever

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
just extend them out in whatever

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.990 
just extend them out in whatever
direction<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:18.489> know<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.669> same

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
direction you know and so on the same

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.330
