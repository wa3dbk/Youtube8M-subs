the device obviously unlike most other
smartphones<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.109> any<00:00:19.830> buttons<00:00:20.220> at

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
smartphones we don't have any buttons at

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.370 
smartphones we don't have any buttons at
the<00:00:20.400> bottom<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> screen<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.510> let's<00:00:22.260> look

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the bottom of the screen so let's look

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
the bottom of the screen so let's look
at<00:00:22.500> unlocking<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> device<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:24.300> off<00:00:24.510> the

at unlocking the device first off the
note<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> there's<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.230> options<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
note and there's two options to do this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
note and there's two options to do this
you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> either<00:00:26.699> use<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> power<00:00:27.210> button<00:00:27.510> at

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you can either use the power button at

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
you can either use the power button at
the<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:27.869> by<00:00:28.050> giving<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> quick<00:00:29.010> press<00:00:29.310> but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the top by giving that a quick press but

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
the top by giving that a quick press but
I<00:00:30.060> never<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.619> no<00:00:31.650> point

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I never do that because there's no point

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
I never do that because there's no point
because<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.460> need<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.090> perform<00:00:33.570> an

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because all you need to do is perform an

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
because all you need to do is perform an
an<00:00:33.989> upwards<00:00:34.380> gesture<00:00:34.829> from<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> bottom<00:00:35.790> of

an upwards gesture from the bottom of
the<00:00:35.969> screen<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.750> would<00:00:36.960> unlock<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the screen and that would unlock the

down from the the top bezel as well and
that<00:01:26.100> gives<00:01:26.280> us<00:01:26.400> access<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> our<00:01:26.939> settings<00:01:27.299> and

stuff like that and the same applies

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.280 
stuff like that and the same applies
within<00:01:29.159> most<00:01:29.430> applications<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.900> jump<00:01:31.110> into

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
within most applications if we jump into

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.580 
within most applications if we jump into
the<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:33.390> crack<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> application<00:01:34.500> again

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the the the crack the application again

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
the the the crack the application again
pulling<00:01:35.310> down<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:37.140> gives<00:01:37.380> us

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
pulling down from the the top gives us

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
pulling down from the the top gives us
access<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.759> account<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> our<00:01:39.299> settings

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
access to our account and our settings

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
access to our account and our settings
and<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> say<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.130> applies<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.729> most

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and as I say that that applies to most

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.280 
and as I say that that applies to most
applications<00:01:43.310> within<00:01:44.810> within<00:01:46.130> blackberry<00:01:47.130> 10

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
applications within within blackberry 10

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
applications within within blackberry 10
let's<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.890> find<00:01:50.070> another<00:01:50.159> example

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
let's see if we can find another example

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
let's see if we can find another example
there<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.720> Twitter<00:01:52.079> again<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.100> pull

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there we go Twitter again we can pull

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
there we go Twitter again we can pull
down<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.820> they'll<00:01:54.060> give<00:01:54.210> us<00:01:54.329> access<00:01:54.509> just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
down and they'll give us access just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.069 
down and they'll give us access just
settings<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:57.329> other<00:01:57.450> thing<00:01:57.659> that's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
settings the other thing that's

and there's two ways to get out of this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.150 
and there's two ways to get out of this
either<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.610> perform<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.510> left<00:02:24.630> swipe<00:02:25.160> or

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
either you can perform a left swipe or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
either you can perform a left swipe or
what<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.550> always<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:27.840> perform<00:02:28.140> an

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
what I always do you just perform an

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.260 
what I always do you just perform an
upward<00:02:28.530> swipe<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> again<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:29.760> exactly<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
upward swipe and again it's exactly the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.300 
upward swipe and again it's exactly the
same<00:02:30.450> whatever<00:02:30.900> application<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
same whatever application you're in you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.470
