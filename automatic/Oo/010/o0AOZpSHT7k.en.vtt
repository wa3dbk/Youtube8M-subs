straddle is you can take any three note
chord

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
chord

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.589 
chord
let's<00:00:12.420> take<00:00:12.630> D<00:00:12.990> minor<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.849> you<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.059> straddle

let's take D minor and you can straddle

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.050 
let's take D minor and you can straddle
it<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.900> leaving<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.590> middle<00:00:16.740> no<00:00:16.949> doubt<00:00:17.160> leave

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
it by leaving the middle no doubt leave

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.450 
it by leaving the middle no doubt leave
the<00:00:18.240> middle<00:00:18.390> no<00:00:18.600> doubt<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.710> then<00:00:20.010> move<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the middle no doubt but then move to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.480 
the middle no doubt but then move to
another<00:00:20.490> inversion<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> D<00:00:23.279> minor

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

another inversion of the of the D minor
chord<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:24.029> example<00:00:24.449> I'm<00:00:24.539> playing<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
chord for example I'm playing the the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
chord for example I'm playing the the
root<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> fifth<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.460> D<00:00:26.789> minor<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
root and the fifth of D minor and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.730 
root and the fifth of D minor and
leaving<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> third<00:00:28.590> out<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.070> F<00:00:29.310> okay<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.740> but

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
leaving the third out the F okay and but

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.049

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
now I'm gonna play the F with the other

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.600 
now I'm gonna play the F with the other
note<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> D<00:00:37.110> minor<00:00:37.350> chord<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610

you see that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.330 
you see that
it's<00:00:44.050> called<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.440> straddle<00:00:44.980> because<00:00:45.190> you're

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
it's called a straddle because you're

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.279 
it's called a straddle because you're
straddling<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:46.000> middle<00:00:46.239> notes<00:00:46.449> it's<00:00:47.079> like

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
straddling the middle notes it's like

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.290 
straddling the middle notes it's like
you're<00:00:47.530> on<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.680> highway<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.430> you<00:00:48.550> you're

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
you're on a highway and you you're

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
you're on a highway and you you're
avoiding<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:50.260> white<00:00:50.440> line<00:00:50.710> there<00:00:51.039> okay

avoiding the the white line there okay
you're<00:00:52.629> straddling<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.260> let's<00:00:54.100> do<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
you're straddling it let's do it on the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.310 
you're straddling it let's do it on the
C<00:00:54.609> chord<00:00:54.850> maybe<00:00:55.210> easier<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.690> see<00:00:55.870> there's<00:00:56.079> C

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
C chord maybe easier to see there's C

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.069 
C chord maybe easier to see there's C
chord<00:00:56.559> okay<00:00:56.800> if<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.430> play<00:00:57.670> them<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.690> root<00:00:58.930> in

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
chord okay if I play them the root in

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.090 
chord okay if I play them the root in
the<00:00:59.170> fifth<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.680> I<00:00:59.739> can<00:00:59.949> go<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:02.100> the
