 paolo service communication attacks 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 the phone if not do not play precisely 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.570
 how would I be asking myself before that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.349

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.179
 davide however also to capri maulo leader 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.250

 with le berre in the province of Rome makes the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 second pianella fundamental to ok a 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.370
 Daniele drove us every year 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.809
 given the wrong names are the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 eliminatory a bit of seriousness I am 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 trying to be the ad hoc presenter 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.890
 it is said but to docs anyway daniele 11 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
 years with wars or second media 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 plays the piano plays basketball on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.689
 his ranking was 150 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.930
 thousand and 250 points is called david though 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 have written daniele is a bit of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 confusion but in the meantime by daniele davide 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.340
 went to the second level without 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.860
 not even one mistake took even one 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 chocolate snacks totaled 4,700 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 accounts still available chance 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.890
 we are in the woods 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 you will never forgive that we go to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.210
 see we hope 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 I remember that Daniel is not daniele davide 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 daniele davide will remember it maybe 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 will become the super champion a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.049
 process I also agree because 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.789
 I have to say is playing very well because 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.740
 he passed to the third level without either 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.280
 a mistake took 2 net chocolate 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 7 1,250 points 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.810
 this is a delicate phase always in iii 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810
 level 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.330
 attention is always david playing 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.000
 even if it says daniele passing 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.239
 the fourth level with three more chances 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.239

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.760
 David's ranking was 150 thousand 250 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 boutique will succeed davide to overcome the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.000
 his personal record 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 meanwhile he took 5 chocolate snacks 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 I'm really playing a good game 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.520
 this is a delicate phase because there is 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.710
 I remember increasing the levels 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.690
 the difficulties increase and then he is the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.390
 ghost let us hope he is lenient 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.430
