00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.080
 and something has changed here inside 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.390
 do not say that I changed before let 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.890
 or not only live the present because never 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.290

 words if you feel them I keep to the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.690
 margin of those who always insult me 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.239
 because I 've always been one of those who swam 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.580
 against the current I am aware that 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.370
 I never have enough nobody could 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.750
 with me let the next one pass 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 endured so much and more to endure is 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.730
 surely I learned to love myself 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.070
 because everything is in the mind, watch every 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.900
 step maybe one of you regret you are 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.150
 owner of your acts so I know 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.730
 consequently I seek to be a better person 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.800
 I only swear to you for my life that I do not 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.710
 something change 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 and that also reflects that that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.930
 reflected in my music is for you is for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 me something has changed because I needed 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.000
 feel happy again something has changed 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.280
 in me something has changed in me I know that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.009
 it reflects that I reflect that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.229
 here my music is for you my music is 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 for you something has changed because I felt 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.840
 that it must be like that and that child was made 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 man necessarily pass through so many 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.549
 things suddenly looking towards nothing 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.350
 I was and the absent look I was looking for in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.810
 little things and I did not find 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.690
 inducements she came to find me some 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 time but I stared at her I can not leave 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 still because I have outstanding things I'm from 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.500
 those who believe that things do not happen 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.750
 fortunately one collects what sows 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.819
 the sweat of his forehead my family believed 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.740
 in me and that made me stronger I snuffed 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.720
 it's so different nobody will love 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 eternally I trust my people 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.890
 blindly though sometimes I got disoriented 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 I am my sustenance, I try to be 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 demanding something has changed has changed 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.100
 although I was also a teenager, it does not 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.600
 so much that they beat my impulses that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.700
 they were hot always 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.530
 and brave but now smarter 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
 and I know that time will put everyone where 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.810
 you should just know something has changed in my 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.820
 hand has changed says that that reflects 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.100

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.740
 music is for you to be here something has 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 changed because I needed to feel 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.810

 changed because I felt that I should be like that 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.140
 I consider myself a clear person and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.690
 transparent I go face and without anything 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 for it's because I'm brave I just do 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.250
 music and you let me orient you 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.950
 I liked the zamba and in my bed it continues 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.990
 currently something has changed is evident 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.450
 I've been happy again this time 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.090
 maybe it's not permanent I will not complain 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.800
 I chose the path voluntarily I ask 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.170
 another opportunity to do it 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.390
 correctly sometimes it's better to bite the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.130
 tongue and grit teeth sure 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.710
 you have also said things that are not 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.240
 you feel life puts obstacles and baits 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.790
 so they understand you but 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.190
 only zatti will fail you if he lies to you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 and you lie if you, who was going to 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.410
 say when I was a kid only 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.140
