gameplay in this video but I will be

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
gameplay in this video but I will be
showing<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.940> various<00:00:09.360> combinations<00:00:10.019> of

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
showing you the various combinations of

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.490 
showing you the various combinations of
the<00:00:10.920> matrix<00:00:11.460> shard<00:00:11.670> colors<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.349> can

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the matrix shard colors that you can

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.499 
the matrix shard colors that you can
combine<00:00:13.710> together<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.519> make<00:00:14.700> relics<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.420> if

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
combine together to make relics so if

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.180 
combine together to make relics so if
you<00:00:15.599> want<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> specific<00:00:16.410> level<00:00:16.949> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you want to see a specific level of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.769 
you want to see a specific level of
relics<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.760> click<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.420> three

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
relics you can click one of the three

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.019 
relics you can click one of the three
annotations<00:00:19.410> below<00:00:19.740> anyways<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.699> going

annotations below anyways we are going

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
annotations below anyways we are going
to<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.330> started<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> level<00:00:22.439> 15<00:00:22.859> relics

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
to get started with the level 15 relics

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.420 
to get started with the level 15 relics
first<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.980> all<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.099> guys<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
first so here we go all right guys the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.460 
first so here we go all right guys the
following<00:00:26.910> menu<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.720> list<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
following menu is the list of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.980 
following menu is the list of
combinations<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.519> level<00:00:29.970> 15<00:00:30.359> relics<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
combinations for the level 15 relics and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.069 
combinations for the level 15 relics and
the<00:00:31.890> bonuses<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.759> those<00:00:32.969> relics<00:00:33.450> give<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the bonuses that those relics give and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
the bonuses that those relics give and
under<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> combinations<00:00:35.670> column<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.210> will

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
under the combinations column you will

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.190 
under the combinations column you will
see<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.780> letters<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> obviously<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.670> R

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
see three letters and obviously the R

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.170 
see three letters and obviously the R
means<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.500> red<00:00:40.800> matrix<00:00:41.160> shard<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> blue<00:00:41.940> means

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
means a red matrix shard the blue means

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
means a red matrix shard the blue means
a<00:00:42.270> blue<00:00:42.450> matrix<00:00:42.629> shard<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> think

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a blue matrix shard and so on I think

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
a blue matrix shard and so on I think
you<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> picture<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:46.140> you'd<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you get the picture if you'd like to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
you get the picture if you'd like to
write<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.640> anything<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.149> can

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
write these down or anything you can

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.760 
write these down or anything you can
pause<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> video<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.739> are

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
pause the video right now but we are

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
pause the video right now but we are
going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.129> move<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.610> level<00:00:51.390> 24<00:00:52.110> relics<00:00:52.469> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
going to move on to level 24 relics so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to move on to level 24 relics so
here<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.390> notice<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here it is and you will notice that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
here it is and you will notice that
instead<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> only<00:00:55.770> four<00:00:56.100> combinations<00:00:56.730> there

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
instead of only four combinations there

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
instead of only four combinations there
is<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.270> six<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.320> you'll<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.680> notice<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is now six but you'll also notice that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
is now six but you'll also notice that
some<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.539> same<00:01:00.780> item

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
some of them have these same item

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
some of them have these same item
bonuses<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:02.250> entirely<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
bonuses not entirely sure if this was a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
bonuses not entirely sure if this was a
bog<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.379> beta<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.250> entirely

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
bog back in beta but I'm not entirely

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
bog back in beta but I'm not entirely
sure<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.630> please<00:01:07.200> let<00:01:07.409> me<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.740> you've

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sure so please let me know if you've

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
sure so please let me know if you've
tried<00:01:08.070> some<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.520> combinations<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
tried some of these combinations and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
tried some of these combinations and
they're<00:01:09.630> giving<00:01:10.020> different<00:01:10.320> item<00:01:10.830> bonuses

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they're giving different item bonuses

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
they're giving different item bonuses
because<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.180> assuming<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.840> bug<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.200> been

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because I'm assuming that bug has been

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
because I'm assuming that bug has been
fixed<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.240> know

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
fixed by now but I don't really know

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
fixed by now but I don't really know
maybe<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> meant<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.799> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
maybe it's meant to be like that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
maybe it's meant to be like that
anyways<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.270> move<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
anyways we are gonna move on to the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
anyways we are gonna move on to the
level<00:01:19.650> 32<00:01:19.979> relic<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> you'll

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
level 32 relic so here it is and you'll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
level 32 relic so here it is and you'll
see<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.470> lot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> them<00:01:23.040> give<00:01:23.310> quite<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> bit

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
see that a lot of them give quite a bit

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
see that a lot of them give quite a bit
of<00:01:23.970> stats<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.509> has<00:01:24.689> resulted<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.799> pretty

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of stats which has resulted in a pretty

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.899 
of stats which has resulted in a pretty
much<00:01:27.030> jumbled<00:01:27.750> mess<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.560> video<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> do

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
much jumbled mess on this video so I do

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
much jumbled mess on this video so I do
apologize<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.079> hard<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> read

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
apologize for that if it's hard to read

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
apologize for that if it's hard to read
tried<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> color<00:01:32.700> coordinated<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
tried to do it color coordinated so it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
tried to do it color coordinated so it
might<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.170> easier<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.850> when

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
might be a bit easier but yeah when

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
might be a bit easier but yeah when
there's<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.329> many<00:01:36.420> stats<00:01:36.780> fit<00:01:37.140> trying<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> fit

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
there's so many stats fit trying to fit
