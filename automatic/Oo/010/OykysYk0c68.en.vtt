those are bikes with a lot more travel

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.670 
those are bikes with a lot more travel
with<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.209> lot<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.720> trouble<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.470> one's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
yeah Oh God I came into this thing

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.990 
yeah Oh God I came into this thing
thinking<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.590> had<00:02:27.739> 100<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.370> because<00:02:28.670> I

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
thinking that it had 100 just because I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.610 
thinking that it had 100 just because I
assumed<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.629> it<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> cross-country<00:02:30.349> bike

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
assumed that it was a cross-country bike

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.199 
assumed that it was a cross-country bike
I<00:02:30.709> had<00:02:30.860> 100<00:02:31.159> mils<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> travel<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.849> those<00:02:32.030> do

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
I had 100 mils to travel like those do

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.740 
I had 100 mils to travel like those do
and<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.560> thought<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.519> had<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.700> lot<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.209> felt<00:02:35.510> I

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and I thought it had a lot I felt I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.570 
and I thought it had a lot I felt I
thought<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.379> felt<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.069> had<00:02:37.220> more

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
thought that it felt like it had more

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850 
thought that it felt like it had more
than<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.959> thinking<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.110> was<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> hundred<00:02:39.620> mils

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
than that thinking it was a hundred mils

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.500 
than that thinking it was a hundred mils
so<00:02:39.920> you've<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.310> add<00:02:40.370> more<00:02:40.430> than<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.790> notice

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
so you've got to add more than a notice

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.229 
so you've got to add more than a notice
or<00:02:41.599> mil<00:02:41.840> travel<00:02:42.260> yeah<00:02:42.440> yeah<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:43.849> got<00:02:43.970> its

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
or mil travel yeah yeah and it's got its

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.270 
or mil travel yeah yeah and it's got its
80<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.900> can't<00:02:45.349> remember<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.829> last<00:02:45.980> time<00:02:46.129> I

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
80 I can't remember the last time I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.460 
80 I can't remember the last time I
wrote<00:02:46.610> an<00:02:46.760> 80<00:02:46.940> millimeter<00:02:47.360> travel<00:02:47.720> bike<00:02:47.870> it

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
wrote an 80 millimeter travel bike it

did the salsas goal with this was make

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.319 
did the salsas goal with this was make
an<00:02:56.690> efficient<00:02:57.140> bike<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:58.459> gave<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.090> very

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
an efficient bike that gave up very

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.759 
an efficient bike that gave up very
little<00:02:59.629> in<00:02:59.840> terms<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.290> pedaling<00:03:00.650> efficiency

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
little in terms of pedaling efficiency

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.949 
little in terms of pedaling efficiency
yeah<00:03:01.640> right<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.060> could<00:03:02.239> be<00:03:02.359> used<00:03:02.599> for<00:03:02.810> long

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
yeah right and could be used for long

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.300 
yeah right and could be used for long
distance<00:03:03.410> racing<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.829> that's<00:03:03.950> kind<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.190> their

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
distance racing and that's kind of their

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.640 
distance racing and that's kind of their
thing<00:03:04.370> right<00:03:04.579> it's<00:03:04.879> about<00:03:05.000> adventure<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
thing right it's about adventure so this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.140 
thing right it's about adventure so this
is<00:03:06.799> more<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.099> marathon<00:03:07.400> race<00:03:07.700> bike<00:03:07.940> and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
is more of a marathon race bike and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.910 
is more of a marathon race bike and
people<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.510> been<00:03:08.629> setting<00:03:08.989> records<00:03:09.769> and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
people have been setting records and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.770 
people have been setting records and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
long-distance sort of grueling races

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.930 
long-distance sort of grueling races
with<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.829> they<00:03:12.950> wanted<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.519> efficient

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
with it so they wanted to be efficient

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.030 
with it so they wanted to be efficient
but<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.239> wanted<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.870> be<00:03:15.079> capable<00:03:15.349> to<00:03:15.650> which

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
but they wanted to be capable to which

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.830 
but they wanted to be capable to which
is<00:03:16.159> obviously<00:03:16.459> what<00:03:16.640> we<00:03:16.760> found<00:03:16.879> out<00:03:17.150> that's

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
is obviously what we found out that's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.099 
is obviously what we found out that's
pretty<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.109> mean<00:03:18.409> it's<00:03:19.299> way<00:03:20.299> more<00:03:20.329> capable<00:03:20.989> than

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
pretty I mean it's way more capable than

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.830 
pretty I mean it's way more capable than
it<00:03:21.290> looks<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:23.090> mean<00:03:23.329> looking<00:03:23.599> at<00:03:23.659> that

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
it looks and I mean looking at that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.720 
it looks and I mean looking at that
little<00:03:24.019> shock<00:03:24.349> with<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.799> little<00:03:25.250> stroke

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
little shock with this little stroke

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.849 
little shock with this little stroke
you're<00:03:26.510> like<00:03:26.659> oh<00:03:26.900> that's<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.230> cute<00:03:27.409> little<00:03:27.590> bike

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
that it's gonna be kind of fun and then

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.800 
that it's gonna be kind of fun and then
you<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:31.069> get<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.849> just<00:03:32.060> rips<00:03:32.569> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
you you get on it and it just rips it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020 
you you get on it and it just rips it
like<00:03:33.049> absolutely<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:33.950> hairs<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.519> trail<00:03:34.790> up

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
like absolutely just hairs the trail up

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.289 
like absolutely just hairs the trail up
I<00:03:35.299> think<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.639> Spearfish

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
I think that the that Spearfish

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.789 
I think that the that Spearfish
surprised<00:03:39.139> me<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.319> lot<00:03:39.620> because<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.940> was<00:03:41.799> so

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
surprised me a lot because it was so

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.940 
surprised me a lot because it was so
much<00:03:43.400> fun<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:44.000> ride<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.840> was<00:03:44.959> fast<00:03:45.410> as<00:03:45.709> hell

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
much fun to ride but it was fast as hell

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.680 
much fun to ride but it was fast as hell
it<00:03:46.220> climbed<00:03:46.579> really<00:03:46.879> well<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.269> had<00:03:47.419> great

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
it climbed really well it had great

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.930 
it climbed really well it had great
traction<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.470> had<00:03:48.859> like<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.069> nice<00:03:49.340> pedaling

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
traction and had like a nice pedaling

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.270 
traction and had like a nice pedaling
platform<00:03:50.540> but<00:03:51.470> was<00:03:51.950> still<00:03:52.930> compliant<00:03:54.280> even

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
platform but was still compliant even

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.360 
platform but was still compliant even
when<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.549> were<00:03:55.639> on<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.849> gas<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.319> mean<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.709> had

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
when you were on the gas so I mean I had

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.280 
when you were on the gas so I mean I had
like<00:03:58.400> nice<00:03:59.150> kinematics<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.989> it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
like nice kinematics to it

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.330 
like nice kinematics to it
what'd<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.769> guys<00:04:00.859> think<00:04:00.919> about<00:04:01.160> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
what'd you guys think about the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.159 
what'd you guys think about the
components<00:04:01.819> back<00:04:01.910> well<00:04:02.510> let's<00:04:02.690> talk<00:04:02.870> about<00:04:03.139> I

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
components back well let's talk about I

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.000 
components back well let's talk about I
mean<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.949> actual<00:04:04.760> drivetrain<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:05.780> 2<00:04:06.349> by<00:04:06.500> 10<00:04:06.739> I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
mean the actual drivetrain is 2 by 10 I

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.759 
mean the actual drivetrain is 2 by 10 I
think<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.910> kind<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.239> meshes<00:04:09.169> with<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.410> whole

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
think that kind of meshes with the whole

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.550 
think that kind of meshes with the whole
you<00:04:10.430> know<00:04:10.489> all<00:04:10.760> day<00:04:11.000> adventure<00:04:11.599> like<00:04:12.260> big

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
you know all day adventure like big

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.229 
you know all day adventure like big
mountains<00:04:12.980> where<00:04:13.280> you're<00:04:13.400> on<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.639> maybe

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
mountains where you're on like maybe

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.779 
mountains where you're on like maybe
three<00:04:14.750> hour<00:04:14.870> grinder<00:04:15.709> climbs<00:04:16.039> it's<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.549> with

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
three hour grinder climbs it's just with

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.909 
three hour grinder climbs it's just with
no<00:04:17.090> relief<00:04:17.479> at<00:04:17.720> all<00:04:17.810> where<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.139> just<00:04:18.410> can't<00:04:18.650> be

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
no relief at all where you just can't be

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.979 
no relief at all where you just can't be
out<00:04:19.039> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.220> saddle<00:04:19.430> all<00:04:19.669> day<00:04:19.880> yeah<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.690> think

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
out of the saddle all day yeah I think

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.350 
out of the saddle all day yeah I think
they<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.560> would<00:04:22.039> assume<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.729> probably<00:04:23.060> make<00:04:23.270> me

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
they I would assume you probably make me

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.909 
they I would assume you probably make me
talk<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.690> salsa<00:04:23.930> bottom<00:04:24.289> I<00:04:24.380> would<00:04:24.500> assume<00:04:24.770> they

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
talk to salsa bottom I would assume they

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.310 
talk to salsa bottom I would assume they
put<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.280> there<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:26.449> know<00:04:26.539> intentionally

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
put that on there you know intentionally

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.650 
put that on there you know intentionally
for<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.740> purpose<00:04:28.160> adventure<00:04:28.639> Matic<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.270> that

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
for that purpose adventure Matic in that

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540 
for that purpose adventure Matic in that
yeah<00:04:29.990> they<00:04:30.410> have<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> fairly<00:04:30.919> low<00:04:31.070> gear<00:04:31.370> anymore

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
yeah they have a fairly low gear anymore

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.679 
yeah they have a fairly low gear anymore
the<00:04:31.849> SRAM<00:04:32.090> crank

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:32.689 
the SRAM crank

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.719 
the SRAM crank
the<00:04:33.080> difference<00:04:33.469> here<00:04:33.649> that's<00:04:34.069> the<00:04:34.189> only<00:04:34.369> non

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
the difference here that's the only non

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.549 
the difference here that's the only non
Shimano<00:04:35.149> part<00:04:35.449> of<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.629> the<00:04:35.839> drive<00:04:36.080> why<00:04:36.349> do<00:04:36.409> you

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:36.559 
Shimano part of the the drive why do you

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.379 
Shimano part of the the drive why do you
think<00:04:36.709> they<00:04:36.889> did<00:04:36.949> this<00:04:37.279> RAM<00:04:37.519> crank<00:04:37.819> I<00:04:37.999> think<00:04:38.330> it

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
think they did this RAM crank I think it

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.989 
think they did this RAM crank I think it
has<00:04:38.509> go<00:04:39.409> for<00:04:39.619> it

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:40.999 
has go for it

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:47.979 
has go for it
it<00:04:41.449> has<00:04:41.809> a<00:04:42.339> 22<00:04:43.339> to<00:04:44.289> right<00:04:45.289> and<00:04:46.599> Shimano<00:04:47.599> to<00:04:47.809> buy

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:47.989 
it has a 22 to right and Shimano to buy

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.789 
it has a 22 to right and Shimano to buy
do<00:04:48.559> they<00:04:48.679> even<00:04:48.799> do<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:49.009> 2014<00:04:49.699> there<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.539> buy<00:04:50.799> it's

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:51.799 
do they even do a 2014 there to buy it's

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:55.989 
do they even do a 2014 there to buy it's
usually<00:04:51.979> 26<00:04:52.579> so<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.839> think<00:04:54.799> that<00:04:55.069> was<00:04:55.159> extremely

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
usually 26 so I think that was extremely

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.049 
usually 26 so I think that was extremely
smart<00:04:56.239> spec<00:04:56.539> because<00:04:56.929> if<00:04:57.469> you<00:04:58.069> because<00:04:58.549> they

00:04:59.049 --> 00:04:59.059 
smart spec because if you because they

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.179 
smart spec because if you because they
do<00:04:59.119> a<00:04:59.239> 1<00:04:59.509> by<00:04:59.719> spec<00:05:00.379> option<00:05:00.739> on<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:00.979> buy

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
do a 1 by spec option on this buy

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:07.239 
do a 1 by spec option on this buy
correct<00:05:01.519> yeah<00:05:03.789> so<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:05.269> the<00:05:05.779> people<00:05:06.019> that<00:05:06.409> that

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:07.249 
correct yeah so the the people that that

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:08.919 
correct yeah so the the people that that
don't<00:05:07.729> have<00:05:07.939> a<00:05:07.969> limbless<00:05:08.269> bank<00:05:08.629> account

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:08.929 
don't have a limbless bank account

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.249 
don't have a limbless bank account
aren't<00:05:09.559> just<00:05:10.039> using<00:05:10.339> it<00:05:10.459> to<00:05:10.689> to<00:05:11.689> tip<00:05:12.139> the

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
aren't just using it to to tip the

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.959 
aren't just using it to to tip the
scales<00:05:12.559> and<00:05:13.009> be<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.249> lights<00:05:13.429> that<00:05:13.639> they<00:05:13.759> can

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
scales and be the lights that they can

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.059 
scales and be the lights that they can
they<00:05:14.899> want<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.199> use<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.409> as<00:05:15.529> a<00:05:15.589> venture<00:05:15.800> bike

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
they want to use it as a venture bike

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.479 
they want to use it as a venture bike
and<00:05:16.369> having<00:05:17.149> that<00:05:17.239> low<00:05:17.449> gear<00:05:17.749> especially<00:05:18.709> on

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:19.489 
and having that low gear especially on

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.519 
and having that low gear especially on
my<00:05:19.759> third<00:05:19.969> run<00:05:20.209> of<00:05:20.239> that<00:05:20.419> day<00:05:20.659> yeah<00:05:21.019> oh<00:05:21.199> it<00:05:21.409> was

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
my third run of that day yeah oh it was

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.609 
my third run of that day yeah oh it was
nice<00:05:22.089> mellow<00:05:23.089> I<00:05:23.269> took<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.599> round<00:05:23.809> run<00:05:24.229> you<00:05:24.439> had

00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:24.619 
nice mellow I took the round run you had

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:26.649 
nice mellow I took the round run you had
it<00:05:24.739> on<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.069> second<00:05:25.999> oh<00:05:26.119> yeah<00:05:26.360> that's<00:05:26.509> right

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
it on that second oh yeah that's right

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.299 
it on that second oh yeah that's right
so<00:05:26.929> it<00:05:27.050> seems<00:05:27.259> more<00:05:27.349> important<00:05:27.949> for<00:05:28.039> me<00:05:28.099> it

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:28.309 
so it seems more important for me it

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.389 
so it seems more important for me it
wasn't<00:05:28.459> yeah<00:05:29.289> no<00:05:30.289> we<00:05:30.439> saw<00:05:30.649> can<00:05:30.889> they'll<00:05:31.129> do<00:05:31.279> the

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:31.399
