water<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> house<00:00:12.049> but<00:00:13.049> then<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.530> wound<00:00:13.830> up

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
water to the house but then we wound up

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.210 
water to the house but then we wound up
with<00:00:14.190> city<00:00:14.460> water<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:16.170> never<00:00:16.440> even<00:00:16.650> used<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
with city water and I never even used it

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.000 
with city water and I never even used it
for<00:00:17.460> anything<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.350> died<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.949> was

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
for anything and so it died and that was

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.300 
for anything and so it died and that was
it<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.820> bought<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> cheap<00:00:21.510> pump<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.310> it's

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it so I bought this cheap pump here it's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.310 
it so I bought this cheap pump here it's
like<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> Harbor<00:00:24.029> Freight<00:00:24.240> thing<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:25.080> cheap

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
like a Harbor Freight thing really cheap

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
like a Harbor Freight thing really cheap
and<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> works

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and but it works

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
and but it works
most<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> time<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:29.400> thing<00:00:29.580> I've<00:00:29.699> noticed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
most of the time one thing I've noticed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.569 
most of the time one thing I've noticed
so<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.980> almost<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.550> daily

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so if I don't use it on almost a daily

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.200 
so if I don't use it on almost a daily
basis<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.930> haven't<00:00:34.170> done<00:00:34.350> recently<00:00:35.210> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
basis which I haven't done recently the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110 
basis which I haven't done recently the
rusts<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> water<00:00:37.530> will<00:00:38.070> freeze<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.579> pop<00:00:38.820> up

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
rusts in the water will freeze to pop up

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.080 
rusts in the water will freeze to pop up
to<00:00:39.660> where<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> won't<00:00:40.110> start<00:00:40.790> well<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.940> you've

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to where it won't start well if you've

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
to where it won't start well if you've
ever<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> happen<00:00:42.809> I've<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> little

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
ever had that happen I've got a little

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
ever had that happen I've got a little
bit<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> solution<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> drain

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
bit of a solution for you take the drain

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
bit of a solution for you take the drain
plug<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.239> fill<00:00:48.539> plug<00:00:48.780> let's<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.200> say

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
plug or the fill plug let's just say

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.540 
plug or the fill plug let's just say
prime<00:00:50.039> plug<00:00:50.309> off<00:00:50.550> add<00:00:51.350> some<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.160> go

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
prime plug off add some here we go

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.200 
prime plug off add some here we go
Don<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.780> watch<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.260> liquid<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:59.210> fill

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
Don just watch them liquid into it fill

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.290 
Don just watch them liquid into it fill
it<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.510> water<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:02.460> might<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it with water you might have to do that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
it with water you might have to do that
three<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.750> four<00:01:03.780> times<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
three or four times where you got to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.410 
three or four times where you got to
feel<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.400> enough<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.170> put<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.420> plug

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
feel good enough and then put the plug

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.219 
feel good enough and then put the plug
back<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.340> let<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> set<00:01:11.900> probably<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.140> at

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
back in and let it set probably for at

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760 
back in and let it set probably for at
least<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.830> hour<00:01:14.310> three<00:01:15.119> hours<00:01:15.720> four<00:01:16.439> hours<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
least an hour three hours four hours of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
least an hour three hours four hours of
even<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> maximum<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> set<00:01:18.869> was

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
even that I think the maximum I set was

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.149 
even that I think the maximum I set was
maybe<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.470> hour<00:01:19.970> remember<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.159> drain

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
maybe an hour remember to put the drain

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.570 
maybe an hour remember to put the drain
plug<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.110> or<00:01:25.110> fill<00:01:25.950> plug<00:01:26.159> whatever<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
plug back in or fill plug whatever you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
plug back in or fill plug whatever you
want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> call<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:26.970> back<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> tighten<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
want to call it back in and tighten it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
want to call it back in and tighten it
before<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.700> try<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> start<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> pump

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
before you try to start the pump

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080 
before you try to start the pump
otherwise<00:01:31.650> you're<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.400> hell<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
otherwise you're gonna get one hell of a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
otherwise you're gonna get one hell of a
shower<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> I've<00:01:34.530> done<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.280> three

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
shower now I've done this about three

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.120 
shower now I've done this about three
times<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.530> worked

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
times and it worked

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
times and it worked
currently<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.000> go<00:01:39.420> ahead<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> show

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
currently right now go ahead and show

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.950 
currently right now go ahead and show
you<00:01:39.900> let<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.170> tell<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.530> down<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.570> just<00:01:42.570> put

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you let me tell you this down I just put

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.370 
you let me tell you this down I just put
some<00:01:43.220> dishwashing<00:01:44.220> liquid<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.380> little

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
some dishwashing liquid in it a little

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.850 
some dishwashing liquid in it a little
bit<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.649> water<00:01:47.030> probably<00:01:48.030> need<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.509> water

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
bit of water probably need more water

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.639 
bit of water probably need more water
but<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.520> try<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> kick<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> pump<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.659> listen

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
but if I try to kick the pump on listen

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.250 
but if I try to kick the pump on listen
to<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.600 

anybody<00:01:58.260> out<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.800> pump<00:01:59.040> knows<00:01:59.370> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
anybody out on the pump knows that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
anybody out on the pump knows that
humming<00:02:00.060> noise<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.630> motor<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.650> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
humming noise the motor is not going to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.120 
humming noise the motor is not going to
spin<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:04.080> out<00:02:04.230> let<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.440> sets<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.890> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
spin so I'm out let it sets a little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
spin so I'm out let it sets a little
while<00:02:05.310> I'll<00:02:05.670> come<00:02:05.850> back<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.480> refilm<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
while I'll come back out and refilm it
