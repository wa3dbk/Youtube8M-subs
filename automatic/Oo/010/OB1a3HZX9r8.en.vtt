00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
end right here is to blue hog or to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240 
end right here is to blue hog or to
spread<00:02:59.150> out<00:02:59.390> so<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.660> think<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.500> not<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.860> good

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
spread out so I think that is not a good

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.160 
spread out so I think that is not a good
thing<00:03:01.490> if<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:02.180> would<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.810> get<00:03:03.110> that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
thing if you would like to get that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.620 
thing if you would like to get that
really<00:03:03.650> sharp<00:03:03.920> edge<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.520> you'd<00:03:04.850> have<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.420> like

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
really sharp edge so you'd have to like

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.410 
really sharp edge so you'd have to like
run<00:03:06.170> your<00:03:06.440> finger<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.460> or<00:03:07.640> use<00:03:07.880> concealer

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
run your finger on here or use concealer

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.870 
run your finger on here or use concealer
to<00:03:08.750> get<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.290> really<00:03:09.530> sleek<00:03:09.950> look<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.760> then

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
to get that really sleek look but then

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.550 
to get that really sleek look but then
again<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.570> would<00:03:11.750> still<00:03:11.990> be<00:03:12.140> able<00:03:12.410> to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
again I think you would still be able to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.100 
again I think you would still be able to
use<00:03:12.770> this<00:03:13.190> brush<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.880> came<00:03:14.390> with<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.630> product

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
use this brush that came with a product

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.870 
use this brush that came with a product
the<00:03:15.350> packaging<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.010> fashioned<00:03:16.400> 21<00:03:16.760> I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
the packaging of the fashioned 21 I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.820 
the packaging of the fashioned 21 I
browse<00:03:17.120> dual<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.570> bit<00:03:17.870> flimsy<00:03:18.170> because<00:03:18.470> it's

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
browse dual is a bit flimsy because it's

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.160 
browse dual is a bit flimsy because it's
made<00:03:19.070> all<00:03:19.250> out<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.700> plastic<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.810> doesn't

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
made all out of plastic but that doesn't

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.380 
made all out of plastic but that doesn't
bother<00:03:21.350> me<00:03:21.500> at<00:03:21.770> all<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.850> think

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
bother me at all just because I think

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.520 
bother me at all just because I think
it's<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.810> good<00:03:23.990> product

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's a good product

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.830 
it's a good product
um<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:25.340> not<00:03:25.610> something<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.270> go<00:03:26.480> for

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
um it's not something that you go for

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810 
um it's not something that you go for
you<00:03:27.500> know<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.800> any<00:03:27.920> packaging<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.670> go

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
you know for any packaging but you go

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.430 
you know for any packaging but you go
for<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> product<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.630> itself<00:03:29.960> so<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.320> think

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
for the product in itself so I think

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.190 
for the product in itself so I think
this<00:03:31.160> fashion<00:03:31.580> 21<00:03:32.000> eyebrow<00:03:32.330> duo<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> good

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
this fashion 21 eyebrow duo is a good

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.560 
this fashion 21 eyebrow duo is a good
vibe<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.730> form<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
vibe as you can see the form and the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.900 
vibe as you can see the form and the
shape<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.840> my<00:03:36.050> brows<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.650> amazing<00:03:37.640> right<00:03:37.880> now

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
shape of my brows is amazing right now

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.390 
shape of my brows is amazing right now
and<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.510> think<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.930> um<00:03:39.170> brow<00:03:39.920> powder<00:03:40.190> would

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
and I think this um brow powder would

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.860 
and I think this um brow powder would
last<00:03:40.640> me<00:03:40.850> all<00:03:41.030> throughout<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.480> day<00:03:41.510> just

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
last me all throughout the day just

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.860 
last me all throughout the day just
because<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.470> used<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:43.160> together<00:03:43.520> with<00:03:43.790> water

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.470 

so<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.860> price<00:03:52.069> of<00:03:52.129> 150<00:03:52.879> I<00:03:52.910> think<00:03:53.300> this

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
so for the price of 150 I think this

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.900 
so for the price of 150 I think this
product<00:03:53.780> isn't<00:03:54.200> goodbye<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.860> highly<00:03:55.489> recommend
