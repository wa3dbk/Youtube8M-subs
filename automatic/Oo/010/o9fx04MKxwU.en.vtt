00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.460
 today look for one how are you five if you 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.889
 I bring a new epic battle between the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.260
 mutants this already know in the other 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.450
 battles that makes fighting this the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.240
 mutants as some people I 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.250
 they started to say that I fought against 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.900
 them not that I'm not a fag and that I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.939
 I fought against them not because they already know 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.680
 that I just saw and I stayed there 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.630
 from a distance watching how they fought between 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.490
 they did not and well I got a good idea 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.379
 I said good why do not I also enter 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.840
 to battle and fight against some of 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.180
 these mutants and maybe even a 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.980
 small series not among the mutants this 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.739
 that I fought against all of those in the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.260
 module then this depends what is 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.480
 support this video this will look like this 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.770
 I will continue fighting against for example this 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 battle you will find skeletons 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.520
 mutants and support maybe make more 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.590
 battles against the mutant zombie or 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.079
 against in the amount and so will not go 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.570
 rotating and well let's see how and what 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.489
 how can you notice that you see me and it 's water and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.270
 the sun is burning my eyes now 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.270
 same so I'm going to go down 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.280
 god looks very good these shaders this 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.110
 I just recorded the mold few tics in 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 which also used Chejter if you see 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.260
 that I'm not falling in love you see 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.970
 and it is knows it looks very good this 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.280
 let's see how you can let me down here 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.200
 a little bit to what is the render distance 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.300
 that the map is very large has many 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.000
 things and then if I understand the guide 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.650
 a little bit because I tell them the map 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.380
 It is very big and apart with the shaders 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 yes yes yes it is a bit difficult not for 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.700
 the computer then this one is also 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.290
 recording an HD and it is very difficult 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 so let's put this on just like that 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.850
 if it shows, let's put this again 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 during the day since not everything illuminated 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 this here is not going to see anything 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.910
 the shaders then let's go see 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740
 As you can see I have my team here 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.869
 to have full iron so I'm not going to 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.990
 use diamond I will be only full 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.270
 iron I'm going to use is also from a 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.979
 diamond sword two golden ones 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.380
 well just in case it's never too 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.410
 the evil is a little food in case 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.540
 torches come hungry in case 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.730
 It gets to be at night and it's a bit of 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.560
 sand not so it never comes bad 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.110
 sand let's take out the skeleton here 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 let's look for him maybe this is a 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.480
 awful fail maybe this battle wins 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.040
 I dont know 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 let's see how we 're doing this 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.590
 put normal and let's see today god of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.540
 they are getting nervous I'm 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
 getting nervous with this first 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
 battle I do not know how it's going to come out maybe 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.560
 be quick maybe it took a lot I do not know 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.400
 but good I'm going oh well let me get 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.900
 in survivor 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.810
 and well I'll put it and I'll go out 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.640
 running like a champion and good 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.180
 I'm going to put behind this one two 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.030
 three 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.650
 runs runs with rigor wing god no 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.560

 cole your sister do not keep me away hatred 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.110
 peaks you see when you jump in the air with 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.290
 the shaders u and good what up 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.799
 I can win with you already lower half of 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.739
 stop coming bastard or god or god oh 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.260
 God, look at me again, I can not 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.110
 give I think I missed taking a bow 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.819
 because it's so fucking close to me so 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.760
 but it's going through the pac that 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.220
 bullshit I'm behind is going down 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.260
 much 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.770
 my god my god come on life goes up 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.290
 life ok I'm going for you bastard because let me 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:46.100
 approaching applied from your sister because 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.100
 I'm going to kill him I'm going to kill you died 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.060
 the state of I killed him I do not know I think the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.580
 skeleton indeed the skeleton is not the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.100
 weakest of all the mods study 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.440
 someone who, for example, recalls 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.600
 three times the in they earn enough has 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.640
 200 of life then I think this is the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.290
 weaker then then I think I'm going to 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.840
 go like this I will not go from weaker to more 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.340
 strong is here we have your head let's go 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.050
 to grab his head I'm going to put 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.350
 As a trophy, see this, I have a head 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.060
 mutant zombie of him well I do not know 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.739
 how long this video lasted I think it covers a 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.480
 little indeed the battle lasted very little 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.130
 I wanted it to be a bit more but 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.040
 well this is a simple test and then 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.510
 tell you what you think is not this 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.370
 please support if you want some new 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.080
 obviously battle the other battles 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.910
 they will be longer with the mods 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.410
 they are stronger I tell them that the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.780
 skeleton is not the weakest then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.370
 the others are going to be longer then 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.270
 please support if they came to this 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.640
 part comment skeleton 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.990
 that they can put the gay skeleton on 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.790
 to write so gay if they came to this 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.460
 part and well I'm going to have this here 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.280
 so I hope you enjoyed watching the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.490
 final what beautiful final see see this be 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.880
 to see how light enters through 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.470
 the windows is that it looks really good for 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.460
 that they see how it is seen they take us like 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.290
 go night night see light turn on 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.210
 and I do not know how much it looks like 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.300
 done I have many patches of textures 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.880
 this enough but I'm thinking about doing 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.160
 a video of textures especially of 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.980
 shaders or textures what stupid is 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.290
 they call shaders shaders packs then 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.850
 because after that it no longer a 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.980
 so you can see let's put this 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.360
 so this so that you can see how to say that 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.360
 he is drunk and drugged 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.350
 Well then I'll end this here and 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.060
 here in this with this one 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.240
 these checks that make you feel that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.539
 are you drunk leave me 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:51.020
 so in the air put this a bit 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:53.630
 farther this is life and how good it is 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.139
 see this well then now with this 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.090
 beautiful this country this beautiful landscape I'm going 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.580
 to finish this so I hope there will be 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.580
 liked and see you until next time
