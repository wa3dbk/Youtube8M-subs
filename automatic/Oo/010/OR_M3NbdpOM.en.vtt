with<00:00:53.190> those<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:55.340> what<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> say<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.859> about

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with those and what can I say and about

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.299 
with those and what can I say and about
those<00:01:00.410> basically<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> didn't<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
those basically what I didn't like that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.429 
those basically what I didn't like that
they<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.120> Greece<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.199> can't

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they don't have from Greece you can't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.480 
they don't have from Greece you can't
keep<00:01:04.589> avoiding<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.150> should<00:01:06.390> be

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
keep avoiding of them so that should be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.530 
keep avoiding of them so that should be
producing<00:01:08.490> should<00:01:08.729> provide<00:01:09.060> em<00:01:09.330> basically

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
producing should provide em basically

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:21.510 
producing should provide em basically
well<00:01:10.080> unfortunately<00:01:10.860> later<00:01:11.430> on

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:51.790 

so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:26.059 

so<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:52.830> can<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.250> quite<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.750> more<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:54.900> inflation

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.369 

bitch

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.600

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
as you can see they are all really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.509 
as you can see they are all really
powerful<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.750> some<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.830> them<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.160> really

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
powerful so and some of them is really

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.900 
powerful so and some of them is really
