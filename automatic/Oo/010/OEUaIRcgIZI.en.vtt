00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.060 
bits and pieces the whole first section
is<00:01:20.000> based<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> pentatonic<00:01:21.020> pattern<00:01:21.350> that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
is based on a pentatonic pattern that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.770 
is based on a pentatonic pattern that
goes<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:22.460> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.930 

and<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.080> skip<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.770> D<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> B<00:01:30.780> strings<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
and we skip the D and the B strings and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.490 
and we skip the D and the B strings and
add<00:01:32.940> note<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.780> our<00:01:33.810> middle<00:01:34.650> finger

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.249 

until<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> part<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> slide<00:01:41.969> up

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.840 
then you add an f-sharp to the mix width
which<00:01:45.990> gives<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.469> light<00:01:46.799> nice<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.490> modern
