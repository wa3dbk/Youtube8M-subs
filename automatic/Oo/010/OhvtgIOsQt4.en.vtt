00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that when you look at the legs of a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
that when you look at the legs of a
glass<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.930> alcohol

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
glass it actually is just the alcohol

and<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> water<00:00:40.980> evaporating<00:00:41.910> from<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> side

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and the water evaporating from the side

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
and the water evaporating from the side
of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> glass<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.469> doesn't<00:00:43.770> mean

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of the glass it really doesn't mean

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.240
