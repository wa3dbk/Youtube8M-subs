at some of the features on this skate

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.759 
at some of the features on this skate
starting<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.390> bottom<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.380> same

starting at the bottom you have the same
high-grade<00:00:26.429> performance<00:00:27.119> runner<00:00:27.419> that<00:00:27.539> you

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
high-grade performance runner that you

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.569 
high-grade performance runner that you
saw<00:00:27.749> on<00:00:28.050> previous<00:00:28.529> models<00:00:28.679> it<00:00:29.070> has<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
saw on previous models it has the

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.980 
saw on previous models it has the
scalloped<00:00:29.999> blade<00:00:30.240> design<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:30.900> going

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
scalloped blade design so that's going

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
scalloped blade design so that's going
to<00:00:31.050> save<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.499> weight<00:00:31.829> as<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.610> allowing

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to save some weight as well as allowing

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 
to save some weight as well as allowing
it<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> flex<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.470> same<00:00:34.860> Pro<00:00:35.700> II

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it to flex you have that same Pro II

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
it to flex you have that same Pro II
holder<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> offer<00:00:37.380> some

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
holder and so that's going to offer some

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.800 
holder and so that's going to offer some
good<00:00:37.770> performance<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.910> also<00:00:39.150> going<00:00:39.480> on

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
good performance and then also going on

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.960 
good performance and then also going on
to<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> outsole<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.830> guy<00:00:41.010> they're<00:00:41.460> using<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
to the outsole this guy they're using a

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.610 
to the outsole this guy they're using a
carbon<00:00:42.300> composite<00:00:42.960> outsole<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.530> going

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
carbon composite outsole so that's going

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.320 
carbon composite outsole so that's going
to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.830> great<00:00:44.220> lightweight<00:00:44.610> feel<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.150> well

to be a great lightweight feel as well

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.090 
to be a great lightweight feel as well
as<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.990> really<00:00:46.230> rigid<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
as being really rigid so it's going to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800 
as being really rigid so it's going to
offer<00:00:47.250> great<00:00:47.640> energy<00:00:48.210> transfer<00:00:48.600> from<00:00:48.660> your

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
offer great energy transfer from your

the<00:01:28.439> weight<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.789> Reeboks<00:01:29.789> done<00:01:29.969> a<00:01:30.030> really

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
the weight down Reeboks done a really

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.370 
the weight down Reeboks done a really
good<00:01:30.420> job<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.810> making<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.109> a<00:01:31.170> nice

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
good job at making this a nice

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.169 
good job at making this a nice
lightweight<00:01:31.740> skate<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.520> you'd<00:01:32.700> expect<00:01:33.090> from

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
lightweight skate as you'd expect from

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.969 
lightweight skate as you'd expect from
their<00:01:33.359> top-of-the-line<00:01:33.619> as<00:01:34.619> far<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.859> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
their top-of-the-line as far as the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
their top-of-the-line as far as the
support<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.609> it<00:01:35.719> I'd<00:01:36.719> say<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.020> might<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
support on it I'd say it might be a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
support on it I'd say it might be a
little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.979> softer<00:01:38.490> than<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.999> the<00:01:39.060> other

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little bit softer than some of the other

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.300 
little bit softer than some of the other
top-of-the-line<00:01:39.749> skates<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.920> will<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
top-of-the-line skates it will have a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.919 
top-of-the-line skates it will have a
nice<00:01:41.520> ankle<00:01:41.999> wrap<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.539> so<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.749> going<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
nice ankle wrap to it so it's going to

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.209 
nice ankle wrap to it so it's going to
offer<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.380> fit<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.889> not<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.100> be

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
offer a good fit but it's not gonna be

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.980 
offer a good fit but it's not gonna be
quite<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.700> stiff<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.299> some<00:01:45.719> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> other

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
quite as stiff as some of the other

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.959 
quite as stiff as some of the other
skates<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.829> now<00:01:46.859> I'm<00:01:47.759> spinning

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
of the backside and then also another

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
of the backside and then also another
nice<00:01:51.899> feature<00:01:52.109> about<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.679> is<00:01:52.859> I'm<00:01:53.100> sure<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
nice feature about that is I'm sure you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.770 
nice feature about that is I'm sure you
guys<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.639> familiar<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> pump<00:01:54.539> feature

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
guys are familiar with the pump feature

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
guys are familiar with the pump feature
on<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.049> they've<00:01:55.530> kept<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.520> have

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
on it they've kept with it they have

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
on it they've kept with it they have
redesigned<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.450> overall<00:01:57.929> pump<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.590> bit

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
redesigned the overall pump a little bit

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.859 
redesigned the overall pump a little bit
as<00:01:58.889> well<00:01:59.069> as<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.249> release<00:01:59.549> valve<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
as well as the release valve so it's a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
as well as the release valve so it's a
little<00:02:00.990> sleeker<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.979> closer<00:02:02.429> into<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
little sleeker a little closer into the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.149 
little sleeker a little closer into the
skate<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:04.109> as<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.319> does<00:02:04.499> do<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.679> good<00:02:04.770> job

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
skate as well as it does do a good job

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.830 
skate as well as it does do a good job
at<00:02:05.340> being<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.939> bit<00:02:06.060> wider<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.719> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
at being a little bit wider here so it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.570 
at being a little bit wider here so it's
a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:06.959> easier<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.499> pump<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
a little easier to pump and then the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.160 
a little easier to pump and then the
same<00:02:08.819> thing<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.209> far<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.630> other<00:02:09.810> side<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
same thing as far as the other side of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.020 
same thing as far as the other side of
the<00:02:10.229> release<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> almost<00:02:11.430> flush<00:02:11.760> with

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the release this is almost flush with

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
the release this is almost flush with
the<00:02:12.120> skate<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.629> they've<00:02:13.019> also<00:02:13.200> made<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the skate and they've also made this a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140 
the skate and they've also made this a
little<00:02:13.860> bit<00:02:14.069> bigger<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.640> don't<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
little bit bigger so you don't have to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.399 
little bit bigger so you don't have to
kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.450> push<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.659> in<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:16.049> fingernail

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
kind of push it in with your fingernail

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.750 
kind of push it in with your fingernail
you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.769> use<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:16.950> whole<00:02:17.159> finger

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you can just use your whole finger

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
you can just use your whole finger
and<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.120> offers<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.450> nice<00:02:18.629> release<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.290> so

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and it offers a nice release of that so

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
and it offers a nice release of that so
that's<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> nice<00:02:19.800> feature<00:02:19.830> always<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.610> on

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
moving down the laces a little bit it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020 
moving down the laces a little bit it
does<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.169> segments<00:03:34.739> right<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.910> that's

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
does have segments right here so that's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030 
does have segments right here so that's
gonna<00:03:36.120> allow<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.540> flex<00:03:37.019> forward<00:03:37.349> but<00:03:37.889> it's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
gonna allow it to flex forward but it's

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.839 
gonna allow it to flex forward but it's
still<00:03:38.130> gonna<00:03:38.310> offer<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.669> protection
