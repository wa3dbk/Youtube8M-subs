00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.070
 to all the guys with this new video 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.779
 we are here with our scoop builder 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.329
 how the g3 to the title is a premiere is 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.939
 a low cost premiere that's why 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.050
 because in any case it is the teams to do that 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.029
 nobody can afford it 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.219
 according to me it doesn't make sense then what it is 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.439
 the fact was thought to resume the 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.899
 lodging of last year where we did the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.910
 teams are that cost for me from pau to 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.280
 place that she pulls over for me 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.930
 million now cost even 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.820
 millions of tons said to do so 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.770
 let's do a first low cost tour 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.710
 thin on all the excused leagues below 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.930
 Microphone data and then we'll do a second 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.810
 ride on i for me ko when prices 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.010
 they will be affordable we talk about low cost 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.710
 so let's look at what they must not overcome 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.710
 the 70 80 100 thousand credits so let's talk 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 Up to 50 goes down because of 50,000 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 You will certainly have nature credits 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.590
 so let's start right away because you know not 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 it must last more than five minutes because 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.939
 if not, don't look at it, not because 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.460
 however it is much more usable more 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.380
 short is more immediately more usable 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.909
 I only remind you to go a page 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.439
 google plus and let go of facebook 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.170
 I will remember it for now 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.909
 for who knows how much we know it matters 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.649
 chosen hard cock john ribbon art 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.619
 hurt because why boys i have it 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.420
 used I had against is a monster 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.999
 there are situations in which he takes gods 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.999
 balloons that you ask but what the fuck does 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.709
 and how do you get them there gives you 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.319
 really on my nerves as a goalkeeper then 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.880
 of course you put the tactic of 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.429
 the goalkeeper and a pain in the ass 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 such an adversarial person makes a mistake in iorism 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.799
 minuscule a player with hips 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.359
 for what it costs arrive up to 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.219
 some discount from right to left 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.219
 in defense we have johnson 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:57.909
 we have so rolli thigh we head 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.049
 very strange 3 out of 4 are French then 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.780
 go to the liga not found 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.970
 a bullshit you do because why they cost 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 little are very strong players are in 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 some anomalous kabul type cases because 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.870
 They are really strong from what 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.190
 delivered to the midfield we go from below 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.129
 towards above I chose fellaini 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.180
 then I chose right and good valentia 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.000
 but here you guys can also put 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.760
 well according to how you like it 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.209
 on the other side from Arabs here it is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.200
 obligatory unfortunately it is in front of kagawa 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.390
 because I chose these players 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 1 because valentia is one for what 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 also in this case it is a tub 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.660
 eni file is one of the few in that role 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.360
 which certainly offers you defense e 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.040
 Mandatory calibrated attack is a choice 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.680
 required for this type of form with 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.599
 the externals if you obviously put the vco 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.549
 you have other choices 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.349
 however both a player and not 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.140
 sorry that i tried maybe a couple of 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.519
 matches is good but without being 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.099
 phenomenal ok let's put it this way it's not him 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.220
 on what militates tagawa boys 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.709
 is the discovery of this cat was already 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.720
 strong last year but this year 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.569
 I think it's a master's degree in all of his 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.310
 of premier who really denounce us 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.829
 because you don't have so many head preaching vi 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.519
 it offers so much that of the trills 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.319
 guys pick do do things that 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.239
 not even maradona of the times I will succeed 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.150
 veil you have to try it if you don't 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.380
 believe you bought so cheap 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.410
 sorry guys I tried to understand 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.400
 everyone in front of me chose a couple 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.250
 heavy haedo with 100 heavy copies 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.290
 negredo benteke or benteke depends on how 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.889
 you want to call it state he says 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.889
 also bengt ake 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.400
 very heavy attackers in the sense that 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.070
 190 of strength and the other 85 86 na stuff 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.950
 really absurd, but it is a niggle 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.190
 an animal and shot pulled from outside with 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.140
 decree boys and is a beast and bent 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.620
 which is the opposite is very fast and it is 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.620
 strong of head 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
 obviously I put two externals in it 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.050
 one of the two external f fast that i 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.730
 obvious and very fast so put on 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.340
 the attacker as much as you want 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.520
 hit your head from the opposite side 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.990
 compared to the outside you want 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.710
 because the outside when it comes to the cross 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.410
 usually it was rome it tends to 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.970
 putting it on the second pole does not admit 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.100
 never on the first and if you put them like this 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.050
 usually go straight for straight or yes 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.820
 centralize so 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.290
 so guys what you want that 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.870
 hit ss on the opposite side 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.730
 of the outside it is a team that costs 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.160
 I miss 30,000 kids credits in my opinion 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.650
 it's great I'll just do it really 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.169
 as soon as I have to contest the first half 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.940
 credits that surely gain them 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.669
 I spend on a team of this kind 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.919
 I hope you enjoyed a team 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.690
 I think that is worth to try it 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.480
 a team with a number with which it is 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.820
 quite low so it also lends itself 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.860
 not to be taken as a tip 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.120
 from the great squadrons that you are 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.770
 let's say that between division 10 a 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.630
 division iii you can safely 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.640
 according to me go ahead since the canvas 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.130
 modify by finding an external 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.370
 worth left is a cdm in 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.560
 this case a cdc which obviously rega 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.900
 more perhaps of defensive weight 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.000
 of the team avoiding i 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.350
 two central boys write visa of 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.180
 all writes followed we breached in 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.610
 almost twenty seconds before tax I had in 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.770
 mind 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.879
 it is nothing else I thank you that remains 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.879
 we were there bye bye
