00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.450
 ah ah 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 he says 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.650
 what 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.629
 Pont-Ã -Monsson deserves its victory 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.129
 I wish them good luck 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.800
 next week to ride in third 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.879
 young division and beautiful team a good 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.410
 we are in our place 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.709
 good here today we took our 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.640
 suitcases it's like that continues at home 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.900
 we took the match by the good end 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.069
 especially because it's good 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.510
 a team that plays a team that is 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.550
 still not bad it's a team that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.280
 is super interesting and here they are 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.110
 still product of the game and and that's it and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.060
 so we took a very, very 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.080
 seriously and we respected the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.370
 instructions it was really important and 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.910
 finally we could not be afraid today 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.530
 it's impossible 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.519
 here we could not lose it and by 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.989
 relation to the world that had compared 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.540
 at all the work that has been done any 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.680
 the season and I had only one little 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.239
 see well they do not even score a 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.230
 try ben me I've always been taught 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.400
 that's what I explained to the players 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.709
 you always taught me when we meet 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.220
 an opponent on the game at 100% from the beginning 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.840
 until the end 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.910
 so we played them from beginning to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.260
 end at 100% because we do not respect 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.360
 all the teams that they show 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.180
 they go down and so 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.769
 next year we will see the year 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.450
 next for the store celebrated this 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.709
 year there is a championship of France they 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.630
 shield of alsace-lorraine also go 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.130
 so look there today we do the 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.200
 climb then we'll see next year 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.250
 a little later but she is getting ready 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 here she is preparing well 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.709
 Bajeux several clubs including Lorraine 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.880
 I played in several small clubs 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.519
 but it's still monsoon that it has 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.319
 started to be super interesting since 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.150
 waves the hand I got there 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 do not serve hand to 13 years and that's it 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.319
 so I did my mini course and 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.870
 junior cadets and then I arrive 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.180
 in seniors and we found a great 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.069
 group of young and then old the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.130
 mix at my well super market well that 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.710
 it gives 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.150
 it really gives a really good 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.100
 thing for to continue afterwards 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.210
 and then to improve in federal 3 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.250
 now could fear a little 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.790
 maybe it does a little bit of the end of 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.140
 season and then the 2 to be too easy 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.370
 gired health but I think the 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.870
 players wanted to have fun too 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.640
 and then please all 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.320
 supporters who were present and that's 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.610
 true that from this point of view there I think 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.490
 that the day is full and whole 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.930
 so now they seem to be asking 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.600
 actually play at a level a 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.210
 little higher so so csq is well no 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.290
 but it's clear that it's true that 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.550
 in our regions it's a bit more 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.520
 difficult than in others but hey 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.230
 will try to prepare at least for 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.180
 have a nice season and then in 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.890
 hoping that the psychiatrist maintain because 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.620
 it is true that today the committee of 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.660
 Lorraine still has enough twice 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.610
 pretending to stay in federal I will go to 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.400
 several clubs and was there so 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.940
 good i hope for your monsoon will do 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.940
 part of that
