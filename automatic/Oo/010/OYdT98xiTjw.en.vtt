out to the equation how do you take
Southern<00:03:18.780> Cal<00:03:18.900> equation<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
Southern Cal equation are you know to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250 
Southern Cal equation are you know to
say<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> hypothetical<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.050> okay

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
say a hypothetical you know it okay

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.410 
say a hypothetical you know it okay
hypothetical<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.340> him<00:03:23.459> happy<00:03:23.819> we'll<00:03:24.239> put

James<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.340> me<00:03:32.489> hard<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.000> year<00:03:33.060> team<00:03:33.330> is

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
James so me hard this year team is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.780 
James so me hard this year team is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
distracted told the wrong thing going on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.759 
distracted told the wrong thing going on
so<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.450> feel<00:03:36.690> that's<00:03:36.959> why<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.170> said<00:03:37.290> something

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
so I feel that's why I said something

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.620 
so I feel that's why I said something
then<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.459> hit<00:03:38.670> that's<00:03:39.000> why<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> take<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.420> lot<00:03:39.569> of

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
then you hit that's why I take a lot of

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.539 
then you hit that's why I take a lot of
equations<00:03:40.019> obviously<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.440> say<00:03:40.530> itself<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:40.950> in

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
equations obviously and say itself is in

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.100 
equations obviously and say itself is in
that<00:03:41.819> sign<00:03:42.090> because<00:03:42.269> my<00:03:42.390> dad<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.900> do
