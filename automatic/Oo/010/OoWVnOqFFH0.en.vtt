grilling next you want to always lift
the<00:00:39.050> lid<00:00:39.260> before<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.860> light<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.280> grill<00:00:40.399> this

the lid before you light the grill this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.639 
the lid before you light the grill this

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
is very important because if there's any

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.889 
is very important because if there's any
excess<00:00:43.219> gas<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.300> don't<00:00:44.480> want<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.780> get

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
trapped under the grill because you want

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.729 
trapped under the grill because you want
it<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.149> go<00:00:47.269> out<00:00:47.449> into<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.929> atmosphere<00:00:48.050> and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
it to go out into the atmosphere and

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.680 
it to go out into the atmosphere and
then<00:00:48.980> as<00:00:49.129> soon<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.429> you<00:00:49.550> light<00:00:49.789> it<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.390> want<00:00:50.570> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
then as soon as you light it you want to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.389 
then as soon as you light it you want to
make<00:00:50.809> sure<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.589> close<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.100> lid<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.309> your

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
grill so that it can preheat there are a

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.079 
grill so that it can preheat there are a
couple<00:00:54.679> of<00:00:54.920> tools<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:55.489> want<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.760> have<00:00:55.909> on

hand number one a fire extinguisher this
is<00:00:59.570> very<00:00:59.749> important<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.409> on<00:01:00.589> hand<00:01:00.620> but

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
is very important to have on hand but

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.549 
is very important to have on hand but
hopefully<00:01:01.579> you'll<00:01:01.699> never<00:01:01.760> have<00:01:01.999> to<00:01:02.179> use<00:01:02.359> it

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
hopefully you'll never have to use it

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.320 
hopefully you'll never have to use it
another<00:01:03.559> nice<00:01:03.829> thing<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:04.370> have<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.550> hand<00:01:04.760> is

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
another nice thing to have on hand is

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.780 
another nice thing to have on hand is
kosher<00:01:05.690> salt<00:01:06.140> we've<00:01:06.890> all<00:01:07.130> had<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.400> flare-up

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
kosher salt we've all had a flare-up

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.510 
kosher salt we've all had a flare-up
from<00:01:07.940> time<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.630> time<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.920> quickest<00:01:10.370> and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
from time to time and the quickest and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.340 
from time to time and the quickest and
easiest<00:01:10.700> way<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.210> extinguish<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:11.900> flare-up

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
easiest way to extinguish that flare-up

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.500 
easiest way to extinguish that flare-up
is<00:01:12.590> by<00:01:13.070> making<00:01:13.250> sure<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.820> lid<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.150> your<00:01:14.180> grill

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
is by making sure the lid of your grill

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.810 
is by making sure the lid of your grill
is<00:01:14.750> closed<00:01:15.230> thereby<00:01:15.950> getting<00:01:16.460> rid<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.730> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
is closed thereby getting rid of the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
is closed thereby getting rid of the
oxygen<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.660> hopefully<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.500> flare<00:01:18.740> up<00:01:18.860> will

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
oxygen and hopefully the flare up will

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.400 
oxygen and hopefully the flare up will
actually<00:01:19.360> extinguish<00:01:20.360> itself<00:01:20.720> if<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.290> have<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
actually extinguish itself if you have a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.140 
actually extinguish itself if you have a
little<00:01:21.680> bit<00:01:21.860> more<00:01:22.070> than<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.400> small<00:01:22.670> flare<00:01:23.000> up

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
little bit more than a small flare up

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.600 
little bit more than a small flare up
you<00:01:23.330> might<00:01:23.510> use<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.080> kosher<00:01:24.440> salt<00:01:24.680> all<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.460> do
