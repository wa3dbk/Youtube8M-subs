00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
cards running like 85 degrees I don't

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.740 
cards running like 85 degrees I don't
care<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.470> long<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.979> stable<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.850> its<00:01:36.450> if

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.510 
opinion on this card compared to the 580
remember<00:01:46.200> almost<00:01:46.470> saving<00:01:46.890> two<00:01:47.250> hundred

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
remember almost saving two hundred

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
remember almost saving two hundred
dollars<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.909> almost<00:01:48.090> half<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> price<00:01:48.899> pretty

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
dollars is almost half the price pretty

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
dollars is almost half the price pretty
much<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.799> half<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.040> price<00:01:50.540> what<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
much is half the price what would you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
much is half the price what would you
what<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.640> stutter

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
