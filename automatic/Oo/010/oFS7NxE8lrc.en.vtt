00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:11.190
 Yes began to shepherd the Hello recently hamster 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 On is it Summer unpleasant today method of mounting the custom iem that the request was there 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 Would you like to shoot an introductory video m 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.030
 Do you have a customer m is a custom in-ear monitor 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.390
 Be it artist is over 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:31.120
 age You 're listening to me 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.980
 If you purchased this for listening to music listen to this music 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.590
 If compared to the also two areas that are removed dipped even arrived do not know a little well-ordered 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.020
 It is a video for those who are hard 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.230
 Yes custom iem like this ear that ear 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:51.640
 Make according to the shape 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.770
 Because it is a custom- made earphone, if the shape is this, I will be in the state of being matched to the shape of the ear 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 I am 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.740
 The image when putting it in and out 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.210
 news 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:08.080
 So I really want to put the customer edge of my hand on my finger 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:14.500
 In easy to understand I will go in the left ear 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 This is the fit ear mh 334 for the left ear 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.730
 Is the blue of the shell want public but you put here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 I in Masu with putt now 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.040
 Hmm 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.030
 Yes 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.049
 It is early when used 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.840
 It is first if it is said how to put it on 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:37.180
 Part of the shell 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:41.210
 With a little of the state, such as inclined this way before mounting state 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:51.490
 And decided to angle it will come to see the cable before 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:54.579
 Rotate the Ushironfi while pushing the tip from the state in which tilted before this 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.790
 It is a little clockwise as seen from everyone 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.980
 High 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.370
 It enters when pushed in while rotating high 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.380
 Though this is the right case 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:10.679
 Multiply this I am here is the same mini-game road ahead 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.569
 This while putting the tip of the shell into the ear 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:21.860
 It's backwards, I'm putting it backwards . 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:25.020
 I think that it will be counterclockwise as seen from you this time because it is the reverse of this time 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.420
 I understand this is now in 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.290
 It's like this and this is already well in front of the cable 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.980
 I think there are a lot of people actually 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.440
 That's the original cable is that 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 To tell the truth behind 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.349
 Turn and put 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.150
 Yes cable splashes 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.090
 Hey 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.940
 It's behind me now 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.180
 And I want to say how to do this 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.879
 I squeeze 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:07.019
 If you do yes, you will not be able to see the cable completely from the front 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:11.400
 This cable often passes that artist to this of the jacket 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.209
 In view only all sound so has led to either the receiver and what are you went to such Fu 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.569
 Though 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.270
 When the presence of the cable there is a scene, such as work well that way place your hand does not look much 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 I'm coming at this cable 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.640
 Because 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:33.840
 If you sing while dancing, you can see the cable floating around here for a moment 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 It is a mistake if you will but often is actually to a large Zengcheng of this Iyamoni Once 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:44.130
 Is said to better our chair of the cable is also better to use and on the move and this in 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.030
 You can hear the 4 generated by the vibration of the cable to your ear , so you can prevent this. 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.150
 In fact 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.960
 Because it is more azimuthal than you use in listening 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.740
 Cable may be a bit short, maybe it's an e 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.470
 That im another one im custom i have 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.040
 It is a temptation ultimate A head nice Yui 18 It is also this 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.510
 Since that Tsukekata basically the same 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.030
 before 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.000
 I receive a catan 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.920
 so 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.450
 e 0 while back 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.050
 e 0 gala over over 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.260
 Masu behind 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.130
 We arrived and yes you to 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.310
 Not enter ordinary earphone only the second was meandering put straight 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.510
 I need a little rotation, so before removing it together 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.680
 The carter is ok too 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.639
 Naha bus and yes 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:39.280
 I feel like this I need some tips, but it's too early to get used to 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.280
 Please try this how to remove it
