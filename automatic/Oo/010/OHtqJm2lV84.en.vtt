00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.120 
Smoove that across and then for the bar
for<00:02:59.840> what<00:03:00.170> we'll<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.500> we'll<00:03:00.620> delete<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
for what we'll do is we'll delete it the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.020 
for what we'll do is we'll delete it the
first<00:03:01.400> part<00:03:01.670> again<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.209> we'll<00:03:02.390> take<00:03:02.569> right<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
first part again so we'll take right the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.349 
first part again so we'll take right the
to<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.269> kicks<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:12.910> we'll<00:03:13.910> take<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.209> the

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
to get the kicks and we'll take out the

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.220 
to get the kicks and we'll take out the
tambourines<00:03:15.049> will<00:03:15.380> take<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.799> huts<00:03:16.069> and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
tambourines will take out the huts and

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:30.090 
tambourines will take out the huts and
the<00:03:18.230> clubs<00:03:18.470> on<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.829> snare

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.650 

and<00:03:31.100> then<00:03:31.670> we<00:03:31.760> could<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.060> duplicate<00:03:32.540> that

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
and then we could just duplicate that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.050 
and then we could just duplicate that
across<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:33.860> alt<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.490> click<00:03:34.520> these

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
across so we can alt and click these

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.750 
across so we can alt and click these
four<00:03:35.480> across<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.490> that<00:03:37.490> will<00:03:37.580> duplicate

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
four across and that will duplicate

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.800 
four across and that will duplicate
across<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.600> art<00:03:38.810> bar<00:03:39.140> 16<00:03:40.300> will<00:03:41.300> minimize<00:03:41.690> that

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
across the art bar 16 will minimize that

00:03:41.810 --> 00:04:02.050 
across the art bar 16 will minimize that
grip<00:03:42.020> now<00:03:43.540> publish<00:03:44.540> this

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.430 

still<00:04:03.060> got<00:04:03.180> our<00:04:03.300> open<00:04:03.720> hop<00:04:03.900> playing<00:04:04.170> across

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
still got our open hop playing across

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.840 
still got our open hop playing across
them<00:04:04.710> is<00:04:04.860> going<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.010> go<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.340> delete<00:04:05.400> that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.820 

didn't<00:04:08.850> realize<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.660> delete<00:04:09.900> their<00:04:10.170> sleep

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
didn't realize we can delete their sleep

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
didn't realize we can delete their sleep
there<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.770> also<00:04:22.920> delete<00:04:23.280> there<00:04:23.550> without

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
there you can also delete there without

00:04:23.850 --> 00:05:10.670 
there you can also delete there without
white<00:04:24.060> noise<00:04:24.210> hits

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.350 

okay<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:11.800> that's<00:05:12.100> sounds<00:05:12.280> great<00:05:12.340> there<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:13.060> we

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
okay so that's sounds great there and we

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.080 
okay so that's sounds great there and we
can<00:05:13.480> minimize<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:15.840> then<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.050> we<00:05:17.200> just

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
can minimize this and then if we just

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.270 
can minimize this and then if we just
see<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.240> project<00:05:19.860> okay<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:20.950> in<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.190> next

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
see this project okay so in the next

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.500 
see this project okay so in the next
tutorial<00:05:21.460> we're<00:05:21.790> going<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:22.000> bring<00:05:22.150> in<00:05:22.300> another

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
tutorial we're going to bring in another

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.270 
tutorial we're going to bring in another
based<00:05:22.750> part<00:05:23.050> just<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.680> fill<00:05:23.890> in<00:05:24.010> some<00:05:24.160> more

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
based part just to fill in some more

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.490 
based part just to fill in some more
gaps
