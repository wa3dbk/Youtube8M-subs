00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
can see this connector right here which

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.149 
can see this connector right here which
feeds<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:43.009> feeds<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> video<00:01:44.549> boards<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.950> x

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
set it feeds the y-sustain here so I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.999 
set it feeds the y-sustain here so I'm
going<00:01:59.100> to<00:02:00.860> unplug<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:04.200> connector<00:02:04.259> right

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
going to unplug this connector right

going to unplug this connector right
here<00:02:05.070> from<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> power<00:02:06.000> supply<00:02:06.500> which<00:02:07.500> will

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
here from the power supply which will

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.690 
here from the power supply which will
disconnect<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.660> both<00:02:09.660> X&amp;Y<00:02:10.619> sustain<00:02:11.310> boards

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
disconnect the both X&amp;Y sustain boards

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.070 
disconnect the both X&amp;Y sustain boards
from<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> power<00:02:12.270> supply

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
from the power supply

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.060 
from the power supply
and<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> plug<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.950> back<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
and I'm going to plug it back in and

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.340 
and I'm going to plug it back in and
guess<00:02:18.070> what<00:02:19.230> power<00:02:20.230> supply<00:02:20.530> comes<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
guess what power supply comes on the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.990 
guess what power supply comes on the
green<00:02:23.590> light<00:02:23.800> comes<00:02:24.070> on<00:02:24.250> stable

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
green light comes on stable

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.810 
green light comes on stable
you<00:02:25.510> heard<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> Tweedledee<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:27.280> machine<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
you heard the Tweedledee the machine is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.760 
you heard the Tweedledee the machine is
up<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> ready<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.630> go<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.200> had<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.350> signal

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
up and ready to go if we had a signal

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.920 
up and ready to go if we had a signal
connected<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.940> would<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.330> producing<00:02:31.870> a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
connected it would be producing a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.770 
connected it would be producing a
picture<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.970> would<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.330> attempting<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
picture or it would be attempting to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740 
picture or it would be attempting to
produce<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.140> picture<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.630> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
produce a picture so this is that this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.870 
produce a picture so this is that this
is<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.900> short<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.830> either<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.670> board<00:02:40.980> or<00:02:41.980> this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
is a short on either this board or this

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
is a short on either this board or this
board<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.700> we're<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:47.190> unplug<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
board so now we're going to unplug the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.390 
board so now we're going to unplug the
set<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> power<00:02:49.090> again<00:02:50.010> we're<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> plug

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
set the power again we're going to plug

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.710 
set the power again we're going to plug

to unplug this connector which feeds the
I<00:03:01.260> believe<00:03:02.260> it's<00:03:02.440> called<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.810> y-sustain

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
I believe it's called the y-sustain

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.880 
I believe it's called the y-sustain
board<00:03:08.160> we're<00:03:09.160> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> plug<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.640> back<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:10.090> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.500 

we<00:03:14.890> now<00:03:15.070> get<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.730> same<00:03:17.880> correct<00:03:18.880> symptom<00:03:19.330> you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
we now get the same correct symptom you

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.020 
we now get the same correct symptom you
heard<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> thing<00:03:20.200> sign<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.820> light

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
heard the thing sign on the light

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.860 
heard the thing sign on the light
remains<00:03:23.019> on<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:24.970> says<00:03:25.239> there's<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.570> Fault

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
remains on so this says there's a Fault

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.060 
remains on so this says there's a Fault
in<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:27.459> board<00:03:27.760> over<00:03:27.910> here<00:03:28.650> now<00:03:29.650> I'm<00:03:29.769> going<00:03:30.010> to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
in this board over here now I'm going to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.250 
in this board over here now I'm going to
order<00:03:30.220> one<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.670> we'll<00:03:30.790> try<00:03:31.060> replacing<00:03:31.360> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.410 

and<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.010> folks<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.730> can<00:03:39.940> see<00:03:41.010> after<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.420> have

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.500 
and so folks you can see after we have
replaced<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.440> board<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:49.060> now<00:03:49.240> have<00:03:49.480> a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
replaced the board that we now have a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.850 
replaced the board that we now have a
working<00:03:50.100> color<00:03:51.100> television<00:03:51.730> once<00:03:51.940> again<00:03:52.860> so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
working color television once again so

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.640

that's the end of this video remember to
check<00:03:56.830> for<00:03:57.010> shorted<00:03:57.430> boards<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:58.080> plasma<00:03:59.080> TVs

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
check for shorted boards in plasma TVs

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.620 
check for shorted boards in plasma TVs
it's<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.310> simple<00:04:00.670> fix<00:04:00.990> thank<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.320> good<00:04:02.440> day
