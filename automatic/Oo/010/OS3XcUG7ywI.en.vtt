I didn't cover the holes because I'm
going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.220> hang<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.970> egg<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.870> stand<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
going to hang my egg from a stand put a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.750

little bit of white glue on your work
surface<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.650> attach

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
surface and you'll use that to attach

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.900 
surface and you'll use that to attach
your<00:01:44.520> clay<00:01:45.350> dip<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.560> toothpick<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.670> glue

and just add tiny dots along your drawn
lines<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.310> attach

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
lines and then you're going to attach

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.380 
lines and then you're going to attach
your<00:01:54.000> clay<00:01:54.330> string<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.910> pick<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> piece

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
your clay string to that pick up a piece

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.300 
your clay string to that pick up a piece
of<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.720> clay<00:01:57.960> string<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:59.130> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of your clay string and you're just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.870 
of your clay string and you're just
going<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.610> tap<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.270> gently<00:02:00.660> onto<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.710> egg

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
going to tap it gently onto the egg

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
going to tap it gently onto the egg
following<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> line<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.360> glue<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.350> made

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
following the line of glue that you made

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.949 
following the line of glue that you made
over<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.970> top<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.450> pencil<00:02:06.810> drawing<00:02:07.050> and

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
over the top of your pencil drawing and

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.990 
over the top of your pencil drawing and
this<00:02:09.959> takes<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.380> little<00:02:10.500> bit<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> time<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.640> want

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this takes a little bit of time you want

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.180 
this takes a little bit of time you want
to<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> gently<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:13.230> press<00:02:13.590> too<00:02:13.620> hard

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
to do it gently don't press too hard

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.729 
to do it gently don't press too hard
otherwise<00:02:14.430> you'll<00:02:15.180> flatten<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.930> lines<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
otherwise you'll flatten the lines and

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.000 
otherwise you'll flatten the lines and
then<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.060> liquid<00:02:18.720> clay<00:02:19.080> will<00:02:19.260> flow<00:02:19.500> over<00:02:19.709> them

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
then the liquid clay will flow over them

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.340 
then the liquid clay will flow over them
you<00:02:20.550> want<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.850> create<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.360> cells<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
you want to create little cells that the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.520

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
with the heat gun 4 before baking I'm

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.000 
with the heat gun 4 before baking I'm
going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.720> use<00:03:32.840> some<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.260> green<00:03:33.560> liquid

just<00:03:47.840> gonna<00:03:48.050> guide<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.950> little<00:03:49.340> ball<00:03:49.580> of

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
just gonna guide that little ball of

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.270 
just gonna guide that little ball of
liquid<00:03:50.060> all<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:51.200> way<00:03:51.320> around<00:03:51.680> as<00:03:51.890> if<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.160> were

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
liquid all the way around as if you were

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.800 
liquid all the way around as if you were
coloring<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.300> leaf<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:56.180> want<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.480> spread

coloring in the leaf you want to spread
it<00:03:56.960> around<00:03:57.050> as<00:03:57.500> evenly<00:03:57.950> as<00:03:58.070> possible<00:03:59.560> but<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
it around as evenly as possible but you

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.130 
it around as evenly as possible but you
don't<00:04:01.010> want<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.400> thick<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.750> it's<00:04:02.930> going

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
don't want it so thick that it's going

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.730 
don't want it so thick that it's going
to<00:04:03.260> overflow<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:04.310> walls<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.180> design<00:04:05.740> it's

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
to overflow the walls of the design it's

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.340 
to overflow the walls of the design it's
better<00:04:07.160> if<00:04:07.520> it's<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:08.000> little<00:04:08.240> bit<00:04:08.360> less<00:04:08.660> rather

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
better if it's a little bit less rather

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:20.150 
better if it's a little bit less rather
than<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.740> little<00:04:10.040> bit<00:04:10.190> more

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
you'll use about three times as much of

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.290 
you'll use about three times as much of
