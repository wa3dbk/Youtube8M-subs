00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.540 

you

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.630 

now<00:05:51.420> as<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:52.110> can<00:05:52.260> see<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.710> arm<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:53.040> not<00:05:53.070> maxed

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
now as you can see that arm is not maxed

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.730 
now as you can see that arm is not maxed
out<00:05:53.790> like<00:05:54.090> most<00:05:54.390> people<00:05:54.810> who<00:05:55.080> drive

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
out like most people who drive

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.680 
out like most people who drive
direwolf's<00:05:56.430> do<00:05:56.700> but<00:05:57.030> that's<00:05:57.240> because<00:05:57.420> I

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
direwolf's do but that's because I

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.600 
direwolf's do but that's because I
needed<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.110> space<00:05:58.230> to<00:05:58.530> accommodate<00:05:59.160> more

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
needed the space to accommodate more

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:08.180 
needed the space to accommodate more
ammo<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:01.800> six<00:06:02.400> AC<00:06:03.180> vibes<00:06:03.950> but<00:06:04.950> um<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:07.710> was

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
ammo and the six AC vibes but um I was

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.820 
ammo and the six AC vibes but um I was
going<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.490> put<00:06:08.610> heatsinks<00:06:09.120> on<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.830> like

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
going to put heatsinks on it like

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.860 
going to put heatsinks on it like
additional<00:06:11.280> heat<00:06:11.430> sinks<00:06:11.790> but<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.120> noticed<00:06:12.630> that

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
additional heat sinks but I noticed that

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.790 
additional heat sinks but I noticed that
with<00:06:13.200> just<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.520> five<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.600> 685<00:06:16.320> is<00:06:16.500> equipped

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
with just the five the 685 is equipped

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.060 
with just the five the 685 is equipped
with<00:06:16.890> nothing<00:06:17.460> else<00:06:17.870> that<00:06:18.870> I<00:06:18.900> had<00:06:19.140> a<00:06:19.170> maxed<00:06:19.890> out

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
with nothing else that I had a maxed out

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.950 
with nothing else that I had a maxed out
heat<00:06:20.400> management<00:06:20.670> so<00:06:21.330> it<00:06:21.630> would<00:06:21.750> never

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
heat management so it would never

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.600 
heat management so it would never
overheat<00:06:22.410> so<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:22.650> just<00:06:22.830> figured<00:06:23.160> I<00:06:23.400> might<00:06:23.550> as

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
overheat so I just figured I might as

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.640 
overheat so I just figured I might as
well<00:06:23.730> just<00:06:24.030> completely<00:06:24.960> fill<00:06:25.260> it<00:06:25.380> with<00:06:25.470> ammo

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
well just completely fill it with ammo

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.030 
well just completely fill it with ammo
as<00:06:25.950> I<00:06:26.960> think<00:06:27.960> it's<00:06:28.080> a<00:06:28.170> thousand<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:28.710> fifty

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
as I think it's a thousand and fifty

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.220 
as I think it's a thousand and fifty
rounds<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:29.610> won't<00:06:30.150> run<00:06:30.360> out<00:06:30.390> throughout<00:06:30.990> the

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
rounds so won't run out throughout the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.780 
rounds so won't run out throughout the
course<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.590> a<00:06:31.680> match<00:06:32.150> but<00:06:33.150> yeah<00:06:33.330> like<00:06:33.690> reduced

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
course of a match but yeah like reduced

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.190 
course of a match but yeah like reduced
arms<00:06:35.790> and<00:06:36.500> torso<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:38.070> leg<00:06:38.790> armor<00:06:39.210> kept<00:06:39.930> head

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
arms and torso and leg armor kept head

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.320 
arms and torso and leg armor kept head
and<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:41.400> chest<00:06:41.780> area<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:46.110> maxed<00:06:46.590> out<00:06:46.710> from

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
and the chest area and maxed out from

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.810 
and the chest area and maxed out from
armor<00:06:48.330> most<00:06:48.960> important<00:06:49.470> parts<00:06:49.770> but<00:06:50.070> I<00:06:50.100> have<00:06:50.250> to

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
armor most important parts but I have to

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.370 
armor most important parts but I have to
drop<00:06:51.030> armor<00:06:51.330> to<00:06:51.420> be<00:06:51.450> able<00:06:51.690> to<00:06:51.750> accommodate<00:06:52.260> it

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
drop armor to be able to accommodate it

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.360 
drop armor to be able to accommodate it
but<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.860> is<00:06:53.190> amazing<00:06:54.830> basically<00:06:55.830> just<00:06:55.860> use<00:06:56.190> the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
but it is amazing basically just use the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.560 
but it is amazing basically just use the
Prime<00:06:56.670> and<00:06:56.880> then<00:06:57.240> swap<00:06:57.600> out<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:59.090> the<00:07:00.090> left<00:07:00.330> and

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
Prime and then swap out the the left and

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.740 
Prime and then swap out the the left and
right<00:07:00.600> hand<00:07:01.020> toss<00:07:01.260> those<00:07:01.530> slots<00:07:01.890> from<00:07:02.750> the

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
right hand toss those slots from the

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.080 
right hand toss those slots from the
b-type<00:07:04.260> torso<00:07:05.160> so<00:07:05.340> you<00:07:05.430> can<00:07:05.580> get<00:07:05.700> the<00:07:05.760> twin

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
b-type torso so you can get the twin

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.590 
b-type torso so you can get the twin
ballistic<00:07:06.570> card<00:07:06.750> points<00:07:07.640> and<00:07:08.640> that's<00:07:09.000> that's

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
ballistic card points and that's that's

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.280 
ballistic card points and that's that's
the<00:07:09.780> fit<00:07:10.220> if<00:07:11.220> you<00:07:11.520> wait<00:07:12.450> for<00:07:12.720> next<00:07:12.810> week<00:07:13.110> next

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
the fit if you wait for next week next

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.430 
the fit if you wait for next week next
week<00:07:13.560> I'll<00:07:13.800> be<00:07:13.830> doing<00:07:14.070> another<00:07:14.370> video<00:07:14.610> with<00:07:14.970> my

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 
week I'll be doing another video with my

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.250 
week I'll be doing another video with my
dire<00:07:16.440> wolf<00:07:16.680> b-type<00:07:17.400> which<00:07:18.150> has<00:07:18.510> a<00:07:19.160> quad<00:07:21.260> clan

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.050 
dire wolf b-type which has a quad clan
ultra<00:07:22.830> AC<00:07:23.070> 20s<00:07:24.530> you'll<00:07:25.530> get<00:07:25.680> to<00:07:25.800> see<00:07:25.980> that<00:07:26.130> so

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
ultra AC 20s you'll get to see that so

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:37.239 
ultra AC 20s you'll get to see that so
uh<00:07:27.090> thanks<00:07:27.510> for<00:07:27.930> watching<00:07:28.380> guys<00:07:28.620> and<00:07:29.360> enjoy
