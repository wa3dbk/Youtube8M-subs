you see I'm moving it like that and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.100 
you see I'm moving it like that and
we're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> ahead<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.939> play<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> game

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.810 

you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.229> play<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> second<00:01:47.009> level<00:01:47.369> third

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you can play the second level third

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.870 
you can play the second level third
level<00:01:47.880> fourth<00:01:48.360> level<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.770> original<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.820> a

different<00:01:51.240> map<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> X

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
different map so this one and that's X

my capture cards not working but kind of
give<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> demonstration<00:01:58.649> hopefully<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
give you a demonstration hopefully it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.679 
give you a demonstration hopefully it
works<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> controller<00:02:01.170> right<00:02:01.259> here

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
works this is the controller right here

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:09.619 
works this is the controller right here
alright<00:02:05.090> mine<00:02:06.950> alright<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.479> what

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
alright mine alright so right here what

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.270 
alright mine alright so right here what
we<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> pretty<00:02:10.410> much<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.770> layout<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
we have is pretty much a layout of the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.949 
we have is pretty much a layout of the
map<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.730> cloudy<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.300> once<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.599> discover

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
map it's so cloudy but once you discover

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.700 
map it's so cloudy but once you discover
more

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
more

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
more
we're<00:02:13.950> rounding<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.400> map<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.360> even

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
we're rounding the map you can even

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.060 
we're rounding the map you can even
cover<00:02:15.870> more<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.440> way<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.860> kind<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
cover more and this way you can kind of

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.550 
cover more and this way you can kind of
uncover<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.820> secret<00:02:18.720> places<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
uncover like you know secret places that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.680 
uncover like you know secret places that
you<00:02:19.680> met<00:02:19.830> my<00:02:20.160> miss<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.610> play<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.240> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
as you see the map is you know pretty

as you see the map is you know pretty
much<00:02:42.600> expand<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.500> giving<00:02:43.890> you

you're missing so as you see right there
your<00:02:52.410> plane<00:02:52.770> has<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> frog<00:02:53.600> everyday<00:02:54.600> all<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
your plane has a frog everyday all the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.570 
your plane has a frog everyday all the
buttons<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> same<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.130> guess

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
buttons are the same you know I guess

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.130 
buttons are the same you know I guess
would<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.880> more<00:02:57.060> difficult<00:02:57.210> on<00:02:57.720> games<00:02:57.930> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
would be more difficult on games that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.970 
would be more difficult on games that
require<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
require like it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.870 
require like it
the<00:02:59.370> r3<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.600> lr<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.680> l3<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.370> only<00:03:02.580> option

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the r3 or the lr the l3 the only option

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.220 
the r3 or the lr the l3 the only option
that<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.150> see<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> use<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.990> touchpad

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that can see is if you use the touchpad

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.400 
that can see is if you use the touchpad
for<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.250> substitute<00:03:06.180> right

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
for that substitute right

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.350 
for that substitute right
but<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:07.890> games<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.670> require<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.030> at

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
but if games that don't require that at

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.910 
but if games that don't require that at
all<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:09.930> pretty<00:03:10.470> much<00:03:10.620> simple

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
all and it's just pretty much simple

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.970 
all and it's just pretty much simple
like<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.100> analog<00:03:11.370> stick<00:03:11.820> or<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.120> dual<00:03:12.930> pad<00:03:13.710> or

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
like the analog stick or the dual pad or

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.130 
like the analog stick or the dual pad or
just<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> button<00:03:14.490> itself<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.660> really

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
just the button itself then really

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.720 
just the button itself then really
PlayStation<00:03:16.890> 4<00:03:17.070> games<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.550> have<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
PlayStation 4 games that just have that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.170 
PlayStation 4 games that just have that
are<00:03:18.000> PS<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.330> games<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:20.100> remote<00:03:20.940> play

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
are PS in games for that I remote play

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
are PS in games for that I remote play
in<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> cross<00:03:21.720> game<00:03:22.110> thing<00:03:22.440> would<00:03:22.740> work

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
in the cross game thing would work

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.830 
in the cross game thing would work
effectively<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:24.210> use<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.540> Vita<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
effectively and then use the Vita as a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.870 
effectively and then use the Vita as a
remote<00:03:25.170> control<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.280> guess<00:03:26.460> games<00:03:26.700> like

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
remote control but I guess games like

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.910 
remote control but I guess games like
maybe<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.270> Killzone<00:03:28.200> or<00:03:28.410> stuff<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.620> that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
maybe like Killzone or stuff like that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.240 
maybe like Killzone or stuff like that
which<00:03:29.460> require<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.810> use<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:30.990> pretty<00:03:31.980> much<00:03:32.010> all

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
which require the use of pretty much all

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.680 
which require the use of pretty much all
the<00:03:32.400> buttons<00:03:32.730> maybe<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.330> bit<00:03:33.420> more<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.630> a
