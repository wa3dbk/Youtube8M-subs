00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello girls welcome back protect today the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.350
 new nail art video in the art waters 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.820
 marble many of you have asked me 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 this technique I have done several 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.410
 video on this technique and I admit that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 it's not an easy nail art you need water 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 many patients need a lot of patience 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.430
 so take a cup part stand there 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.590
 finger for finger 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 those who are better do it even with more fingers 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 at the same time I must admit 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.450
 which is not the easy technique 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.329
 today I want to give you a valid alternative 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.670
 I work for marble I know it's not 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 same effect, however, that I brought them 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.989
 I brought this technique that is why 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 of us in the old girls they told me 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 that is, I like a chapel makes his own 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.430
 slutty figure this nail art is not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 as precise as the water marble though 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.270
 I repeat it's pretty 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.210
 if we do not do this 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 so now I leave you with the tutorial in the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 comments let me know what you think 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.589
 therefore only two glazes are used 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 change the colors on your choice 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.360
 we are at Christmas time 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 also use the red and green one 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 what you want short and release other ho 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 already applied a protective base and I have 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.590
 left to dry 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.000
 I spread the white pupa french enamel 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 manicure and don't let it dry 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.159
 then I take the glaze in china glaze 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.030
 I apply a few drops and with a daughter 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 or I'm going to recreate this 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.060
 wave motion thus creating the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.060
 water marble 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.680
 finally I passed a glittery touch 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 this is the cash balancing e derby 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:11.220
 the final result of Lazio will be 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:13.410
 this girls with this is all does 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.630
 think about how you make yourself think if you like 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.560
 share this video on the same 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.599
 salvation 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.599
 I remember that I have a trans profile 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.970
 and no girls at the next jump
