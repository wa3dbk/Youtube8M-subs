00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.780
 today 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
 Y 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 of people cooking with sense that is 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.750
 a sustainable cooking project that 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.220
 looks for an important impact on something 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.530
 that our mission is that people are 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.570
 with intellectual disability through 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.290
 the generation of employment for these 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.630
 people and an impact also on the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.350
 local development generating opportunities 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.239
 to local suppliers generating for 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.239
 so opportunity to our land 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.840
 of people cooking with sense is a 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 project that arises in a context of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.040
 difficulties in the field of employment of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.330
 people with disabilities and where the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.699
 promoter that in this case sanz prost 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.290
 with parents' association of people with 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.670
 disability of cantabria is understood 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.160
 that we have to look for other 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.600
 alternatives that allow us to generate 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.479
 greater opportunities 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 For that, we start working in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409
 a format centered on a model of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.159
 social responsibility where the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.929
 businessman does not have a performance 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.060
 the businessman participates in the project 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.130
 from a pure point of view they contribute 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.170
 sheet or brings knowledge but all the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.789
 return that the project has from the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 economic point of view is reinvested 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.069
 permanently in amparo projects 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.200
 or projects of the center itself 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.539
 people cooking consciences and then 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.819
 another one of the fundamental factors in 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.039
 we based the project is a model 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.750
 of different alliances where the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.579
 infrastructures are managed through 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 of alliances with different 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.209
 administrations in this case the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 santander city council with which from 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.829
 this point of view we have a 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.829
 different project 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.210
 Within the catering activity we have 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.310
 discovered that we can generate 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.110
 opportunities within the world of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.370
 organic orchards that satisfy 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.400
 directly our own 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.260
 ecological product needs 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.000
 We met ampros and we found a 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
 very committed company very powerful 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.640
 within the scope of Cantabria and what 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.320
 has brought light to the project has been 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.820
 two very important things one to the part 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.650
 Knowledge of technical expertise 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.120
 the recipes and then all a job 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 previous that we had done in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.920
 the restaurants contribute to all 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.780
 suppliers what we work for is a 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.940
 completely different and unique catering 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.920
 in spain because we work with 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.480
 suppliers directly is what 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.850
 Sometimes we like a purchase of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.010
 fair trade without intermediaries and 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.160
 we can directly serve it 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.020
 client we cover all types of collective 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.260
 from nurseries to centers of 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.270
 We are a team of ten people 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 six people with disabilities 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.560
 intellectual three with physical disability 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 the head chef and me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.220
 nabil every two years and if I arrive 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.489
 what I do are the special menus 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.680
 of the 5 calories from dhiacos 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.629
 tiny little ones are more 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.299
 tiny for the purÃ©es and all our 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.790
 special friend that I like this flight 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.579
 I started here without knowing how to do anything or of my 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.890
 home cooking mom and now here I have 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.790
 learned to do all kinds of food and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.790
 I like that a lot 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.710
 what I am most proud of in this 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.420
 project is to have believed in an idea 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.010
 and have achieved it up to 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.800
 consequently it is a project that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.280
 we think it's going well 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.840
 that generates employment that generates dynamism and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.840
 what excites and in the end
