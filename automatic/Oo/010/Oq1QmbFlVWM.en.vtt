00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
also didn't expect to see reuniclus in
Ganga<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.720> guess<00:00:22.289> that's<00:00:22.320> neither<00:00:22.680> here

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
Ganga but I guess that's neither here

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
Ganga but I guess that's neither here
nor<00:00:23.100> there<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.420> he's<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
nor there right now so he's going to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
nor there right now so he's going to
also<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:25.500> setup<00:00:25.680> rocks<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.779> I'm

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
also go into setup rocks and then I'm

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.029 
also go into setup rocks and then I'm
just<00:00:27.900> gonna<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.260> waterfowl<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.920> it's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.010 
set up spikes maybe get a spin off and
die<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.420> knew<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> be

physical<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.469> super<00:00:55.739> offensive<00:00:55.949> teams<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
physical got super offensive teams and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.720 
physical got super offensive teams and
this<00:00:57.500> team<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> I've<00:00:58.770> built<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.219> particular

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this team that I've built in particular

think<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> psychic<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.950> exactly<00:01:28.950> 50<00:01:29.100> 60<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
think from a psychic so exactly 50 60 so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
think from a psychic so exactly 50 60 so
i'm<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> set<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.020> litter<00:01:31.229> spikes<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
i'm going to set up litter spikes and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.200 
i'm going to set up litter spikes and
just<00:01:31.920> hope<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> he<00:01:32.369> knocked<00:01:32.549> me<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:32.790> custom

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
just hope that he knocked me into custom

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
just hope that he knocked me into custom
range<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.049> he<00:01:34.170> needs<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> deal<00:01:34.590> 59

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
range right now he needs to deal 59

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
range right now he needs to deal 59
points<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.729> i'll<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:36.960> deals<00:01:37.110> 58

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
points and i'll be there and he deals 58

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
points and i'll be there and he deals 58
so<00:01:38.299> first<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> bad<00:01:40.110> luck<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.750> got

get<00:04:57.409> something<00:04:57.650> asleep<00:04:58.009> but<00:04:58.330> gear<00:04:59.330> dose<00:04:59.479> was

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
get something asleep but gear dose was

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.029 
get something asleep but gear dose was
not<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.900> right<00:05:00.020> thing<00:05:00.050> and<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:00.680> think

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
not the right thing and that I think

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.890 
not the right thing and that I think
there's<00:05:01.250> no<00:05:01.430> friggin<00:05:02.060> way<00:05:02.090> he's<00:05:02.449> gonna<00:05:02.539> stay

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
there's no friggin way he's gonna stay

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.469 
there's no friggin way he's gonna stay
in<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.979> I<00:05:04.310> just<00:05:04.490> went<00:05:04.789> into<00:05:04.940> Swampert

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
in so I just went into Swampert

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.719 
in so I just went into Swampert
expecting<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.960> go<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.110> manga<00:05:06.440> zone<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.889> trying

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
expecting to go to manga zone and trying

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.520 
expecting to go to manga zone and trying
to<00:05:07.819> get<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:07.970> little<00:05:08.180> bit<00:05:08.389> of<00:05:08.449> momentum<00:05:08.569> that<00:05:09.289> way

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
to get a little bit of momentum that way

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.439 
to get a little bit of momentum that way
but<00:05:09.590> he<00:05:10.460> stays<00:05:10.699> in<00:05:10.849> he<00:05:10.970> winds<00:05:11.120> up<00:05:11.180> having<00:05:11.300> to

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
but he stays in he winds up having to

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.040 
but he stays in he winds up having to
sleep<00:05:11.599> talk<00:05:11.750> he<00:05:12.319> rolls<00:05:13.150> waterfall<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.449> that's

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
sleep talk he rolls waterfall and that's

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.170 
sleep talk he rolls waterfall and that's
the<00:05:15.289> game<00:05:15.440> like<00:05:15.860> there's<00:05:16.699> nothing<00:05:16.969> else<00:05:17.060> I

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the game like there's nothing else I

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.680 
the game like there's nothing else I
could<00:05:17.240> do<00:05:17.449> um<00:05:18.969> you<00:05:19.969> know<00:05:20.090> once<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:20.630> thing

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
could do um you know once this thing

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.909 
could do um you know once this thing
went<00:05:20.930> down<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:21.139> don't<00:05:21.259> know<00:05:21.349> if<00:05:21.409> he<00:05:21.500> had<00:05:21.590> rest<00:05:21.800> on

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
went down I don't know if he had rest on

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.730 
went down I don't know if he had rest on
that<00:05:21.949> set<00:05:22.250> if<00:05:22.490> he<00:05:22.639> did<00:05:22.789> then<00:05:23.000> I<00:05:23.210> guess<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:24.169> got<00:05:24.710> a

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
that set if he did then I guess I got a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.920 
that set if he did then I guess I got a
bit<00:05:24.830> unlucky<00:05:25.250> alright<00:05:25.879> I<00:05:25.909> didn't<00:05:26.300> get<00:05:26.389> lucky<00:05:26.780> I

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
bit unlucky alright I didn't get lucky I

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.120 
bit unlucky alright I didn't get lucky I
guess<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:28.490> he<00:05:28.550> didn't<00:05:28.759> roll<00:05:28.909> rest<00:05:29.180> but<00:05:30.130> he

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
guess and he didn't roll rest but he

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.200 
guess and he didn't roll rest but he
would've<00:05:31.310> had<00:05:31.340> another<00:05:31.639> chance<00:05:31.789> this<00:05:32.000> turn

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
would've had another chance this turn

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.309 
would've had another chance this turn
assuming<00:05:32.900> he<00:05:32.930> didn't<00:05:33.139> wake<00:05:33.259> up<00:05:33.469> that<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.069> and

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
assuming he didn't wake up that is and

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.480 
assuming he didn't wake up that is and
you<00:05:36.319> know<00:05:36.349> because<00:05:36.650> he's<00:05:36.800> able<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.400> say

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
you know because he's able to just say

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.100 
you know because he's able to just say
that<00:05:37.669> thing<00:05:37.759> is<00:05:37.789> sleep<00:05:38.389> water<00:05:38.569> now<00:05:38.750> i<00:05:38.780> can't

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
sleep this magma zone and it's just

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.100 
sleep this magma zone and it's just
gonna<00:05:40.490> slowly<00:05:41.090> kill<00:05:41.449> me<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.630> signal<00:05:41.930> beam

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
gonna slowly kill me the signal beam

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.189 
gonna slowly kill me the signal beam
there's<00:05:42.349> nothing<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.710> do<00:05:42.919> so<00:05:44.050> this<00:05:45.050> was

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
there's nothing I can do so this was

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.260 
there's nothing I can do so this was
just<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.650> Murphy's<00:05:46.400> Law<00:05:46.610> game<00:05:46.909> pretty<00:05:47.180> much

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
just a Murphy's Law game pretty much

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.510 
just a Murphy's Law game pretty much
anything<00:05:48.229> that<00:05:48.349> could<00:05:48.529> have<00:05:48.590> gone<00:05:48.650> wrong<00:05:48.770> did

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
anything that could have gone wrong did

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.850 
anything that could have gone wrong did
this<00:05:50.509> didn't<00:05:50.900> bring<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.169> team<00:05:51.319> expected<00:05:51.740> him

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
this didn't bring the team expected him

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.200 
this didn't bring the team expected him
to<00:05:51.979> bring<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.250> expect<00:05:52.520> this<00:05:52.610> seat<00:05:52.880> where<00:05:53.029> is<00:05:53.090> he

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
to bring I expect this seat where is he

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.950 
to bring I expect this seat where is he
on<00:05:53.240> did<00:05:54.110> not<00:05:54.229> expect<00:05:54.469> to<00:05:54.590> see<00:05:54.770> reuniclus<00:05:55.190> so<00:05:55.960> I

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
on did not expect to see reuniclus so I

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.939 
on did not expect to see reuniclus so I
could<00:05:57.349> have<00:05:57.440> dealt<00:05:57.560> with<00:05:57.620> those<00:05:57.830> things

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
could have dealt with those things

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.430 
could have dealt with those things
though<00:05:58.810> unfortunately<00:05:59.810> even<00:06:00.050> things<00:06:00.380> that

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
though unfortunately even things that

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.620 
though unfortunately even things that
are<00:06:00.590> normally<00:06:01.009> considered<00:06:01.430> blocky<00:06:01.789> like<00:06:02.060> a

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
are normally considered blocky like a

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.350 
are normally considered blocky like a
nice<00:06:03.409> early<00:06:03.590> scald<00:06:04.039> burn<00:06:04.250> or<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.580> lower<00:06:05.120> damage

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
nice early scald burn or a lower damage

rule<00:06:05.719> they<00:06:06.500> just<00:06:06.729> didn't<00:06:07.729> work<00:06:07.880> out<00:06:08.060> for<00:06:08.120> me

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
rule they just didn't work out for me

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.980 
rule they just didn't work out for me
they<00:06:08.539> screwed<00:06:08.810> me<00:06:08.840> right<00:06:09.110> in<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.229> ass<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:10.990> you

winds up being assault vest with very

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.459 
winds up being assault vest with very
little<00:06:56.149> speed<00:06:56.449> investments<00:06:56.929> so<00:06:57.109> Swampert

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
little speed investments so Swampert

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.009 
little speed investments so Swampert
could<00:06:57.619> vets<00:06:57.769> but<00:06:57.949> it<00:06:58.239> it<00:06:59.239> turns<00:06:59.599> the<00:06:59.719> endgame

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.019 
could vets but it it turns the endgame

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.439 
could vets but it it turns the endgame
into<00:07:00.679> an<00:07:00.859> interesting<00:07:01.429> like<00:07:01.729> predict<00:07:02.179> fest

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
into an interesting like predict fest

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.899 
into an interesting like predict fest
like<00:07:02.659> does<00:07:02.839> he<00:07:02.899> go<00:07:03.019> to<00:07:03.049> Ganga<00:07:03.499> or<00:07:03.559> does<00:07:03.739> he<00:07:03.909> does

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
like does he go to Ganga or does he does

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.699 
like does he go to Ganga or does he does
he<00:07:04.939> not<00:07:05.179> do<00:07:05.419> I<00:07:05.449> earthquake<00:07:05.929> do<00:07:06.109> I<00:07:06.139> waterfall

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:06.709 
he not do I earthquake do I waterfall

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:08.919 
he not do I earthquake do I waterfall
you<00:07:07.399> know<00:07:07.489> that<00:07:07.609> kind<00:07:07.729> of<00:07:07.819> thing<00:07:07.879> I<00:07:08.419> could<00:07:08.869> have

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:08.929 
you know that kind of thing I could have

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.809 
you know that kind of thing I could have
eventually<00:07:09.289> stun<00:07:09.679> spore<00:07:09.949> gengar<00:07:10.279> maybe<00:07:10.489> and

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819 
eventually stun spore gengar maybe and

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.179 
eventually stun spore gengar maybe and
kyndra<00:07:11.809> could<00:07:11.929> have<00:07:12.019> oats<00:07:12.139> but<00:07:12.289> it<00:07:12.409> too<00:07:12.559> so<00:07:12.919> I

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:13.189 
kyndra could have oats but it too so I

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.759 
kyndra could have oats but it too so I
don't<00:07:14.149> know<00:07:14.209> it<00:07:14.269> just<00:07:14.329> it<00:07:14.569> just<00:07:14.659> becomes<00:07:15.019> a<00:07:15.409> big

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:15.769 
don't know it just it just becomes a big

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.239 
don't know it just it just becomes a big
old<00:07:17.079> clusterfuck<00:07:18.079> like<00:07:18.259> I<00:07:18.349> think<00:07:18.529> Gengar<00:07:19.069> does

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.249 
old clusterfuck like I think Gengar does

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.259 
old clusterfuck like I think Gengar does
like<00:07:19.399> forty<00:07:19.819> percent<00:07:20.439> maximum<00:07:21.439> to<00:07:22.249> Mingus<00:07:22.789> so

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:23.269 
like forty percent maximum to Mingus so

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:25.989 
like forty percent maximum to Mingus so
it<00:07:23.869> could<00:07:23.989> definitely<00:07:24.169> take<00:07:24.409> the<00:07:24.559> hits<00:07:24.999> and

00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:25.999 
it could definitely take the hits and

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:29.289 
it could definitely take the hits and
but<00:07:26.599> you<00:07:26.929> know<00:07:27.049> that<00:07:27.349> kind<00:07:27.499> of<00:07:27.589> thing<00:07:28.119> I'm<00:07:29.119> just

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:29.299
