two most important ones of these are the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.760 
two most important ones of these are the
fuel<00:01:14.090> tank<00:01:14.360> which<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:14.780> mounted<00:01:14.960> quite<00:01:15.470> far

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
both of them a design to free up loads

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.530 
both of them a design to free up loads
of<00:01:22.190> space<00:01:22.430> at<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.700> back<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.240> can<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.510> a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
of space at the back so you can have a

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.690 
of space at the back so you can have a
bigger<00:01:23.810> boot<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.290> lowes<00:01:24.620> more<00:01:24.860> legroom<00:01:25.100> the

bigger boot and lowes more legroom the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.190 
bigger boot and lowes more legroom the
only<00:01:25.909> problem<00:01:26.090> with<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.300> hatchback<00:01:26.510> is<00:01:26.930> it's

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
only problem with a hatchback is it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.350 
only problem with a hatchback is it's
not<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.620> most<00:01:27.950> comfortable<00:01:28.220> car<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.909> ride<00:01:29.150> it

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
not the most comfortable car to ride it

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.950 
not the most comfortable car to ride it
in<00:01:29.570> terms<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.710> styling<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.580> seems<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:32.690> the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
in terms of styling it seems that the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.990 
in terms of styling it seems that the
kind<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.530> styling<00:01:33.979> ethos<00:01:34.400> that's<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:34.909> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
kind of styling ethos that's on the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.570 
kind of styling ethos that's on the
hatchback<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.720> much<00:01:36.409> better<00:01:36.710> suited<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.430> this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
hatchback is much better suited to this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.240 
hatchback is much better suited to this
estate<00:01:38.240> version<00:01:38.659> kind<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> pulling<00:01:39.830> out<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
estate version kind of pulling out and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.370 
estate version kind of pulling out and
extending<00:01:40.790> those<00:01:40.940> lines<00:01:41.330> makes<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.050> much

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
extending those lines makes it a much

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.920 
extending those lines makes it a much
much<00:01:42.710> cleaner<00:01:43.040> design<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.909> turtle<00:01:44.600> things<00:01:44.750> we

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
much cleaner design and turtle things we

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.990 
much cleaner design and turtle things we
really<00:01:45.140> like<00:01:45.440> our<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.950> kind<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.220> bulky<00:01:46.640> line

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
really like our this kind of bulky line

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.300 
really like our this kind of bulky line
across<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> top<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.140> rear<00:01:48.770> wheel<00:01:49.040> arch

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.210 
across the top of the rear wheel arch
and<00:01:49.880> also<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.299> hidden<00:01:50.659> rear<00:01:50.990> door<00:01:51.320> handles<00:01:51.799> we

and also the hidden rear door handles we

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.710
