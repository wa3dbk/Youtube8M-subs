00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi everyone today we're going to look at
the<00:00:02.190> VTech<00:00:02.790> doc<00:00:03.750> mcstuffins<00:00:04.410> talking<00:00:04.950> trace

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
the VTech doc mcstuffins talking trace

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.190 
the VTech doc mcstuffins talking trace
clipboard<00:00:05.850> as<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.359> see<00:00:06.509> right<00:00:06.690> here<00:00:06.750> it's

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
clipboard as you can see right here it's

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.980 
clipboard as you can see right here it's
a<00:00:07.519> clipboard<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.210> write<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.690> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
a clipboard that you can write on and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.780 
a clipboard that you can write on and
then<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:10.590> you're<00:00:10.740> done<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.670> simply

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
then when you're done you can simply

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.470 
then when you're done you can simply
move<00:00:14.790> back<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.630> simply<00:00:16.520> wipe<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.699> away<00:00:17.820> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
move back you can simply wipe it away so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.609 
move back you can simply wipe it away so
we're<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.199> works<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
we're going to see how this works and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.810 
we're going to see how this works and
see<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.010> maybe<00:00:20.340> something<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
see if this is maybe something that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.960 
see if this is maybe something that
you'd<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.359> interested<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:22.550> okay<00:00:23.550> let's<00:00:23.850> see

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
you'd be interested in okay let's see

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.670 
you'd be interested in okay let's see
how<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> Disney<00:00:24.570> talk<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> trace<00:00:25.170> clipboard

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
how the Disney talk and trace clipboard

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.349 
how the Disney talk and trace clipboard
actually<00:00:26.010> works<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.910> first<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.240> we're

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
actually works so the first thing we're

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.800 
actually works so the first thing we're
doing<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> turn<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> right

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
doing is going to turn it out so right

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.010 
doing is going to turn it out so right
so<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.230> turn<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:37.489> anything<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
so you can turn out anything is like so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
so you can turn out anything is like so
then<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.680> through<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> different<00:00:50.180> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
then you can go through the different so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.750 
then you can go through the different so
maybe<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> draw<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.170> fruit<00:00:52.590> try<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> draw<00:00:53.489> an

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
maybe we can draw a fruit try to draw an

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.350 
maybe we can draw a fruit try to draw an
apple

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.270 

we<00:01:27.340> get<00:01:30.899> all<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.200> different<00:01:32.530> modes<00:01:32.619> but<00:01:33.159> it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
we get all the different modes but it

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.240 
we get all the different modes but it
also<00:01:33.399> comes<00:01:33.759> with<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.960> trace<00:01:35.439> pads<00:01:35.710> and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
also comes with these trace pads and

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.749 
also comes with these trace pads and
we'll<00:01:36.369> see<00:01:36.490> how<00:01:36.640> they<00:01:36.789> work<00:01:37.000> next

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
we'll see how they work next

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.120 
we'll see how they work next
okay<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:39.820> we'll<00:01:40.030> put<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.329> trace<00:01:40.539> pad<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:41.130> just

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
okay so we'll put the trace pad in just

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.480 
okay so we'll put the trace pad in just
like<00:01:42.250> that

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
like that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:55.289 
like that
and<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.179> just<00:01:43.450> trace<00:01:46.229> letters<00:01:54.179> then<00:01:55.179> you

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
and then you just trace letters then you

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.760 
and then you just trace letters then you
remove<00:01:55.569> it<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:00.789> you<00:02:00.970> go<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:02.740> have

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
remove it and there you go we have

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.559 
remove it and there you go we have
another<00:02:03.039> pad<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.490> has<00:02:03.670> numbers<00:02:03.939> on<00:02:04.209> it<00:02:04.330> and

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
another pad that has numbers on it and

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.440 
another pad that has numbers on it and
some<00:02:05.439> things<00:02:05.679> down<00:02:05.830> here<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:06.909> can<00:02:07.119> do<00:02:07.240> like

some things down here so you can do like

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.640 
some things down here so you can do like
the<00:02:07.630> nut<00:02:07.780> ball<00:02:07.929> dude<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> number<00:02:08.380> two<00:02:10.650> let's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the nut ball dude the number two let's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.520

make<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.069> agree<00:02:12.220> eight<00:02:14.880> nine<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.540> then<00:02:17.440> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
make you agree eight nine and then you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.770 
make you agree eight nine and then you
can<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:17.769> you've<00:02:17.890> got<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.040> hand<00:02:18.630> now<00:02:19.630> these

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
can see you've got a hand now these

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.640 
can see you've got a hand now these
don't<00:02:20.019> work<00:02:20.200> quite<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.709> well<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:23.140> even<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.440> BAM

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
don't work quite as well and even a BAM

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.890 
don't work quite as well and even a BAM
Billy<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.269> can't<00:02:28.510> really<00:02:28.630> get<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
Billy and I can't really get the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.140 
Billy and I can't really get the
band-aid<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.380> work<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.310> we'll<00:02:30.459> remove<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
band-aid to work so we'll remove it and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.059 
band-aid to work so we'll remove it and
that's<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.480> pad<00:02:34.660> now<00:02:35.260> there<00:02:35.410> are<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> few<00:02:35.650> flaws

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
that's the pad now there are a few flaws

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's the pad now there are a few flaws
with<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.579> it'd<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> nice<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.840> pin<00:02:38.680> was<00:02:39.640> a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
with this it'd be nice if the pin was a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.340 
with this it'd be nice if the pin was a
little<00:02:40.150> bit<00:02:40.359> longer<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:40.930> actually<00:02:41.200> kind

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
little bit longer so it's actually kind

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.809 
little bit longer so it's actually kind
of<00:02:41.410> tough<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.859> draw<00:02:42.190> down<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.579> at<00:02:42.639> the<00:02:42.700> very

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
of tough to draw down here at the very

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.289 
of tough to draw down here at the very
bottom<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:44.500> also<00:02:44.650> can't<00:02:45.069> really<00:02:45.459> draw<00:02:45.790> real

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
bottom you also can't really draw real

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.990 
bottom you also can't really draw real
fine<00:02:46.720> things<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.730> way<00:02:48.850> this

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
fine things because on the way this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.750 
fine things because on the way this
works<00:02:49.299> it's<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.810> magnet<00:02:50.290> you've<00:02:51.190> got<00:02:51.370> sand

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
works it's just a magnet you've got sand

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.280 
works it's just a magnet you've got sand
and<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.269> magnet<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.989> hip<00:02:53.170> right<00:02:53.410> here<00:02:55.290> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and a magnet on this hip right here and
