 in your wall of agreement that by the way 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.630

 436 registered who have not shared the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.399
 picture on your wall and that the system has 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.880
 automatically discarded most 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.570
 of them will be participants of Spain 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.630
 we will enter into the management and here 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.090
 we have what would be the draw with the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.870
 links and everything else we're going to take the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.690
 option to take out the winners 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.000
 but first we will go participants

 inside participants you can see that each 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.980
 one of those that you have registered figure 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.770
 here and the system recognizes if you have 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.450
 posted or not on the wall 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 that was one of the requirements 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.630
 we will go to winners 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.930
 We do not exclude any of us or 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.730
 neither do we include any two thousand 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 996 participants that have been left 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.819
 they have met all the requirements 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.819
 sharing the photo and others 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.550
 The finalists participate in the draw 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.450
 all registered in February 1996 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.450
 we confirm the finalists 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.980
 As we have said, everyone participates 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.810
 and we take the option to select the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.550
 winners through easy promos this 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.310
 what is it we wanted with a system 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.100
 automatic computer will choose 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.550
 winner here does not intervene at all to 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.550
 we 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.590
 select winners randomly and 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.450
 if we try it provides the platform 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.890
 to select the degrees of form 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.650
 randomly from the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.620
 participations of the finalists of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.640
 agreement then we indicate we put a 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.349
 winner and we will put several substitutes 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.200
 because I will explain why 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.299
 we had not done it in some 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.540
 but now we will put 3 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.540
 substitutes 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.230
 because the draws we have realized 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.240
 that many people do if there are any 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.890
 that is only registered exclusively 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 for the draw that at the time that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 let's take out the winner no longer listed as 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.520
 Fan of the page will be automatically 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.280
 eliminated and will go to the first of the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.400
 finalists of the substitutes in this case 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.630
 and so on I say it because it's 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.180
 more logical to reward who continues and 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.920
 is pending and is with us and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.810
 besides that not one that just points 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.920
 for the draw and then after 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.560
 disappear and you're done 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.239
 The next step is to select who 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.709
 clearly says that remember that only 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.110
 you can get the winners and substitutes 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.840
 through if you try only once for 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.239
 promotion with which what comes out here 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.290
 is what is already final and is 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.340
 unmodifiable we say yes 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.530
 and he has chosen or whether the winner is 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.910
 arnoldo sÃ¡nchez and alternates in case of 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.160
 who will not meet any of the requirements 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.350
 that commented that it was not fan os 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.840
 He had given Pajin has dropped from 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.690
 the page would pass as following as 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.660
 first order king and borja as alternates 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.620
 and then these two people more 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.620
 here we will tell you 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.569
 that we finished 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.770
 we will use the template disip loins and 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.770
 we went to publish the winners 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.909
 the winners are already published 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.620
 you know who is the winner many 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.080
 Thanks for your participation and you 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.800
 we hope on the next occasion many 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.800
 thanks to everyone
