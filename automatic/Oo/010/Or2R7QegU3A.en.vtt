00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
filtered that water for you and now you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.010 
filtered that water for you and now you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
plants natural filtering ability so you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.199 
plants natural filtering ability so you

water<00:02:26.480> from<00:02:27.050> your<00:02:27.320> juice<00:02:31.300> we're<00:02:32.300> going<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
water from your juice we're going to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.100 
water from your juice we're going to
move<00:02:32.630> on<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.980> why<00:02:34.730> does<00:02:35.690> juicing

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
move on here and so why does juicing

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.780 
move on here and so why does juicing
provide<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.800> more<00:02:37.010> energy<00:02:37.190> than<00:02:37.580> maybe

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
provide you with more energy than maybe

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.820 
provide you with more energy than maybe
just<00:02:38.090> eating<00:02:38.390> an<00:02:38.510> apple<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.989> let<00:02:39.380> me<00:02:39.500> let<00:02:39.739> me

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
just eating an apple and let me let me

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.910 
just eating an apple and let me let me
explain<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.330> takes<00:02:44.540> energy<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.110> digest<00:02:45.410> our

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
explain so it takes energy to digest our

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.250 
explain so it takes energy to digest our
foods<00:02:46.220> when<00:02:46.459> we<00:02:46.610> eat<00:02:46.820> any<00:02:47.030> meal<00:02:47.270> our<00:02:47.720> body<00:02:48.020> has

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
foods when we eat any meal our body has

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.510 
foods when we eat any meal our body has
to<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.620> our<00:02:48.709> district<00:02:49.100> digestive

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
to you know our district digestive

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.040 
to you know our district digestive
system<00:02:49.760> has<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.030> start<00:02:50.270> working<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.780> praise

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
system has to start working to praise

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.590 
system has to start working to praise
down<00:02:51.290> those<00:02:51.530> foods<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.880> extract<00:02:53.330> energy

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
down those foods and to extract energy

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.810 
down those foods and to extract energy
from<00:02:53.810> those<00:02:54.170> foods<00:02:54.470> right<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.340> we've<00:02:55.489> all<00:02:55.640> had

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.300 
energy taken away from you and juicing
is<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.600> exact<00:03:35.989> opposite<00:03:36.650> end<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.070> it's

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
is on the exact opposite end and it's

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.650 
is on the exact opposite end and it's
going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.820> provide<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.120> with<00:03:38.269> more<00:03:38.510> energy

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
going to provide you with more energy

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.199 
going to provide you with more energy
and<00:03:38.930> here's<00:03:39.530> why<00:03:39.769> when<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.519> juice<00:03:40.820> you're

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
and here's why when you juice you're

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.300 
and here's why when you juice you're
basically<00:03:41.360> separating<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.590> juice<00:03:42.920> from<00:03:43.160> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
basically separating the juice from the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.449 
basically separating the juice from the
fiber<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.410> when<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.500> drink<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.860> juice<00:03:46.100> our

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
fiber and when you drink the juice our

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.479 
fiber and when you drink the juice our
bodies<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.120> only<00:03:47.360> absorb<00:03:47.860> nutrients<00:03:48.860> that

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
bodies can only absorb nutrients that

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.090 
bodies can only absorb nutrients that
are<00:03:49.549> in<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.850> liquid<00:03:50.090> state<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.900> our<00:03:51.680> small

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
are in a liquid state in our small

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.530 
are in a liquid state in our small
intestines<00:03:52.610> through<00:03:52.850> our<00:03:52.940> Villa<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.360> there's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
intestines through our Villa and there's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.300 
intestines through our Villa and there's
a<00:03:53.600> picture<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.560> villa<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.040> bottom

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
a picture of the villa I on the bottom

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.069 
a picture of the villa I on the bottom
of<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.459> slide<00:03:55.700> there<00:03:56.000> if<00:03:56.480> they're<00:03:56.720> basically

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
of the slide there if they're basically

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.960 
of the slide there if they're basically
like<00:03:57.200> hairlike<00:03:57.799> strands<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.579> basically

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
like hairlike strands that basically

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.990 
like hairlike strands that basically
things<00:03:59.570> flow<00:03:59.900> by<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:01.310> villi<00:04:01.519> basically

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
things flow by and the villi basically

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.360 
things flow by and the villi basically
pick<00:04:02.390> up<00:04:02.540> things<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.870> liquids

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
pick up things and liquids

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.280 
pick up things and liquids
then<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.909> bring<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.330> into<00:04:04.629> your<00:04:04.750> into

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
then you know bring that into your into

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.259 
then you know bring that into your into
your<00:04:05.319> body<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.310> use<00:04:06.489> otherwise<00:04:07.030> it

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
your body for you to use otherwise it

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.430 
your body for you to use otherwise it
passes<00:04:07.690> right<00:04:07.840> through<00:04:07.900> there<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.319> then

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
passes right through there and then

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.270 
passes right through there and then
comes<00:04:08.950> out<00:04:09.099> one<00:04:09.310> end<00:04:09.519> right<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.239> other<00:04:10.360> end<00:04:11.280> so

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
comes out one end right the other end so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.030 
comes out one end right the other end so
our<00:04:12.700> body<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.390> nothing<00:04:13.750> more<00:04:13.930> than<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.769> juice

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
our body is nothing more than a juice

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.500 
our body is nothing more than a juice
extractor<00:04:15.610> do<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.730> think<00:04:15.909> about<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.299> eat

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
extractor do you think about it we eat

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.860 
extractor do you think about it we eat
solid<00:04:16.930> foods<00:04:17.169> right<00:04:17.859> we<00:04:18.489> out<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.479> incomes

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
solid foods right we out one incomes

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.539 
solid foods right we out one incomes
liquids<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.530> out<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.889> other<00:04:20.919> end<00:04:21.220> comes

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
liquids and out the other end comes

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.080 
liquids and out the other end comes
solids<00:04:21.970> right<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.560> mean<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.010> true<00:04:24.280> it's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
solids right so I mean it's true it's

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.450 
solids right so I mean it's true it's
true<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.660> if<00:04:25.930> we<00:04:26.229> have<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.500> machine<00:04:26.919> do<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
true so if we have the machine do the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.790 
true so if we have the machine do the
processing<00:04:27.850> right<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.780> makes<00:04:29.050> our<00:04:29.260> body<00:04:29.500> not

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
processing right it makes our body not

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.840 
processing right it makes our body not
have<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.310> through<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.550> whole<00:04:30.669> process

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
have to go through that whole process

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.390 
have to go through that whole process
and<00:04:31.750> we'll<00:04:32.290> have<00:04:32.410> more<00:04:32.650> energy<00:04:32.830> because<00:04:33.220> then

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
and we'll have more energy because then

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.250 
and we'll have more energy because then
all<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.699> nutrients<00:04:34.060> will<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.270> readily<00:04:34.990> and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
all the nutrients will be readily and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.070 
all the nutrients will be readily and
easily<00:04:35.290> available<00:04:36.070> for<00:04:36.490> our<00:04:36.639> bodies<00:04:37.030> to

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
easily available for our bodies to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.700 
easily available for our bodies to
assimilate<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:40.210> less<00:04:40.930> energy<00:04:41.410> spent

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
assimilate so less energy spent

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.750 
assimilate so less energy spent
digesting<00:04:42.520> equals<00:04:43.240> more<00:04:43.630> energy<00:04:44.080> for<00:04:44.260> other

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
digesting equals more energy for other

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.650 
digesting equals more energy for other
functions<00:04:45.760> in<00:04:45.850> your<00:04:46.000> body<00:04:46.180> whether<00:04:46.419> it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
functions in your body whether it's

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.560 
functions in your body whether it's
healing<00:04:47.169> or<00:04:47.530> detoxifying<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:48.639> whether<00:04:49.120> it's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
healing or detoxifying or whether it's

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.480 
healing or detoxifying or whether it's
running<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:50.020> 5k<00:04:50.199> marathon<00:04:50.979> whether<00:04:51.280> it's

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
running a 5k marathon whether it's

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.800 
running a 5k marathon whether it's
getting<00:04:51.729> up<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.880> half<00:04:52.030> hour<00:04:52.180> early<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.720> can

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
getting up a half hour early so you can

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.469 
getting up a half hour early so you can
get<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.410> work<00:04:53.680> earlier<00:04:54.100> spend<00:04:54.940> more<00:04:55.180> time<00:04:55.360> with

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
get to work earlier spend more time with

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.939 
get to work earlier spend more time with
your<00:04:55.600> family<00:04:55.930> you're<00:04:56.440> going<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.650> have<00:04:56.740> more

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
your family you're going to have more

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.960 
your family you're going to have more
energy<00:04:57.130> with<00:04:57.580> juicing<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.889> juicing<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.699> good

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
energy with juicing so juicing so good

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.360 
energy with juicing so juicing so good
why<00:05:01.870> not<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.530> know<00:05:02.560> by<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.860> oddball<00:05:03.340> out

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
why not you know by the oddball out

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.890 
why not you know by the oddball out
though<00:05:03.699> that<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:04.030> whole<00:05:04.210> foods<00:05:04.539> or<00:05:04.750> why<00:05:04.840> not

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
though that the whole foods or why not

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.540 
though that the whole foods or why not
buy<00:05:05.169> bottled<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:06.070> know<00:05:06.190> or<00:05:06.340> can<00:05:06.639> juice<00:05:08.550> well

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
buy bottled you know or can juice well

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.580 
buy bottled you know or can juice well
for<00:05:09.760> one<00:05:09.910> thing<00:05:09.940> they<00:05:10.780> cost<00:05:11.050> more<00:05:11.289> money<00:05:11.349> I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
for one thing they cost more money I

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.020 
for one thing they cost more money I
mean<00:05:11.889> I<00:05:12.130> don't<00:05:12.430> know<00:05:12.490> if<00:05:12.580> even<00:05:12.760> know<00:05:12.849> hopefully

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
mean I don't know if even know hopefully

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.460 
mean I don't know if even know hopefully
later<00:05:13.360> there's<00:05:13.599> one<00:05:13.720> across<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.110> parking<00:05:14.380> lot

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
later there's one across the parking lot

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.379 
later there's one across the parking lot
which<00:05:14.650> is<00:05:14.740> kind<00:05:14.919> of<00:05:14.950> nice<00:05:15.099> but<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.789> little<00:05:15.849> olive

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
which is kind of nice but a little olive

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.890 
which is kind of nice but a little olive
juice<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:16.990> five<00:05:17.260> bucks<00:05:17.530> okay<00:05:18.340> come<00:05:18.729> on

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
juice it's like five bucks okay come on

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.050 
juice it's like five bucks okay come on
so<00:05:19.900> much<00:05:20.110> money<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:21.520> other<00:05:21.639> thing<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:21.910> that
