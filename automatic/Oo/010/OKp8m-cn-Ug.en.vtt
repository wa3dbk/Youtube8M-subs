00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 The game against Arminia Bielefeld began 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.309
 with the official adoption of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.830
 outgoing President Hans Kessler 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.360
 Mayor of Darmstadt, Rafael Reiser 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.089
 complimented and handed over a collage 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.810
 five-year-old president 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.720
 time afterwards thomas spengler spoke in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.510
 showing all the fans the words for the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.180
 the games against bielefeld only on 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.180
 accident tour has enabled hans kessler 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 Everything is possible in the people before 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.950
 that together with you a normal 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 to seek first shots and not 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 to begin 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.910
 For five years you can get the contract once 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.910
 removed 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 In the game itself, the lilies have 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.900
 earned three points by arge 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 weaknesses in defensive work 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.960
 in the end it was undeserved 1 3 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 against arminia bielefeld the mood of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.530
 lÃ¤ger first half I found it was 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.369
 already a little bit happy somewhere 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 leadership for us because I believe 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.509
 darmstadt already a bit more from 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.979
 had game and more standards she had 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.649
 then come through the eleven meter 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.580
 guide 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.470
 in the second half, I have to say 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.390
 they came out well that 2012 not 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 such a great hammer but very good before 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.170
 played it out and shoot it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.519
 Anschlussort and everything was on the way 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.930
 that we think the game maybe 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.370
 also turn and as I said we are 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.959
 in the third game of the English week 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 would be really moral and also powerful and 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.360
 shown power that's been there all 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:38.610
 and the contest third gate not mine 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.080
 was that for a still goes to 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.060
 header duel which is completely normal 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650
 will also be extended ball as it is in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.230
 a longer space are one on the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.329
 are also in the majority and a player 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.829
 Armin run in and raises the ball 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.430
 of course, also great about the victory 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.670
 but I mean the third gate is 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.709
 of course, a knockdown 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 why do not we play the things 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.820
 We think to the end because the team 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.860
 think scary offensive and it is 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.090
 of course, on the one hand nice that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 you also play forward that is too 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.570
 my idea 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.489
 you have to end things defensively 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.440
 play because ultimately you always win 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.980
 games about the defensive and the season 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.989
 anyway 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.920
 that is very clear and that is what you have today 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.049
 quite clearly seen that there are so many 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.090
 scenes are not taken too seriously 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.860
 or not quite as perceived 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.840
 as it should be easy but that in 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.570
 the quality question but the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.930
 Team is just like that from home 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:38.430
 as it was set up, I think so only 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.100
 been engaged in the offensive 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 and of course that's a fatal one 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.489
 a fatal circumstance and that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.959
 unfortunately this is an election tactical approach 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 did not work today although you like 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.910
 said many things were done right 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.910
 to have
