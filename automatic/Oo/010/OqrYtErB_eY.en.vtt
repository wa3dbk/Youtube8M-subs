00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 hello and welcome to ocelot strategy 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.970
 we are here in a new interview to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 a player who has joined 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.310
 recently to the multiplayer game 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.560
 from europe universalis 4 we talk about 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.079
 pencil is a pleasure to have you here with 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.430
 we 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.649
 or the mass the pleasure is mine well then 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 as you have seen in the fourth episode 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.030
 from the mp pencil we have already moved away 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.729
 from the bustling European center the player 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 Muscovite lies between the east and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.840
 West at a crossroads between two 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.330
 worlds which actually gives you 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.060
 ample possibilities but good 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.539
 let's move on to the questions and there goes 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.970
 the first come pencil that you could 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.740
 say about the potential that you think that 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.680
 has your nation 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 Well, first of all I think that 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.270
 we have copy is an action with a great 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.890
 terrestrial potential that will try 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.570
 make the most of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.850
 then as you have also commented 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.620
 It has a very strategic position 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.440
 important 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.630
 and also has a great capacity to 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.870
 expansion thanks to that position that 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.030
 he will also try to make the most of 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.430
 very good because we continue with the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.830
 next question what is your opinion 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 about the nations bordering on 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.590
 Muscovy 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 Well, I think I'm lucky 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.159
 surrounding me some nations that are not 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 too powerful 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.099
 perhaps the exception is Lithuania that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.739
 in this game so he has a great 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.409
 power but usually I do not think that I 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.420
 are going to give a lot of problems what I 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.760
 it would facilitate 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.020
 increase my territories than what 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.640
 I hope 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.070
 if the truth is that Lithuania has 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.569
 enough territories and it looks like you're going to 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.450
 have a hard competitor in some way 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.790
 continue with the next question 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.639
 the Muscovite princes were certainly 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.459
 deeply ambitious you as a player 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.019
 also keep and aces ambition 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.960
 you will mark as your goal to raise a 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.020
 powerful czarist russia 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.520
 well then among my main 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.670
 objectives we are converting as already in 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.500
 russia and then with that russia get 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.570
 that is not only a European power 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.350
 but a world power of first 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.860
 order 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.110
 well then we continue after having broken 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.040
 the relationship of vassalage with the hordes 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.780
 Muscovy mongolas started a new stage 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.730
 before so longed for freedom towards where 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.500
 will now look at the Muscovite princes 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.490
 towards east or west 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.440
 well then russia look on both sides the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 preference will be in principle 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.600
 West, which is where we consider 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.830
 are the richest provinces but not 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.980
 let's rule out at any time 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.270
 get closer to the east besides having the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.310
 first idea when I took this country from 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.200
 an idea that a settler gives us as there will be 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.150
 what to take advantage of 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.709
 Well yes you have to take advantage of it because 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.120
 that this law of betting in fact the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.120
 idea of the placed the beech 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.930
 killer of fleet assassin like this 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.030
 good and lastly in the last question 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.720
 the multiplayer game will last between 100 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.459
 and 150 years as you expect it to evolve 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160
 your nation during that period and that the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.580
 ogre you hope you got 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.190
 well then in 100 250 years I imagine 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.990
 a big russia a russia that reaches 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.950
 the gates of austria and the empire 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.830
 Ottoman and a great Russia that can 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.320
 even with large territories in asia 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.500
 that will make it a country to respect and 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.830
 fear and make very taken into account about 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.970
 all 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.529
 russia by definition is usually feared in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.619
 Most of the m3 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.409
 Well, here we leave it, you have already 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.089
 seen that pencil has it very clear is going to 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.819
 try to build an almighty 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:03.949
 Czarist Russia be the envy of many 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.009
 European courts and play their trump card 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.629
 strategic pencil thank you very much for 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.189

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.910
 in the game and for having accessed the
