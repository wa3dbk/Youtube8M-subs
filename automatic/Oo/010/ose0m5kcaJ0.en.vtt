and it looks freaking cool I'd say and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.319 
and it looks freaking cool I'd say and
one<00:00:45.930> thing<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.530> away<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.329> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
one thing I know this right away is it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
one thing I know this right away is it
looks<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.170> replace<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.300> Nazi

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
looks like they did replace the Nazi

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.470 
looks like they did replace the Nazi
symbols<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.100> with<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.399> skull<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
symbols on it with just skull and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
symbols on it with just skull and
crossbones<00:00:55.100> because<00:00:56.100> before<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
crossbones because before there was a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
crossbones because before there was a
Nazi<00:00:57.120> skull<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> bottom<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
Nazi skull down at the bottom or that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
Nazi skull down at the bottom or that
little<00:00:59.129> white<00:00:59.399> skull<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.359> white<00:01:00.510> circle

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
little white skull is the white circle

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.130 
little white skull is the white circle
ended<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.989> at

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
ended up on like about the top there at

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.429 
ended up on like about the top there at
a<00:01:04.199> black<00:01:05.159> circle<00:01:05.400> skull<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.630> used<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
a black circle skull that used to be the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.600 
a black circle skull that used to be the
Nazi<00:01:07.860> SS<00:01:08.220> symbol<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.960> guess<00:01:10.770> someone<00:01:11.220> took

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Nazi SS symbol so I guess someone took

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
Nazi SS symbol so I guess someone took
notice<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.110> dumped<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.200> off<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.650> which<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
notice and dumped it off there which I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
notice and dumped it off there which I
wasn't<00:01:14.640> surprised<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.119> figured<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.540> was

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
wasn't surprised I figured that was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.980 
wasn't surprised I figured that was
probably<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.990> happen<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> actual

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
probably gonna happen as for the actual

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
probably gonna happen as for the actual
figure<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.470> Daryl<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.390> looks

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
figure of Daryl I think it it looks

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
figure of Daryl I think it it looks
really<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> layered<00:01:22.950> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
really good like I like the layered it's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
really good like I like the layered it's
best<00:01:23.939> over<00:01:24.240> top<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> shirt<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.560> looks

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
best over top of this shirt it looks

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.649 
best over top of this shirt it looks
like<00:01:25.890> his<00:01:26.040> legs<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.580> Bend<00:01:26.939> enough<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.450> fit<00:01:27.600> in

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
like his legs will Bend enough to fit in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
like his legs will Bend enough to fit in
a<00:01:27.720> motorcycle<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> mean<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.740> assumed<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
a motorcycle what you mean I assumed it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
a motorcycle what you mean I assumed it
would<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.549> still<00:01:29.850> none<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> other

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
would but still none of the other

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
would but still none of the other
current<00:01:30.689> figures<00:01:31.140> could<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.500> sit<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
current figures could really sit on the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
current figures could really sit on the
motorcycle<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:32.820> their<00:01:33.030> legs<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> don't

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
motorcycle because their legs just don't

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.560 
motorcycle because their legs just don't
bend<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:35.130> obviously<00:01:36.030> since<00:01:36.390> he's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
bend that way but obviously since he's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
bend that way but obviously since he's
come<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.170> made<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.680> could<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
come with it they made it so he could it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
come with it they made it so he could it
looks<00:01:39.000> kind<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> funny<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.840> knee<00:01:40.020> cuz

this is how I always picture Maggie in
these<00:03:46.730> clothes<00:03:47.000> because<00:03:47.299> that's<00:03:47.450> what<00:03:47.600> she

because I like those clothes pretty cool

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920

and this looks like they don't shower
acessories<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.579> picture<00:03:58.940> no<00:03:59.239> why

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
acessories in this picture no why

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.960 
acessories in this picture no why
sure<00:04:00.470> she'll<00:04:00.709> come<00:04:00.829> with<00:04:01.040> their<00:04:01.190> knife<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.730> a

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
sure she'll come with their knife and a

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.520 
sure she'll come with their knife and a
gun<00:04:02.510> or<00:04:02.930> something

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
gun or something

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.060 
gun or something
but<00:04:04.459> yep<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.150> think<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.140> face<00:04:06.320> looks<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.739> her

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
but yep I think the face looks like her

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.500 
but yep I think the face looks like her
not<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.370> think<00:04:07.670> Glenn<00:04:07.910> looks<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.150> little<00:04:08.239> closer

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
not I think Glenn looks a little closer

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.060 
not I think Glenn looks a little closer
but<00:04:08.750> this<00:04:08.930> still<00:04:09.110> looked<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.410> lot<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.620> Maggie

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
but this still looked a lot like Maggie

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.940 
but this still looked a lot like Maggie
it's<00:04:10.940> pretty<00:04:11.180> close<00:04:11.329> I<00:04:11.690> mean<00:04:12.170> they<00:04:12.350> are<00:04:12.470> skins

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
it's pretty close I mean they are skins

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.220 
it's pretty close I mean they are skins
so<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.370> should<00:04:13.579> look<00:04:13.610> pretty<00:04:13.760> close<00:04:14.299> but<00:04:14.660> still

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
so it should look pretty close but still

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.770 
so it should look pretty close but still
sometimes<00:04:16.100> they<00:04:16.190> don't<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:17.150> got<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.510> Merle

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
sometimes they don't and got the Merle

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.900 
sometimes they don't and got the Merle
zombie<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.829> looks<00:04:19.010> like<00:04:19.100> it's<00:04:19.430> a

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
zombie and it looks like it's a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.490 
zombie and it looks like it's a
different<00:04:20.060> sculpted<00:04:20.630> head<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.780> was<00:04:21.049> hoping<00:04:21.320> it

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
different sculpted head I was hoping it

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.230 
different sculpted head I was hoping it
would<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:21.950> I'm<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.820> than<00:04:23.120> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
would be because I'm just one than the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.760 
would be because I'm just one than the
paint<00:04:23.510> of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
paint of

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.980 
paint of
and<00:04:24.069> stuff<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.370> there<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:25.419> he's<00:04:25.539> got<00:04:25.780> the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
and stuff on there then he's got the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.439 
and stuff on there then he's got the
wound<00:04:26.379> on<00:04:26.590> his<00:04:26.710> chest<00:04:27.069> painted<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:28.060> not

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
wound on his chest painted in I'm not

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.710 
wound on his chest painted in I'm not
sure<00:04:28.960> can't<00:04:29.379> tell<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.800> there<00:04:29.979> was<00:04:30.069> actually

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
sure can't tell if there was actually

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.029 
sure can't tell if there was actually
like<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> sculpted<00:04:32.259> and<00:04:32.379> hole<00:04:32.530> there<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.889> looks

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
like a sculpted and hole there it looks

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.659

it's<00:05:11.319> not<00:05:11.409> a<00:05:11.470> very<00:05:11.650> good<00:05:11.740> picture<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.190> him<00:05:12.400> I

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
it's not a very good picture of him I

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.110 
it's not a very good picture of him I
don't<00:05:13.690> know<00:05:13.810> if<00:05:13.870> he's<00:05:13.960> finished<00:05:14.319> here<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.650> what

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
don't know if he's finished here on what

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.580 
don't know if he's finished here on what
but<00:05:16.120> he's<00:05:16.300> pretty<00:05:16.569> plain<00:05:16.870> I<00:05:16.900> mean<00:05:17.229> there

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
but he's pretty plain I mean there

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.140 
but he's pretty plain I mean there
wasn't<00:05:17.860> much<00:05:17.979> color<00:05:18.219> to<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.490> guy<00:05:18.639> in<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:18.969> show

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
wasn't much color to the guy in the show

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.909 
wasn't much color to the guy in the show
because<00:05:19.300> he<00:05:19.509> was<00:05:19.630> just<00:05:19.719> charred<00:05:20.349> up<00:05:20.500> body<00:05:20.740> in

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
because he was just charred up body in

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:21.990 
because he was just charred up body in
here<00:05:21.009> there's<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.310> little<00:05:21.400> bit<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:21.610> blood<00:05:21.849> on

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
here there's a little bit of blood on

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.800 
here there's a little bit of blood on
him<00:05:22.120> but<00:05:22.620> still<00:05:23.620> it's<00:05:24.490> hard<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.759> tell<00:05:24.969> how<00:05:25.750> good

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
him but still it's hard to tell how good

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.719 
him but still it's hard to tell how good
that<00:05:26.169> one<00:05:26.289> looks<00:05:26.500> even<00:05:27.190> with<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.490> picture<00:05:28.409> so
