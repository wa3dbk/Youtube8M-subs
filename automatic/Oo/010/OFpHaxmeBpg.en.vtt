 Lock card action abilities of defense rice on burst deathblow fireable at 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 If you make it an attacker, attack the enemy who made the lock on and keep the guard of that enemy during the round 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.270
 It can only increase the damage to the enemy at the time of the special move activation that is only one year. 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270
 You 're a burst person 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.570

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:03.250
 jm 4 steps village country g 1 more power than a campaign 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.760
 Even though it is 1000 points higher, it is 10 times more 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:14.200
 The same factor with the same spirit 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.200
 A block conversion of your own new incense avatar and bedding and 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.659
 Well I get into it, but I get both 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.620

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 It is above 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.040
 myself 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.270
 It is love I can not grasp 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.990
 When you say that or not why used and referred to as what he is not 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.190
 Though round and round and has been round and round from a little while ago 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.760
 Yeah it's What berserker type 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.030
 As you all know 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.500
 Well myself 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 The fact that going to the attack from there the guard to 1 and Well lock on Well in the first 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.460
 so 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.630
 Hmm 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.840
 But Berserker type is the last 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.850
 Yup 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.970
 Though it is so at the time of cooperation 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.970
 It will be the last, but generally 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:25.470
 It is a Berserker to attack at the end even when attacking with that belly graph, isn't it? 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.950
 In return 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.230

 jm 4 bullets campaign village kunijiri here 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 The reit type is the first to lock on you 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.490
 With this difference single hardship conversion 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.960
 If you are still in progress here is a little bit of this ability 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:54.720
 It here though is that so also march, et al. 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.800
 I can not enter it, I have no chance to use this 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800
 Because I do not faint 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:09.799
 Even if I fainted, I wish I could use the old page of the page I'm using and romance 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.250
 I think I'm a bad compatibility Nde there have one much-valued line N 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.440
 Because 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.790
 Through to guard position 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.230
 That it has further the burst exchange matching 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.459
 Well after I'm Only The effect of this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.459
 10 times turtles wave 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 It 's right here 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.920
 Starter set trunks dd prom 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.629
 There beyond the museum just for this necessary energy in the way of I do one kill 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.069
 The second place this place is Shinko avatar and single blow conversion 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.440
 Can be used with 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:56.100
 Good sprouting of trunks gt pro 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:00.670
 One Kill stunned not time You can also use it You're Well So the other day that selectively used to 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:04.270
 We the Lowdown have let me hope 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.580
 It is this elite type 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:13.990
 And here is Berserka yes 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:17.280
 I really think this is the kind of thing that really depends on the deck. 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:25.400
 The problem is that it is a Berserker 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:27.150
 I think that it will change depending on the convenience of the cycle due to the configuration of the deck 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.139
 After all 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.949
 Route type 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.949
 I like
