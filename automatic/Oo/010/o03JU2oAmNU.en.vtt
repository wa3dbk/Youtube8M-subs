00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 how 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.680
 hello how about friends of tucson actually 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.320
 is a tutorial of an application that we 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.580
 will allow to hack or modify the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.580
 games 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.460
 modify I mean score to score 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.380
 that will give us each game this 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.140
 application will not allow us to alter 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.440
 being root obviously you have to be root 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.820
 to modify that is the serial number 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 that brings that game then the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.460
 application is called game and the apk is not 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 gives them the same page since 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.600
 the application is a few months ago and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.660
 we found the place thor but the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.520
 erased for the same as it owns is 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.150
 something that does not 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.150
 nole 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 he left the word did not suit him what 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.450
 loop and have this application 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 well then this is going to open the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.190
 once open application is going to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 get out this and well do not do anything 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 more but press the home button 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.770
 from the top we will come out 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 East - West 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 that neighborhood status would say good I'm going 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.400
 to move down and if I'm already hidden 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.280
 but it's still here with a 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.760
 there you can see it is colored 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.680
 Gray we only take it out but only 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
 the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.500
 we touch it and then it goes well 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 here do quickly move it to 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.130
 down 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.140
 with these two sides of here 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.530
 I like to have it lower than above 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.149
 then we're going to hide it and we're going to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.909
 open a game they realize here by the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.280
 part of here below comes out and good 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.830
 we go in a game I have all these 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.320
 what do you think if we play two jump 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.230
 an excessively funny game 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.740
 so 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.740
 are 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.560
 good one will play a round to see how 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.269
 we are then I am not going to play it such 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 which is only for 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.549
 show them that if it works and I want to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.549
 kill 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.250
 It can not be when I do not want an eternal 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.250
 game there is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.620
 country is hard to kill yourself then 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.660
 us what we have to do here 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 in the score obviously is that first 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.510
 conversions to cut the video then 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.849
 are to follow is to be interrupted 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.620
 then let's continue here we have to 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:51.830
 It gives us a normal score of 786 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.410
 the top part we can not see 7 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.049
 86 then what we have to do is 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.209
 take the bar down here and give it to 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.520
 the option of the lupita that is a magnifying glass 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.710
 normal we give to that option 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.590
 there will come out that we give the option 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.690
 that says inputs name there we 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.720
 we have to type the number of our 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.770
 score that is 786 let's type what 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.770
 786 and we can see it 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.370
 there it is then we want 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.370
 stay ok 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.660
 Ivan and start looking in the game 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.400
 in the game 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.130
 they always realize that almost always 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.190
 is the first option that is the good one that 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:48.520
 says of ojotas that is Don don Julian 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.210
 score 786 then that 's the one that we 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.980
 interesting if something comes up with another because it 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.550
 they give account down here there are other numbers 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.350
 with 786 but it does not say anything it concluded 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.130
 so I always go for the first 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.950
 option then I will give you that option 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.050
 and he tells me that what I want him with what 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.730
 number I want to put to modify it myself 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.660
 I will put for example a number which 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.720
 they have stayed, wait for me 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.200
 I am going to give you here for example a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:28.220
 number that if the modified 51 80 96 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.440
 37 42 102 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.529
 Aisha had already run out 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.559
 only then I think 10 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.779
 today is I put that number only you 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:41.209
 I have to give the option ok in this part 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:44.289
 from here ok and the option that says 

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:46.389
 modify to notify 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.689
 we give you the option that says very difficult 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.249
 and it's going to come out again so we give it 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.249
 the option back 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.500
 and good that apparently not not the least 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:04.069
 served here no longer served let's go back 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:09.620
 to do is that that's the number we're going to 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:12.650
 modify it by 111 modify 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.449
 and there is this if it did not work and it is that 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.689
 we have it 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.330
 series numbers something difficult to memorize 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.419
 then we see that here already if not 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.030
 modified 1 1 1 1 4 1 let's go back to 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.000
 do to see that no 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.720
 and nothing then let's give it here another 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.270
 time we will give change as pay him 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:41.400
 999 00 5 we give you ok and modify 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.250
 and there he is going he modified them if they are given 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.380
 account 9 9 005 I here are no longer like 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.270
 905 and for example if we want to be a 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.160
 screen capture and that our friends 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.230
 hesitation to our friends and not 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.650
 realize that we have this little picture of 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.410
 here only we give him there again 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.480
 we give the option to configure and we give 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.500
 the option that says 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.900
 Stop game and realize there is nothing 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.840
 no trace of game and only 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.530
 we do screen capture and good and we 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.180
 We left the two menus behind and it's good 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.950
 this application will find you here 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.110
 below in the description of this video 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.850
 Until next time I hope you have 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.590
 liked like in the online video that the 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.330
 facebook page that the link will be 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.250
 down here just like the application 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.380
 only download one install the 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.920
 open and do these steps until the 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.920
 next
