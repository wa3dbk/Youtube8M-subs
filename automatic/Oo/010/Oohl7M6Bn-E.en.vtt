pretty interesting stuff though but
let's<00:00:51.780> move<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.699> thoughts<00:00:53.940> are

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
let's move on so what thoughts are

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.689 
let's move on so what thoughts are
basically<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> let<00:00:56.070> me<00:00:56.129> give<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> some<00:00:56.550> more

basically that let me give you some more
information<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.329> apparently<00:00:57.840> they're<00:00:58.050> in

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
information so apparently they're in

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
information so apparently they're in
this<00:00:58.469> article<00:00:58.770> there's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> blu-ray<00:00:59.670> disc

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
this article there's a blu-ray disc

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.229 
this article there's a blu-ray disc
drive<00:01:00.149> there's<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.469> voice<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> tablet

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
drive there's also a voice and tablet

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.080 
drive there's also a voice and tablet
integration<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> voice<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> of

integration now the voice would be of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
integration now the voice would be of
course<00:01:06.150> connect<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> makes<00:01:07.710> sense<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
course connect so that makes sense the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
course connect so that makes sense the
other<00:01:08.400> cool<00:01:08.670> feature<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.600> feel

you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.869> cloud-based<00:01:25.200> service<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you know cloud-based service which is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
you know cloud-based service which is
kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.090> their<00:01:27.390> i<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
kind of their i have that but it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
kind of their i have that but it's
obviously<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.820> refined<00:01:30.240> i<00:01:30.390> would

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
obviously more more refined i would

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
obviously more more refined i would
imagine<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.280> doesn't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
imagine this is what I don't doesn't

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
imagine this is what I don't doesn't
make<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.030> sense<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> me<00:01:33.360> though<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
make any sense to me though is the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.460 
make any sense to me though is the
upgraded<00:01:34.590> hardware<00:01:35.570> or<00:01:36.570> no<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> upgrade

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
upgraded hardware or no need to upgrade

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
upgraded hardware or no need to upgrade
your<00:01:37.680> hardware<00:01:38.250> ever<00:01:38.490> again<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.060> doesn't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
your hardware ever again that doesn't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
your hardware ever again that doesn't
make<00:01:39.990> any<00:01:40.170> sense<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.890> whatsoever<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.700> don't

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
make any sense to me whatsoever I don't

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
make any sense to me whatsoever I don't
know<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:42.930> gonna<00:01:43.560> even<00:01:43.920> happen<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
know how that's gonna even happen but it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
know how that's gonna even happen but it
was<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.720> guess<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.229> article<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.920> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
was I guess in this article that it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.600 
was I guess in this article that it's
gonna<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.840> five<00:01:49.380> year<00:01:49.590> plan<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> Microsoft

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
gonna be a five year plan that Microsoft

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600 
gonna be a five year plan that Microsoft
has<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.210> makes<00:01:51.420> sense<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.320> 299<00:01:52.950> price<00:01:53.310> point

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
has that makes sense the 299 price point

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
has that makes sense the 299 price point
seems<00:01:53.909> pretty<00:01:54.149> fair<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:56.070> only<00:01:56.189> thing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
seems pretty fair and the only thing
