hi<00:00:05.160> guys<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.760> is<00:00:05.819> cinema<00:00:06.390> 4d<00:00:06.689> tutorials<00:00:07.500> and

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hi guys this is cinema 4d tutorials and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.860 
hi guys this is cinema 4d tutorials and
in<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.130> tutorial<00:00:08.340> I'm<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.480> showing

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.020 
in this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:10.260> how<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.679> use<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> wind<00:00:13.019> effect<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:14.129> cinema

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you how to use the wind effect on cinema

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.800 
you how to use the wind effect on cinema
4d<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:16.460> basically<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> wind<00:00:18.119> effect<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
4d and basically what the wind effect is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
4d and basically what the wind effect is
it<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.460> applied<00:00:20.849> to<00:00:21.300> any<00:00:21.750> object<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:23.090> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it can be applied to any object and it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
it can be applied to any object and it
basically<00:00:24.650> makes<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.980> look<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.789> wind<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
basically makes it look like the wind is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.490 
basically makes it look like the wind is
blowing<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> yeah<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> wind

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
blowing it so yeah that's what the wind

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
blowing it so yeah that's what the wind
effect<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:32.009> you'll<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> looks<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.960> we

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
effect is you'll see how it looks as we

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.709 
effect is you'll see how it looks as we
progress<00:00:34.830> into<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.640> disc<00:00:35.879> to<00:00:36.059> toriel

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
progress into the disc to toriel

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410 
progress into the disc to toriel
so<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.649> first<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.250> by<00:00:38.430> opening<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.969> cinema

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so we first start by opening up cinema

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.920 
so we first start by opening up cinema
4d

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
4d

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.150 
4d
and<00:00:40.399> you<00:00:41.399> highlight<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.620> panel<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and you highlight this panel and you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.910 
and you highlight this panel and you
select<00:00:44.489> plain<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.800> change<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
select plain and you change the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
select plain and you change the
orientation<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> plane<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.960> plus<00:00:49.440> Z<00:00:51.140> let's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
orientation of the plane to plus Z let's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.910 
orientation of the plane to plus Z let's
move<00:00:52.410> tau<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> plane<00:00:55.350> nice<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
move tau and to make the plane nice and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.450 
move tau and to make the plane nice and
wide<00:00:56.190> let's<00:00:57.149> change<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.750> width<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.160> plane

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wide let's change the width of the plane

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.240 
wide let's change the width of the plane
to<00:01:00.140> 750<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.760> leave<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.030> high<00:01:03.179> alone<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> now

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to 750 and leave the high alone so now

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.960 
to 750 and leave the high alone so now
we<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> nice<00:01:05.960> wide<00:01:06.960> plane<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> wind

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we have a nice wide plane for the wind

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
we have a nice wide plane for the wind
to<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.869> applied<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.540> apply<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> wind

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to be applied to and to apply the wind

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.179 
to be applied to and to apply the wind
you<00:01:13.790> select<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.030> plane<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.830> panel

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you select this plane and this panel

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.630 
you select this plane and this panel
sorry<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> select<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.840> wind<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> then

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
sorry and you select the wind and then

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
sorry and you select the wind and then
you<00:01:20.790> make<00:01:21.000> drag<00:01:21.659> wind<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.829> plane<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.650> once

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you make drag wind into plane and once

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.210 
you make drag wind into plane and once
you<00:01:25.829> do<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.920> shape<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you do that you can see the shape of the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.410 
you do that you can see the shape of the
plane<00:01:29.640> changes<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.520> it's<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> wind<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
plane changes and it's like the wind is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.999 
plane changes and it's like the wind is
blowing<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
blowing it but as you can see it's

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
blowing it but as you can see it's
stationary<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.149> not<00:01:39.360> moving

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
stationary as in it's not moving

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.249 
stationary as in it's not moving
anywhere<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> move<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
anywhere and we want it to move so it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.700 
anywhere and we want it to move so it
really<00:01:43.500> looks<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.340> wind<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.700> blowing<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
really looks like the wind is blowing it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.670 
really looks like the wind is blowing it
so<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.610> animation<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.689> select

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
so to do this animation you select

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 
so to do this animation you select
automatic<00:01:50.520> click<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> automatic<00:01:51.770> keyframing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
automatic click on automatic keyframing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.280 
automatic click on automatic keyframing
and<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:55.020> drag<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.460> green<00:01:57.090> screen<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:57.930> as

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and you drag the green screen to now as

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
and you drag the green screen to now as
you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.250> moves<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.759> bit<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.740> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you can see it moves a bit but to really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.999 
you can see it moves a bit but to really
make<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.369> move<00:02:02.789> you<00:02:03.060> change<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.750> amplitude

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
make it move you change the amplitude

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.660 
make it move you change the amplitude
and<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> size<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.660> wind<00:02:10.400> so<00:02:11.400> let's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and the size of the of the wind so let's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.839 
and the size of the of the wind so let's
make<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.270> double<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.410> 100

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
make that double it to 100

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.699 
make that double it to 100
and<00:02:16.519> let's<00:02:17.519> make<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.749> on<00:02:18.959> Jan<00:02:19.290> 20<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:21.709> also

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and let's make this on Jan 20 and also

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.879 
and let's make this on Jan 20 and also
you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
you

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.000 
you
I<00:02:23.010> guess<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:24.200> increase<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.620> frequency

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
I guess you can increase the frequency

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.330 
I guess you can increase the frequency
as<00:02:26.549> well<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.090> make<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:28.319> make<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
as well to make it to make more of the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.770 
as well to make it to make more of the
these<00:02:30.090> bends<00:02:30.569> over<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:32.659> increasing<00:02:33.659> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
these bends over here increasing the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.920 
these bends over here increasing the
frequency<00:02:33.930> increases<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.579> bends<00:02:35.849> shown<00:02:36.420> into

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
frequency increases the bends shown into

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.330 
frequency increases the bends shown into
the<00:02:37.230> claim<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> let's<00:02:39.420> put<00:02:40.669> roundabout<00:02:41.669> five

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the claim so let's put roundabout five

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.530 
the claim so let's put roundabout five
and<00:02:45.560> once<00:02:46.560> that's<00:02:46.829> done<00:02:47.010> once<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.909> change<00:02:48.239> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and once that's done once you change it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.619 
and once that's done once you change it
as<00:02:49.219> you<00:02:50.219> can<00:02:50.609> see<00:02:50.849> once<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.329> drag

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
as you can see once the what you drag

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.879 
as you can see once the what you drag
the<00:02:54.900> green<00:02:55.109> square<00:02:55.590> around<00:02:55.919> it<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.889> plane

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
the green square around it the plane

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.550 
the green square around it the plane
changes<00:02:59.579> shape<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.719> looks<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.169> the<00:03:01.349> wind

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
changes shape and it looks like the wind

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.670 
changes shape and it looks like the wind
is<00:03:01.739> blowing<00:03:01.949> it<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:03.299> let's<00:03:03.540> select<00:03:03.780> click<00:03:04.500> on

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
is blowing it so let's select click on

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.580 
is blowing it so let's select click on
play<00:03:04.919> see<00:03:05.459> how<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.790> looks<00:03:06.060> as<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.379> see

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
play see how that looks as you can see

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.170 
play see how that looks as you can see
it's<00:03:07.769> really<00:03:08.310> nice<00:03:09.079> smooth<00:03:10.079> effect<00:03:10.680> on

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it's really nice smooth effect on

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.199 
it's really nice smooth effect on
objects<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.590> although<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.699> 2d

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
objects and although this was a 2d

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.280 
objects and although this was a 2d
object<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.930> could<00:03:16.079> also<00:03:16.379> be<00:03:16.680> applied<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:18.290> 3d

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
object it could also be applied to 3d

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.559 
object it could also be applied to 3d
objects<00:03:19.799> too<00:03:20.009> I<00:03:20.280> could<00:03:20.790> quickly<00:03:21.269> show<00:03:21.509> you

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
objects too I could quickly show you

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.759 
objects too I could quickly show you
know<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.069> window<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:27.620> delete<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
know just like the window and delete the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.210 
know just like the window and delete the
plane<00:03:29.009> and<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.669> you<00:03:29.970> want<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.389> add<00:03:31.009> the<00:03:32.009> wind

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
plane and if you want to add the wind

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.830 
plane and if you want to add the wind
effect<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> cube<00:03:33.930> for<00:03:34.650> example<00:03:35.599> drag<00:03:36.599> the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
effect to a cube for example drag the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.749 
effect to a cube for example drag the
wing<00:03:37.019> into<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.620> cube<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.560> wind<00:03:40.799> also<00:03:43.159> has<00:03:44.159> the

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
wing into the cube the wind also has the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:52.939 
wing into the cube the wind also has the
same<00:03:45.180> effect<00:03:50.060> although<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.560> better<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.799> be

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
same effect although it's better to be

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.210 
same effect although it's better to be
applied<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.489> 2d<00:03:53.970> objects<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.900> my<00:03:55.500> experience

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
applied to 2d objects in my experience

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.649 
applied to 2d objects in my experience
as<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:57.449> wind<00:03:57.659> looks<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.169> lot<00:03:58.469> better<00:03:58.829> than<00:03:59.659> if

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
as the wind looks a lot better than if

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.300 
as the wind looks a lot better than if
it's<00:04:01.019> applied<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> 3d<00:04:02.459> objects<00:04:02.939> and<00:04:03.829> so<00:04:04.829> this

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it's applied to 3d objects and so this

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.009 
it's applied to 3d objects and so this
was<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.939> tutorial<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.840> how<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.519> add<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.780> wind

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
was the tutorial of how to add the wind

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.149 
was the tutorial of how to add the wind
effect<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:11.099> objects<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:12.169> hope<00:04:13.169> you<00:04:13.439> enjoyed<00:04:13.829> it

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
effect to objects I hope you enjoyed it

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.719 
effect to objects I hope you enjoyed it
I<00:04:14.400> hope<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:15.569> learned<00:04:15.840> from<00:04:16.469> it<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.639> have
