coefficient of wet ice on wet ice and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.880 
coefficient of wet ice on wet ice and
it's<00:01:34.550> naturally<00:01:35.060> self<00:01:35.330> lubricating<00:01:35.890> surface

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it's naturally self lubricating surface

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's naturally self lubricating surface
finish<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.190> still<00:01:37.550> important<00:01:38.120> on<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.420> though

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
finish is still important on it though

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.710 
finish is still important on it though
if<00:01:38.750> they<00:01:38.870> have<00:01:39.020> rough<00:01:39.290> spots<00:01:39.650> dull<00:01:39.950> spots

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
if they have rough spots dull spots

if they have rough spots dull spots
things<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.020> nature<00:01:42.080> it's<00:01:42.920> still<00:01:43.220> about

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
things of that nature it's still about

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.370 
things of that nature it's still about
like<00:01:43.580> putting<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.970> rough<00:01:44.210> piece<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.659> titanium

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
like putting a rough piece of titanium

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.320 
like putting a rough piece of titanium
in<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.920> could<00:01:46.340> be<00:01:46.460> machined<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.120> could<00:01:47.210> be

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
in you it could be machined it could be

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.770 
in you it could be machined it could be
drilled<00:01:47.690> tapped<00:01:49.270> manipulated<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.390> just<00:01:50.570> about

worn long-term and it actually does have

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.420 
worn long-term and it actually does have

is acrylic standard old industrial grade

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.990 
is acrylic standard old industrial grade
acrylic<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.960> looks<00:02:06.710> kind<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.070> cool<00:02:07.340> almost

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
acrylic it looks kind of cool almost

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.680 
acrylic it looks kind of cool almost
like<00:02:08.179> glass<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> difference<00:02:10.690> it's

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
like glass but know the difference it's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.410 
like glass but know the difference it's
not<00:02:11.900> autoclave<00:02:12.470> able<00:02:13.269> scratches<00:02:14.269> easily<00:02:16.420> it's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
not autoclave able scratches easily it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.600 
not autoclave able scratches easily it's
popular<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.200> 90s<00:02:18.620> before<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.220> knew<00:02:19.430> any

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
popular in the 90s before we knew any

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.750 
popular in the 90s before we knew any
