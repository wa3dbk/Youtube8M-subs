00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.090
 to 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.780
 two 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.010
 very good people, how are you? 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.950
 take and well then in this video to 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.290
 bring a lot of information 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.050
 interesting about a new new dlc that 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.939
 supposedly leaked a hacker and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 good you will have the post in the description 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.220
 so well I'll start to explain 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.770
 everything that will contain the new 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.380
 vehicles and quite a few other things that 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.960
 can contain this new voucher 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 update would have a similar name 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 at low it is low, since we have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 had the dirty money update 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.160
 that supposedly was for rich people 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 then low will be an update on 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.970
 suppose it will be for people who do not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.590
 have so much money worth let's say the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.240
 hacker compares it with the update 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.180
 hippie with the news of a hippie now 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.620
 you know we have not then there was no 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 spend a lot of money to buy the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.589
 vehicles and such and such guys the hacker 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.470
 It has also leaked several cars 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.150
 worth 12 cars exactly worth and good 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 I will explain them below 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 as you see the first two codes are 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 faction two and faction three the faction is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.630
 a car that was already there 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 dt to bali but non gta 5 but I think 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is from gta 4 even from gta san 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.950
 andreas I'm not 100% sure and good 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.890
 it's a car that surely remastered 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.050
 and put it in gta on the new axis 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.730
 is 5 when they release the version 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.480
 it's worth the next update that 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.500
 surely this is 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.660
 more the moonbeam is worth the moving 2 is a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.720
 van that has been in all 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.150
 the gta if I remember correctly I think so 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.840
 who has been in all the gta 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.880
 practically in all I do not know well 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.580
 prior to san andreas has been know 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.740
 that in san andreas and in gta 4 yes that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.990
 it was so in gta 5 I could not miss 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 this van and good 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.370
 a next car is worth cousin 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.140
 2 the cousin is already in gta vale yes badly 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.420
 I remember that yes they are already gta 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.090
 here you have the photo is valid for you to see 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.240
 that is already in gta iv nothing simply 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.770
 it would be a remastering by changing something 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 some new feature in any 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.480
 thing then we have a code totally 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 again it's worth it since that vehicle has not 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.560
 been in no gta so it's a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 totally new vehicle then we have 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.620
 the video 2 and the video 3 the game is a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.840
 car that is already in gta 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.489
 they will remasterize in some way 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.930
 and somehow we do not know which one 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.700
 it is obviously can put any 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.400
 new modification or any of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.709
 new structure whatever 'the Chinese' 2 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 It's worth as you are seeing the Chinese 2 the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.760
 Chinese you already know that the last one came out 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.280
 update the ba pete but this 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.349
 car is already in gta it is worth the hacker 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.390
 do not know if they are going to get a version with 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 rust or it's going to be a clean version like 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.690
 You see voodoo and do not know if they are 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.150
 going to the climb north version of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.830
 wood um that is let's say he does not know if 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.840
 they are going to put an update with rust 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.680
 in the next acts and next 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.660
 update they are going to put 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.269
 remastered with oxide like lime in 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.670
 rusty revel that we have for example or 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.980
 if they are going to put it clean, it's worth 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.720
 last well then another good then we have 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.640
 another code that is another vehicle 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.129
 totally new then we have the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.260
 tornado I say that the tornado is a car 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.110
 that we already have the tornado class worth 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.950
 there are several types the mariachi the normal 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.739
 the rusted the convertible and I do not know if 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.590
 there's another one that I do not know what it is but 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.870
 well there are four already in gta 5 already for 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 bored and also another more 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.659
 and well the other vehicle that we do not have 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.849
 data from him so it's not worth it 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.890
 our gta there is no gta so 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.940
 they will put it from scratch 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.099
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.810

 these vehicles and such if all this goes to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.500
 be true and such is a hacker that the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.930
 truth that gives enough confidence because 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.650
 has already taken out a lot of things and has 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.530
 then accepted accepted to hit 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.030
