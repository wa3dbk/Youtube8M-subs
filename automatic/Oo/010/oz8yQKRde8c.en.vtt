00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
online yet to see these tests because I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.360 
online yet to see these tests because I
had<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.950> had<00:00:41.520> lost<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> baby<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.570> Joe<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.370> lost

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
had I had lost the baby I Joe and I lost

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.410 
had I had lost the baby I Joe and I lost
the<00:00:44.520> baby<00:00:44.719> not<00:00:45.719> even<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.020> year<00:00:46.200> ago<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.420> then

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the baby not even a year ago and then

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
the baby not even a year ago and then
right<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.559> grandpa<00:00:49.950> passed<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
right before that my grandpa passed and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
right before that my grandpa passed and
so<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.309> lost<00:00:53.430> their<00:00:53.670> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so then you know after I lost their you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.959 
so then you know after I lost their you
had<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> heart<00:00:54.090> attack<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:55.230> guess<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
had a heart attack and I guess when you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
had a heart attack and I guess when you
have<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> spontaneous<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:57.960> call<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
have a spontaneous they call what a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.979 
have a spontaneous they call what a
spontaneous<00:00:58.859> abortion<00:00:59.579> which<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.180> don't

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
spontaneous abortion which I don't

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
spontaneous abortion which I don't
believe<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.440> abortion<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.850> they

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
believe in abortion but that's what they

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.070 
believe in abortion but that's what they
call<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.930> lose<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> baby<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
call it when you lose a baby that is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.740 
call it when you lose a baby that is
like<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> huge<00:01:07.380> sign<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.920> someone<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.640> young

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
like a huge sign for someone so young

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.399 
like a huge sign for someone so young
like<00:01:09.750> 34

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.590 

that<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:14.579> have<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.759> heart<00:01:14.909> attack<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that has could have a heart attack so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.130 
that has could have a heart attack so

looked pretty good a good sinus rhythm

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.350 
looked pretty good a good sinus rhythm
going

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.200 

actually<00:02:11.140> did<00:02:11.320> really<00:02:11.350> mean<00:02:12.100> much<00:02:12.730> better

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
actually did really mean much better

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.960 
actually did really mean much better
than<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.050> thought<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.830> would<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.430> took<00:02:15.640> three

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
than I thought I would do it took three

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.660 
than I thought I would do it took three
out<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.300> an<00:02:16.450> which<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.990> six<00:02:17.200> milligrams<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:21.490> get

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
out of an which is six milligrams to get

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.020 
out of an which is six milligrams to get
this<00:02:21.790> done

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.559 

I<00:02:25.150> thought<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.810> will<00:02:25.990> only<00:02:26.050> take<00:02:26.200> two<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.640> out

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
I thought it will only take two to out

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.750 
I thought it will only take two to out
of<00:02:28.780> anguish<00:02:29.050> before<00:02:29.470> milligrams<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:32.760> I'm

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
of anguish before milligrams but I'm

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.880 
of anguish before milligrams but I'm
worn<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.209> I'm<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.350> hereafter<00:02:35.920> bed<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.730> i

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
worn out I'm I know hereafter bed and i

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.220 
worn out I'm I know hereafter bed and i
will<00:02:38.890> crash<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.670> mean<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.480> going<00:02:41.080> out<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
will crash I mean because going out I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.900 
will crash I mean because going out I
get<00:02:41.620> worked<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.370> stuff<00:02:42.550> like<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
get worked up and stuff like that and
