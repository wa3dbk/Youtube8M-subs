mysterio now the match overall was good
but<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.820> guess<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.509> thought<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.840> was<00:02:02.930> boring

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
but I guess I thought it was boring

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.550 
but I guess I thought it was boring
because<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:05.030> was<00:02:05.450> raining<00:02:05.869> for<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.140> your<00:02:06.259> ticket

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
because I was raining for on your ticket

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.919 
because I was raining for on your ticket
or<00:02:06.649> return<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.549> normally<00:02:08.209> when<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.479> wait<00:02:08.660> for

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
or return and normally when you wait for

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.110 
or return and normally when you wait for
something<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.259> happen<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:10.100> not<00:02:10.670> ecstatic

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
something to happen it's not ecstatic

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360 
something to happen it's not ecstatic
sighting<00:02:11.810> normally<00:02:12.709> when<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.950> wait<00:02:13.160> for

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
sighting normally when you wait for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.530 
sighting normally when you wait for
something<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.880> kind<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.720> boring<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:16.540> maybe

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
something it's kind of boring so maybe

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.090 
something it's kind of boring so maybe
that's<00:02:17.690> why<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> thought<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.200> was<00:02:18.290> boring<00:02:18.650> but
