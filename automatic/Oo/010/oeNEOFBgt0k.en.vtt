00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.290
 Hello 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.040
 well apparently our minion here 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.890
 wants to eat a delicious cupcake and 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.490
 all alone but good today 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.230
 we will make our mini plush and if 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.739
 you want to get yours I invite you to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.700
 be able to follow the steps in this video 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:43.400
 they have the body in rectangular shape 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.460
 wide so I have cut two pieces of 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.810
 yellow color of wide felt fabric 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.660
 and I will proceed to 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.540
 or be a needle and thread of the same color 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.640
 of the fabric around the contour without 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:22.869
 forget to leave a space to be able 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:26.229
 enter and start after finishing 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.900
 to bake the entire edge let's flip 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.050
 the face by the side that we have left 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.330
 open so that in this way all the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.290
 Seam is inside and outside of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 The stitching looks good 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:02:05.670
 now we put enough stuffing in the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:08.119
 body of my mind then I made her her 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 little arms that are rectangular 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 thin ones have a cut as you can see 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.500
 and I will proceed then to sew everything to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.500
 flip it and also fix 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.400
 here I have finished the little arms and 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.640
 They are stuffed and they are also cooked 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.540
 and this is the way they will go to each 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.540
 body side 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.310
 here I have cut as you can see what 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.670
 what would be the handyman 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.520
 it would be black felt in fact two 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.680
 pieces and I've attached them with silicone 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.290
 hot and part of 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.800
 of the doll I left it open for 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.680
 be able to join it with the arm 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.680
 yellow love of our stuffed animal 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.960
 now we make her shoes a part 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:37.070
 it is straight and the rest is circular 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:40.130
 let's apply silicone each 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.160
 It has two pieces and we are going to fill it 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.770
 with a filling and that is also another 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.240
 piece that will go like that is going to be the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.400
 little leg and that's how they are now in 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.460
 that straight end let's apply 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.910
 silicone to join the shoe with the 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.910
 food 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.630
 and that's how the top part looks 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.160
 it is not sealed, you can see the filling 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.930
 because all that outline I'm going to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.480
 Apply silicone to join it with the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.480
 body and it looks like more stuffed 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.630
 now to form your little eye we need 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.820
 felt white circular small and 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.310
 also one lead a little bit bigger 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.310
 and we join with hot silicone 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.210
 since your eye has to be 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.490
 excel we're going to use a 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.490
 activity of a moderate thickness has 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.730
 to be lead and we're going to sew all the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.090
 circular edge with the entire edge of the 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.090
 scissors 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:41.350
 we sew that edge that opening the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:43.990
 close and then we turn the box you 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.880
 we put stuffing inside the ojito 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.470
 we put aside and now we're going to 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:06:12.720
 use a long black tour 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:06:15.270
 what is going to go in your head now 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.280
 We apply silicon around the edge of the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:23.550
 eye and we paste it in the center after 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.220
 we are going to also strike a circle 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:34.470
 Felt black much smaller than 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:36.570
 it would be like his little legs all 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.760
 I have covered blue so that I go 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.370
 agreement in his clothes and I 've also 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.310
 made your clothes is like the shape of a 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.120
 outfit since the neck part by 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.330
 example has a contoured shape and the 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.800
 part of the little arms is like an ace 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:07:00.590
 no matter what masters so here I already have 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.590
