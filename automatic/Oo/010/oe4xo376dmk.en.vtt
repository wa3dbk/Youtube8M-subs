00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
here but there's not um now these are

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
here but there's not um now these are
pretty<00:00:35.399> much<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.780> start-up

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
