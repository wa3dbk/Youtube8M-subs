00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.809
 good kids Ivan forever and like new 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.209
 video I bring you something very strange inside 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.919
 gta 5 online and well it is a piece 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.539
 of incredible bug with which we are going to 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.910
 have a flying car inside 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.380
 our garage is very rare and very 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 easy to do from here that practically 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.430
 is done just use it is a bug that I do not know 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 why has he put rockstar there will be 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.790
 been unintentionally trying to do some 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 change whatever it is because it has gotten a bug 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.180
 of the host that good then now you will see 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 how is the only thing you have to do is 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.079
 enter your garage and look for a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 car and you have to move it a little bit 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.380
 move the wheels and such and you will see that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.090
 It's like flying, it's worth that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 from your garage there will only be one place 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 have this bus and usually 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.130
 be the one that happens to me is worth but 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.870
 It can also happen to you in any other 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.090
 by the way this trick works both in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 playstation like in xbox then good 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 Well, I 'm trying it first in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 my garage in my garage number eclipse 31 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.210
 like cojones call the garage good 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 number 31 of what is the area of these 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.680
 of the buildings of the apartments more 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.780
 expensive there is but in the building this 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 of always the houses of 400,000 then there 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.200
 I tried it in a garage and it did not come out and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 after you see what I did was change to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 another garage 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 number 3 and in the other garage so with 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 three easily already to the car which 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.220
 was moving already there from the beginning it became 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.690
 crazy and as you can see it is an authentic 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 madness the vehicle does not stop moving 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.290
 float and well then here we can go 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.729
 changing what other vehicles and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 they will continue floating and doing the same 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 effect is worth then we are simply going to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.299
 be moving the analog and such and the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 car since it is of itself because it will start 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.750
 move will return something remove then 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.830
 because it's something very simple, you do not have to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.799
 do no trick or anything like that 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.030
 just go then to make sure I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.350
 I think it will be in any game 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.580
 public or private but good I do it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 in a private 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.479
 you simply enter the garage and that's it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.009
 it's very easy to see it, it's there 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.319
 car floating as you see a little and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.610
 just good because you can take flipas 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.990
 car and put it back and it will continue 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 floating you can change the site 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 car and the car that you put in that place 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
 it will continue to float and good because 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 You can move and drive yourself crazy so 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.200
 nothing kids, it's quite a thing 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 curious just wanted to teach it 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.819
 for you to see it will not last long 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 kind of things because everyone took them 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.390
 fast march plus a car flying 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.160
 in the garage in what balls do not have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.030
 that patch secure so nothing then 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.260
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.010
 they remitted drive 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.010
 And until next time 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.430
 ah 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.430
 ah 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.950
 to
