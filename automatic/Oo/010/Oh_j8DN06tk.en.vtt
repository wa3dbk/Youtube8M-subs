 you're done squid 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 as a confirmation 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.069
 professional uberaba promises 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.110
 the ever-present manifestation 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.220
 in pittsburgh 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.910
 a large door to prevent silver from the house at lunch can also participate 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 anyway the next phase 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.050
 and the reciprocal is true 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.550
 What happened is that by the end of the year 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.920
 he is the one who makes the career annually 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.690
 is the start of the work ours is a very 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.280

 master of the closure of the parker work stations on a beach the holder 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.940
 peiser

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.360
 3 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.090
 that community at the same time that we called networks 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 That's because we play the game. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.790
 by the program exceeded this different value 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.570
 since things were fine a week after the murder the death of Caesar 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.330
 peixoto for the post to defeat no way to say wilson already lost everything promised 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
 kleber will also check it by day 5 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.220
 the black box stayed in the room 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.600
 Nothing arrived until the end of the first group of patrús 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.580
 so it has to be but one thing so said the coolest agent 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.490
 rear that in her wonderful photos 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 there was nothing serious but it's for me 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.600
 but it has a more light 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 Sao Paulo 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.510
 not 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 but what I love the most 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.399
 even without any angle in general 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.949
 to resist the temptation to prove that you will not tolerate 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.999
 corruption but what has been discussed 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.069
 Death actually happened in the past. 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.709
 said it 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.659
 for winter 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.629
 the challenge we face is a classic Nicolas Sarkozy 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.599
 our priority is to double in five years with the hottest demand for high and 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.599
 It gets younger that it worked out fine. 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.710
 let's love 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.209
 there was also a Member 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.099
 It was a wonderful party that blamed those who are going to ask too young 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.009
 We need to accept that they pass through the square. 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.669
 if we want to convert month 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.560
 It's one thing if you do not have to show that everything will ever stand 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:00.789
 also pointed out that the conectur pointed by mpt brasilia closed very much 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.969
 People get easier campinas depending on the situation does not get nice 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.119
 silver 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:09.749
 so people who are on top of it should ask questions of the 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:14.649
 detained but said he preferred to wait for the result to be one hour at 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.649
 film production is expected to arrive this week 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.770
 between those who can lose contracts and the first preview of April 

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:25.769
 would imply the expectation I like 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.509
 the logos were making her mistresses laugh 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.150
 therefore 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.590
 need 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.510
