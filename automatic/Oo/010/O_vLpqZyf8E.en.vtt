00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.440
 so many years after with Dr for his movie the lives of others one 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.010
 Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck had gotten the most part for the first time 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.269
 filmed a big movie in Hollywood 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.170
 and that means 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.089
 the tourist 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.089
 drunk 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 I want to be slim that is totally crazy 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 Unfortunately I might have a different face 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.630
 that will be fine 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.490
 the game was over 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.640
 Scott brought 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 They have 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.760
 Red 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 Abboud 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 because not only RTL 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 Men's 60 farms 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.580
 Further 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.640
 Here two men tried to enter the door 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.570
 that's the problem with the brake 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 Stuttgart 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.460
 Alexander Görzen has saved a gangster a lot of money and how do they think 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.159
 about that 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.159
 the man is a criminal entertainment 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 while 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 that's exactly why he made sure 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550
 by Manfred Haider 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.980
 the area has buried 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.430
 Arnstadt 7 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.530
 yes Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp together in front of the camera 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 the movie pleasure did not exist yet 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.350
 but otherwise the film is very well staffed 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 we have to spur us on Bertolini 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.030
 and Becks 007 votes they wanted 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 that's why years are wondering 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230
 although to complete the now also cards 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.440
 yes, of course, it's great to be together after two such great Hollywood stars 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.020
 to play in a movie 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.100
 which also friends of Donnersmarck also managed by a coup that these 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 brought two big shock together in front of the camera 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.370
 There were many years in advance so it probably lost the role 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 play and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.220
 Instead of Johnny Depp driving Tom Cruise be talking where Ethicon was in 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.370
 conversation 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.480
 because the Thursday of the jumped but probably for the direction 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.189
 make that was in hindsight ago 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.659
 even in Japan they managed to shoot this movie 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.129
 yes the movie is yes percent 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.559
 hitherto panned by the critics 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.959
 So if on YouTube for the criticism of the Frank Rausch look at 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.709
 many critics the front seats movie critics here on youtube on 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.519
 The film is so perverted by Gesa that would be a disaster in each 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.979
 Respects and such 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.199
 I can not understand without the help of the many poems possible 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.059
 which of course APA is right the movie is a bit old-fashioned he made 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:42.589
 is not up to the modern percent with Martin making snow stuck and such is 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.119
 It's an elegant movie and I like it that way because it's on that one 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.070
 overload the Alliance more 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.930
 with the over with quick cut with shaking camera Sun and and blah blah blah 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.470
 Tobias Christ Rolf Hollander zel although he has despite tension and on the horizontal bar 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.960
 Schwimmbeck strike is by law all chase in the eternal 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.330
 with percent of all our senses offered now there is bombarded but by 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.260
 Roofs jumped and so on and so forth 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 So I can I can not understand these for the criticism 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.069
 while relaxed followed by i felt very well alone 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.780
 Instructor also documents about the roofs of Nice or invisible 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.390
 Third »I like it with this movie 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.700
 the serviced options also end up and that was the one spell too 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.310
 Smart about driving in the pit lane though Schmidt made Timo 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.219
 the current one 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.149
 that was just percent secured says he wanted to make my movie really want 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.700
 Glamor again 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.720
 Politis 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.270
 Venice are just very beautiful and very beautiful 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.839
 Filmed scenes is staged around one as well 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.509
 classic percent 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.509
 suffered mysterious Pini story 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.199
 and he did that well, not the original Whistler 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.309
 while French version is indeed Vanishing Point Nice 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:00.869
 when it finally got done yes and there what then Sophie Marceau Julie Delpy the 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.069
 This ladies plays has that gesture the movie has been a one percent 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.919
 remake 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.699
 although process is not a 1 1 there are already differences but Klose like that 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.579
 start much of the 7 soon 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.239
 but still both films are very exciting I have to theirs too 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.239
 Bertelsmann was as happy as the tourist 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.669
 As I said, this bad review for Soto can not understand it 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.689
 I think it's all around, no worries a little bit 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.580
 also at the rear sat some nice things in such a big making-of 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.860
 and Dr over the scene as in Venice gets bigger also percent 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.340
 Picture is described as it all so Rapid our son is a few 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.349
 Outfits in the Valais are funny 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.539
 Interviews are there and so 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.450
 and you also have percent 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.820
 I am rarely German DVD also give Germany some for the interview 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.169
 is also clear and take away 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.360
 and the audio commentary from Nîmes also on much more to the film that them 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.319
 also personally attacked for 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.240
 this is not just a purely to 1 take over Dr USt 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.580
 the made but we have the kids so I find the movie 8 points 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.339
 like so often I just can not fault it 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.439
 and the Access the King from him 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.439
 with felling and extras 8 points each 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.999
 so they let themselves be irritated by bad credit and also 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.919
 the movie is great 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.270
 make your own picture 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.210
 Photo the OK 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.720
 a lot of ridicule
