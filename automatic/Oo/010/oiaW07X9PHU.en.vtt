the device I just reviewed the jawbone
you<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:12.990> can't<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you really can't see a really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.090 
you really can't see a really
significant<00:01:14.880> size<00:01:15.240> difference<00:01:15.920> put<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.009> up

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
significant size difference put them up

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
significant size difference put them up
next<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> each<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.180> contour<00:01:18.659> metal<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
next to each other the contour metal is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
next to each other the contour metal is
probably<00:01:19.500> half<00:01:19.799> maybe<00:01:20.520> even<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> quarter<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
probably half maybe even a quarter the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
probably half maybe even a quarter the
thickness<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> jawbone<00:01:23.250> certainly<00:01:23.700> half

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
thickness of the jawbone certainly half

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.260 
thickness of the jawbone certainly half
the<00:01:24.270> weight<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.890> ahead<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> zoom<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:27.030> out

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the weight so go ahead and zoom back out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
the weight so go ahead and zoom back out
as<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.259> talking<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.299> since<00:01:30.299> this
