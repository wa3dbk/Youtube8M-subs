hydrocarbon chains that we want to break

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
hydrocarbon chains that we want to break
here<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> reactor<00:01:39.509> where<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> process

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
here is a reactor where the process

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
here is a reactor where the process
takes<00:01:41.490> place<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.000> takes<00:01:42.030> only<00:01:42.600> fractions<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
takes place it takes only fractions of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
takes place it takes only fractions of
seconds<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.509> cracking<00:01:46.110> over

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
seconds to start the cracking over

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
seconds to start the cracking over
carbon-carbon<00:01:47.310> bonds<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> oil

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
carbon-carbon bonds so we get the oil

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.210 
carbon-carbon bonds so we get the oil
back<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.130> oil<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.270> vaporized<00:01:52.200> due<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> the

back and the oil is vaporized due to the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
back and the oil is vaporized due to the
high<00:01:53.729> temperature<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.720> goes<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.320> through

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
high temperature and goes out through

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
made from to start with okay and here we

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789 
made from to start with okay and here we
go<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.729> conversating<00:02:06.420> unit<00:02:06.930> where<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> oil

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
go to a conversating unit where the oil

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.930 
go to a conversating unit where the oil
simply<00:02:08.069> comes<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.670> here

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
simply comes out here

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.630 
simply comes out here
to<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.479> tank<00:02:10.720> form<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:12.430> how<00:02:12.580> we

to the tank form and that's how we

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.950 
to the tank form and that's how we
convert<00:02:13.320> waste<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:15.040> goes<00:02:15.430> into<00:02:15.700> landfill<00:02:16.210> to

it's a very economically viable we are

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.440 
it's a very economically viable we are
producing<00:03:14.020> oil<00:03:14.350> at<00:03:14.800> price<00:03:15.670> depending<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.270> all

it's also a light or a little bit

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.300 
it's also a light or a little bit
heavier<00:03:55.390> instead<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.500> wasting<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:57.130> in

we<00:05:06.160> do<00:05:06.310> build<00:05:06.580> refineries<00:05:07.150> for<00:05:07.330> crackers<00:05:07.570> in

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
we do build refineries for crackers in

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.050 
we do build refineries for crackers in
it<00:05:08.020> what<00:05:08.380> we<00:05:08.500> got<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:09.010> casandra's<00:05:09.490> technology

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
it what we got in casandra's technology

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.510 
it what we got in casandra's technology
is<00:05:10.150> really<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.570> mini<00:05:10.780> cracker<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.980> we'll<00:05:12.370> be

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
is really a mini cracker that we'll be

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.270 
is really a mini cracker that we'll be
able<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.940> clean<00:05:13.660> up<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.680> environment<00:05:14.800> the

able to clean up the environment the
dumps<00:05:15.640> know<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.600> huge<00:05:17.140> problem<00:05:17.650> for<00:05:18.040> those

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
dumps know a huge problem for those

dumps know a huge problem for those
countries<00:05:19.090> where<00:05:19.480> we<00:05:19.630> have<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.380> waste<00:05:20.650> for

countries where we have this waste for

countries where we have this waste for
us<00:05:21.550> it's<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:22.060> huge<00:05:22.230> opportunity<00:05:23.230> because<00:05:24.190> we

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
us it's a huge opportunity because we

us it's a huge opportunity because we
will<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.670> making<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:25.150> product<00:05:25.840> out<00:05:25.960> of<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.230> waste
