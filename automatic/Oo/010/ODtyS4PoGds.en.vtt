00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.539 

I<00:03:22.469> really<00:03:23.469> like<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.920> feel<00:03:24.189> of<00:03:24.219> this

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.910 
foundation it is so easy to blend really
liked<00:03:35.469> it<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.540> quite<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.379> finish<00:03:38.739> of

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
liked it so I quite like the finish of

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.640 
liked it so I quite like the finish of
the<00:03:39.250> foundation<00:03:39.969> will<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.420> go<00:03:40.569> closer<00:03:40.989> it's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the foundation will just go closer it's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.789 
the foundation will just go closer it's
a<00:03:42.189> probability<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.239> medium<00:03:43.689> one<00:03:44.170> I<00:03:44.439> haven't

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
a probability of medium one I haven't

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.709 
a probability of medium one I haven't
put<00:03:45.010> too<00:03:45.189> much<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.700> did<00:03:46.000> was<00:03:46.180> use<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:46.719 
put too much all I did was use that

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.280 
put too much all I did was use that
little<00:03:46.900> bit<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:47.260> was<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> cap<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:49.569> CC

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
little bit that was on a cap and the CC

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.369 
little bit that was on a cap and the CC
primer<00:03:50.590> itself<00:03:51.250> does<00:03:52.209> offer<00:03:52.510> some<00:03:52.959> cup

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
primer itself does offer some cup

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.780 
primer itself does offer some cup
coverage<00:03:54.189> as<00:03:54.370> well

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
coverage as well

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.080 
coverage as well
so<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.689> that<00:03:55.840> was<00:03:55.959> quite<00:03:56.109> good<00:03:56.169> just<00:03:57.090> letting

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
so it that was quite good just letting

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.750 
so it that was quite good just letting
it<00:03:58.180> set<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> bit<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.349> think<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.709> will<00:03:59.919> use<00:03:59.950> my

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
it set a bit and I think I will use my

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.780 
it set a bit and I think I will use my
top<00:04:01.209> some<00:04:02.139> operator<00:04:02.919> powder<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.609> to<00:04:03.730> set

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
top some operator powder just to set

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.339 
top some operator powder just to set
everything<00:04:05.159> hmm<00:04:06.159> I<00:04:06.340> really<00:04:06.700> do<00:04:07.299> think<00:04:07.629> that

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
everything hmm I really do think that

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.690 
everything hmm I really do think that
this<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.919> nation<00:04:09.400> gives<00:04:09.669> you<00:04:09.819> quite<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.209> good

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
this one nation gives you quite a good

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.089 
this one nation gives you quite a good
finish<00:04:12.700> really<00:04:13.599> pretty<00:04:13.959> finish<00:04:14.409> we'll<00:04:15.400> use

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
finish really pretty finish we'll use

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.439 
finish really pretty finish we'll use
the<00:04:18.570> pink<00:04:19.570> bronze<00:04:20.109> brush<00:04:21.120> come<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.300> this

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
the pink bronze brush come to this

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.760 
the pink bronze brush come to this
beautiful<00:04:23.259> container<00:04:23.889> like<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:25.470> open<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.620> up

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
beautiful container like that open it up

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.379 
beautiful container like that open it up
and<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.330> circle<00:04:28.599> just<00:04:29.169> look<00:04:29.349> at<00:04:29.500> that

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
and it's a circle just look at that

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.930 
and it's a circle just look at that
isn't<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.659> pretty<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.500> think<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:33.699> so

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
isn't that pretty I think that's so

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.890 
isn't that pretty I think that's so
pretty<00:04:35.430> then<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.550> use<00:04:36.729> a<00:04:36.760> fan<00:04:37.150> brush<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.750> this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
pretty then you use a fan brush of this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.909 
pretty then you use a fan brush of this

one this one's by Ecotools lies a little

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.589 
one this one's by Ecotools lies a little
bit<00:04:45.099> more<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.970> sort<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.409> chiseled<00:04:47.409> look

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599

not going to today because I want to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.210 
not going to today because I want to
really<00:05:11.990> test<00:05:12.380> out<00:05:13.210> what<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.360> looks<00:05:14.600> like

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
really test out what it looks like

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.510 
really test out what it looks like
without<00:05:16.220> that<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:18.020> I'm<00:05:18.860> just<00:05:19.280> going<00:05:19.460> to

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
without that so I'm just going to

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.350 
without that so I'm just going to
continue<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.540> apply<00:05:21.730> like<00:05:22.730> drawing<00:05:23.180> my

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
continue and apply like drawing my

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.430 
continue and apply like drawing my
eyebrows<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.620> I'll<00:05:25.250> get<00:05:25.550> back<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.700> you

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
eyebrows and I'll get back to you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.130 
eyebrows and I'll get back to you
throughout<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.710> day<00:05:27.740> so<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:29.180> think<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.960> last

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
throughout the day so I think the last

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.130 
throughout the day so I think the last
time<00:05:30.320> we<00:05:30.500> checked<00:05:30.740> time<00:05:31.100> was<00:05:31.370> 12:58<00:05:32.150> p.m.<00:05:32.180> in

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
time we checked time was 12:58 p.m. in

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.650 
time we checked time was 12:58 p.m. in
the<00:05:33.320> afternoon<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:34.280> Sydney<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.030> then<00:05:35.270> I'll

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
the afternoon and Sydney and then I'll

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.440 
the afternoon and Sydney and then I'll
check<00:05:36.020> in<00:05:36.230> periodically<00:05:36.910> see<00:05:37.910> ya<00:05:38.090> hi<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.740> the

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
check in periodically see ya hi so the

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.090 
check in periodically see ya hi so the
foundation<00:05:41.450> seems<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.990> be<00:05:42.170> holding<00:05:42.650> up<00:05:42.950> really

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
foundation seems to be holding up really

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.590

eight hours you definitely see there's
some<00:06:24.270> shiny<00:06:24.600> spots<00:06:25.020> here<00:06:25.320> I<00:06:25.560> haven't<00:06:26.520> powdered

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
some shiny spots here I haven't powdered
