 in the first half of the thirties one 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:04.960
 of the best in the world 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.610
 he was considered soviet heavy 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.739
 bomber 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.079
 flight combat characteristics of this 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.649
 were at the level of the best samples 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.649
 the plane was considered reliable and simple 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.070
 faster or higher 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.999
 remembers such 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.380
 weight 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.429
 it was released in quantities not 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.730
 seen and unheard of in order 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.640
 of time 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 he was proud of the military 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.770
 country leaders of the Soviets 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.300
 and correspondingly

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.420
 according to the test results it becomes 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.580
 it is clear that nb 1 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 vastly superior currency 1 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840
 now the Soviet side does not see 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 no point in giving yourself a concession 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.810

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.490
 it would be unfair to attribute 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.580
 sleight of hand cinema 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.910

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.820
 and in the end 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 the winners are not judged 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.910
 one of the guns the first copy of the aircraft 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.230
 for a long time was in proud 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.330

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.920
 on approval of the type of weapons brand

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.740
 mass production 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740

 in 1929 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.210
 on the plane amounted to 2 9 or m17 Soviet

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.459
 his equal 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.319
 all other countries have not built cars yet 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.180
 of this class all the more 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.149
 in bulk quantities 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.319

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.010
 Soviet industry 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.569
 released 216 cars 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.079
 they were in service until 1936 by

 in sk when changing airplanes gb 1 tb 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.859
 started a heavy brigade

 bomber aviation 50 cars each 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.979
 so in the Soviet Union began to incarnate 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.999
 in the life of the general doctrine blowing 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.149

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.370
 fighting during a conflict 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.999

 the chef is 7529 years old 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.689
 not stood idle and 216 peter first 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.939
 they are of course somewhat outdated as combat 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:30.909
 units 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.579
 and military forces and little by little 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.550
 parted 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.560
 but aeroflot decommissioned combat 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.539
 I took the technique with pleasure 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.199
 specially converted 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.139
 curves first played a big role in 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.739
 Arctic exploration 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.059
 in the harsh conditions of the Arctic no 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.529
 unpretentious cars showed themselves perfectly 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.419
 demanded the first to glorify himself in 1930 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.069

 crew and passengers left sinking 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.739
 ship and landed on the ice 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.669
 cut off from the mainland they are 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.159
 expected help 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.549
 the whole country has caused a new watched 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.409
 the fate of people in trouble 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.459
 means lyapidevsky on the plane add and 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.749
 did not make a workshop landing on 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.749
 drifting ice and delivered 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.219
 as a result of the plane
