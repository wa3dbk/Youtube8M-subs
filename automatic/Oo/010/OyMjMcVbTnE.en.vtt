damage to those Fester's there but

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.479 
damage to those Fester's there but
apparently<00:02:56.590> they've<00:02:57.010> done<00:02:57.310> their<00:02:57.459> research

there we are here we go here is our full
hive<00:04:16.900> mining<00:04:17.380> ship<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.090> not<00:04:19.299> crazy<00:04:19.959> nice

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
hive mining ship is that not crazy nice

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.909 
hive mining ship is that not crazy nice
it<00:04:22.930> looks<00:04:23.199> like<00:04:23.470> oh<00:04:25.530> yeah<00:04:26.530> there's<00:04:26.770> the

it looks like oh yeah there's the

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.589 
it looks like oh yeah there's the
refiners<00:04:27.490> or<00:04:27.729> finders<00:04:28.030> around<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.389> side

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
refiners or finders around the side

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:34.040 
refiners or finders around the side
there<00:04:30.360> probably<00:04:31.360> got<00:04:31.539> some<00:04:31.750> assemblers

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
there probably got some assemblers

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.180 
there probably got some assemblers
should<00:04:35.050> we<00:04:35.139> try<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.409> should<00:04:35.650> we<00:04:35.710> try<00:04:35.860> giving<00:04:36.039> it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
should we try it should we try giving it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.940 
should we try it should we try giving it
a<00:04:36.220> little<00:04:36.639> bit<00:04:36.849> of<00:04:36.940> thrust<00:04:40.680> yeah<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.770> doesn't

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.970 
a little bit of thrust yeah it doesn't
move<00:04:42.099> very<00:04:42.159> fast<00:04:42.460> does<00:04:42.729> it

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.350 
it's coming from it sounds likely damage
to<00:05:29.640> ship<00:05:29.910> but<00:05:30.300> i<00:05:31.520> can't<00:05:32.520> imagine<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:33.120> have

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
to ship but i can't imagine that we have

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240 
to ship but i can't imagine that we have
it<00:05:34.320> looks<00:05:34.500> like<00:05:34.650> it's<00:05:34.800> pretty<00:05:34.860> well

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
it looks like it's pretty well

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.470 
it looks like it's pretty well
engineered<00:05:35.820> now<00:05:37.430> do<00:05:38.430> we<00:05:38.640> have<00:05:38.670> a<00:05:38.910> list<00:05:39.300> a

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
engineered now do we have a list a

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.170 
engineered now do we have a list a
conveyor<00:05:39.840> system<00:05:40.410> all<00:05:40.620> right<00:05:41.780> do<00:05:42.780> we<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:42.960> a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
conveyor system all right do we have a

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.880 
conveyor system all right do we have a
way<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.240> access<00:05:45.480> everything<00:05:46.020> on<00:05:46.320> board<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.740> see
