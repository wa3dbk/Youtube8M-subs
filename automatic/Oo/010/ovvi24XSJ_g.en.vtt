overnight is recommended you can see the
dough<00:00:32.250> becoming<00:00:32.669> thick<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.630> will<00:00:33.870> take<00:00:34.110> less

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
dough becoming thick this will take less

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.850 
dough becoming thick this will take less
than<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.890> minute<00:00:35.510> now<00:00:36.510> immediately<00:00:37.079> add<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
than one minute now immediately add the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
than one minute now immediately add the
remaining<00:00:38.190> milk<00:00:38.489> aiming<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> center<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
remaining milk aiming for the center of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
remaining milk aiming for the center of
the<00:00:40.170> bowl<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:41.520> add<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> remaining

the bowl and then add the remaining
butter<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> batter<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.070> quickly<00:00:44.370> thicken

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
butter the batter will quickly thicken

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
butter the batter will quickly thicken
so<00:00:45.270> you'll<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> increase<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.500> mixing

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so you'll need to increase the mixing

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
so you'll need to increase the mixing
speed<00:00:47.329> now<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.870> strengthen<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.440> structure

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
speed now be to strengthen the structure

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.000 
speed now be to strengthen the structure
about<00:00:50.219> 30<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> 60<00:00:50.730> seconds<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
about 30 to 60 seconds you will see the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
about 30 to 60 seconds you will see the
batter<00:00:53.219> forming<00:00:53.699> webs<00:00:53.969> from<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> the
