00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.640
 plus 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.299
 hello friends I'm going to show you a trap 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.640
 that occurs in the Sicilian defense 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.119
 exactly in the specific variant or 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.119
 movie 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.410
 the opening begins with 4 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 65 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.839
 f3 horse 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.839
 horse 6 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.910
 of 4 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 be by 4 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.960
 horse of 4 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 horse 16 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 attacking the pawn of 4 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.839
 horses of three I understand 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.190
 is 5 attacking the 4 horse 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.649
 basic horse this is typical in this 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.649
 opening 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.250
 Of 6 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.290
 and now the white begins the trap 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 horse 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.869
 if at this moment what are 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.210
 threatening White in case the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.180
 black catch at the worst is word 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.050
 horse 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.970
 feel and win a tower therefore 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.970
 Blacks take the horse 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 horse in size 5 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 but by 5 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 and also being the hair 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.420
 the horse has two options or it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.159
 retires backwards and wastes a time or 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.920
 there are seven because if you come 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.020
 until here it would be attacked again 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.399
 some others worse and I would have to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.780
 retire to a pretty box 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.250
 therefore uncomfortable 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 the case the horse is removed 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.020
 until the box is always 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.900
 at this time 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.550
 the white take care 4 supporting what 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 we have entered is attacked by the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.110
 horse 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.750
 blacks turn off to throw the horse 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.070
 uncomfortable and specific 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 and white places his lady attacking 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.980
 by x- rays to the king who is in 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.780
 the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.480
 as we can see we are dominating a 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.940
 gene that has discovered an attack was 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.550
 discovered therefore the situation of 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.020
 of the king of blacks is a delicate 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 attack to the discovered and we would win 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.640
 therefore at this moment the black 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.640
 they fall into the trap and 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:10.760
 of cover a bishop 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:15.280
 of 7 and get checkmate a horse 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.950
 that's why you can see checkmate 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.840
 and the game is won for the brands 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 however in case of now played 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.720
 at the end of seven that is a play 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.849
 very bad in case of having touched counted 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.510
 also the plate has no mate 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.989
 but a horse has the advantage 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.989
 and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.500
 cavallo by 6 to that would have to move 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.640
 the bathroom can capture again 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.430
 in that 7 with check and later 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.650
 capture the tower and in the king's case 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 move back to this box could 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.170
 give another to win over others in 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.390
 case you do not want testers 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.360
 Well I hope you liked these 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.599
 frosts and that we bathe in a next 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.599
 video
