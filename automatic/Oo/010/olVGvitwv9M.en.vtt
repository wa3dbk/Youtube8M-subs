00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
loaf but before we get to that let's ask

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.510 
loaf but before we get to that let's ask
why<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.230> crust<00:00:36.560> gets<00:00:36.770> hard<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.310> first

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
why the crust gets hard in the first

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.639 
why the crust gets hard in the first
place<00:00:37.760> well<00:00:38.149> lots<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.810> lokes<00:00:39.050> moisture

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
place well lots of the lokes moisture

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.370 
place well lots of the lokes moisture
escapes<00:00:40.100> as<00:00:40.460> steam<00:00:41.090> welds<00:00:41.450> coolant<00:00:41.840> now<00:00:42.320> you

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
escapes as steam welds coolant now you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.349 
escapes as steam welds coolant now you
may<00:00:42.590> be<00:00:42.620> thinking<00:00:42.739> if<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.579> can<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:43.910> prevent

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
may be thinking if you can just prevent

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.849 
may be thinking if you can just prevent
all<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.780> steam<00:00:45.019> from<00:00:45.170> escaping

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
all that steam from escaping

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.650 
all that steam from escaping
then<00:00:46.190> maybe<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.550> crust<00:00:46.760> won't<00:00:47.000> dry<00:00:47.180> out<00:00:47.210> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
then maybe the crust won't dry out and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.830 
then maybe the crust won't dry out and
you'd<00:00:47.870> be<00:00:47.960> right<00:00:48.140> now<00:00:49.059> there's<00:00:50.059> right<00:00:50.390> way<00:00:50.600> and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
you'd be right now there's right way and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.599 
you'd be right now there's right way and
there's<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.140> wrong<00:00:51.320> way<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.590> do<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.920> some<00:00:52.370> wrong

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
there's a wrong way to do it some wrong

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.720 
there's a wrong way to do it some wrong
ways<00:00:52.910> would<00:00:53.120> be<00:00:53.179> to<00:00:53.390> put<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.870> box<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:55.070> some

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
ways would be to put it in a box or some

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.180 
ways would be to put it in a box or some
sort<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.030> bag<00:00:56.300> for<00:00:57.170> boxes<00:00:57.649> because<00:00:57.980> there's

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
sort of bag for boxes because there's

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.680 
sort of bag for boxes because there's
still<00:00:58.370> gonna<00:00:58.519> be<00:00:58.609> some<00:00:58.760> airspace<00:00:59.420> around

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
still gonna be some airspace around

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.049 
still gonna be some airspace around
where<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.559> steam<00:01:00.800> is<00:01:00.829> gonna<00:01:01.129> go<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.579> you

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
where the steam is gonna go and you

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.450 
where the steam is gonna go and you
still<00:01:02.329> loose<00:01:02.539> moisture<00:01:03.320> bag<00:01:03.769> it's<00:01:04.129> because

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
still loose moisture bag it's because

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.490 
still loose moisture bag it's because
bags<00:01:04.730> tend<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.330> expand<00:01:05.930> when<00:01:06.230> you've<00:01:06.380> got

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
bags tend to expand when you've got

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.440 
bags tend to expand when you've got
steam<00:01:06.800> inside<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.310> them<00:01:07.460> causing<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.270> same

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
steam inside of them causing the same

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.270 
steam inside of them causing the same
problem<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.320> need<00:01:09.500> something<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.920> wraps

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
problem you need something that wraps

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.550 
problem you need something that wraps
the<00:01:10.490> loaf<00:01:10.700> up<00:01:11.000> tightly<00:01:11.480> now<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.380> may<00:01:12.530> be

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the loaf up tightly now you may be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.890 
the loaf up tightly now you may be
thinking<00:01:12.800> what<00:01:13.190> about<00:01:13.250> aluminum<00:01:13.970> foil<00:01:14.270> you'd

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
thinking what about aluminum foil you'd

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.700 
thinking what about aluminum foil you'd
be<00:01:15.050> on<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.200> right<00:01:15.440> track

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
be on the right track

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.670 
be on the right track
except<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.850> steam<00:01:17.510> can<00:01:17.750> corrode<00:01:18.080> aluminum

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
except that steam can corrode aluminum

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160 
except that steam can corrode aluminum
which<00:01:19.190> would<00:01:19.460> cause<00:01:19.760> holes<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.360> form<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.960> you

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
which would cause holes to form and you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.690 
which would cause holes to form and you
might<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:21.560> some<00:01:21.770> metal<00:01:22.040> residue<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.640> your

might have some metal residue on your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.180 
might have some metal residue on your
loaf<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.660> yes<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.440> am<00:01:24.620> speaking<00:01:24.980> from

loaf and yes I am speaking from

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.060 
loaf and yes I am speaking from

now maybe you're savvy and maybe you've
heard<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.310> if<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.640> exposed<00:01:32.570> plastic<00:01:33.290> wrap

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
heard that if you exposed plastic wrap

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.200 
heard that if you exposed plastic wrap
to<00:01:33.650> high<00:01:33.800> temperatures<00:01:34.400> such<00:01:34.730> as<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.090> would

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
to high temperatures such as you would

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.300 
to high temperatures such as you would

have with steam toxic chemicals can be
leached<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.210> plastic<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.140> contaminate

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
leached out of plastic and contaminate

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.430 
leached out of plastic and contaminate
your<00:01:40.190> food<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.880> used<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.300> be<00:01:41.420> true<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:41.690> not

your food that used to be true but not
so<00:01:42.650> much<00:01:42.800> anymore<00:01:43.070> most<00:01:43.460> plastic<00:01:43.970> wraps<00:01:44.180> these

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
so much anymore most plastic wraps these

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.190 
so much anymore most plastic wraps these
days<00:01:44.600> are<00:01:44.750> safe

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
days are safe

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.930 
days are safe
and<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.710> want<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> be<00:01:46.040> sure<00:01:46.280> all<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.850> have

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and if you want to be sure all you have

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.240 
and if you want to be sure all you have
to<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.330> check<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.630> box<00:01:47.750> if<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.710> says<00:01:48.950> it's
