00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.140
 Go back, 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.000
 only for this one night. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.460
 Come as you Are, 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.540
 but I'm doing as well as I can. 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.840
 It's called "Be yourself," 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.260
 But what does that mean? 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.220
 The rain on the street washes my life away. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.340
 Use the night, 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 This time, they let you in. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.340
 Count again, 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 The last shirt has no pockets. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160
 But one of the notes, 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 you will need tomorrow. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.560
 I can also walk home, 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.300
 what I want now is that. 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.402
 You and me, we feel the same. 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.340
 That's exactly what I mean, you know? 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.640
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.460
 And that they keep their shit, 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.160
 "Bass" 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.720
 can keep their shit, 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.120
 will I show them to those? 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.660
 Honestly, someday. 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.440
 "Rave" 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 Do that in your glass, 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 then you do not sleep today. 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.820
 Somebody said something 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.756
 I hear "No idea" scream. 

00:01:13.756 --> 00:01:15.216
 The girl is cute, 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.580
 I say, "I do not really dance because, 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 if you fly, you can not use your feet. " 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.400
 And something about it 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.380
 is damn beautiful as it is. 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.420
 In all the fog stays for hours 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.400
 everything stops when she kisses me. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.140
 And the guy that nobody knows, 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 give us all a round. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520
 What was that stuff, man? 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.116
 That bangs quite nice. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.060
 You and me, we feel the same. 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.420
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.860
 That's exactly what I mean, you know? 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.060
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 And that they keep their shit, 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.580
 "Bass" 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.160
 can keep their shit, 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.540
 will I show them to those? 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.980
 Honestly, someday. 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.980
 "Rave" 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840
 Silence after the rejoicing, 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 I'm in a trance. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.934
 And that was it, 

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.114
 the smell of freedom on the street. 

00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:02.034
 The glow of light through broken glass, 

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:03.754
 rewind, 

00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:05.434
 only for this one night. 

00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:07.714
 Play the song again, 

00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:09.294
 just as a reminder. 

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:11.114
 Say goodbye, 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.520
 to what never comes again. 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.800
 Many hearts, 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 The very quiet beat. 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 I go home and do not remember who I was. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 You and me, we feel the same. 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.480
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.060
 That's exactly what I mean, you know? 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.240
 "Rave, Rave" 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.920
 And those who keep their shit, 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.780
 "Bass" 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.500
 can keep their shit, 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.980
 will I show them to those? 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.179
 Honestly, someday. 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.317
 "Rave"
