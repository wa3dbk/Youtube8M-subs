it as you as you know there there are
lots<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.179> applications<00:00:15.179> or<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.570> key

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
lots of applications or some key

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.740 
lots of applications or some key
applications<00:00:16.470> they<00:00:16.890> give<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> full

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
applications they give you the full

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.870 
applications they give you the full
instrument<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.070> procedure<00:00:20.070> plates<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
instrument of procedure plates and so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.390 
instrument of procedure plates and so
forth<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.960> well<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.609> visual<00:00:24.980> maps<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
forth as well as is the visual maps and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000 
forth as well as is the visual maps and
the<00:00:26.970> instrument<00:00:27.720> low<00:00:28.140> altitude<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.680> high

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the instrument low altitude and high

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
the instrument low altitude and high
altitude<00:00:29.220> charts<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.480> stuff<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.289> that's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
altitude charts all that stuff so that's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
altitude charts all that stuff so that's
good<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.219> what's<00:00:32.430> interesting<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
