00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.610
 in the ninth ready-mix concrete to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 the one that supplied by a provider 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 which is different from the company and obstructs 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 which is mainly dedicated to this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.779
 activity the companies have both the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 necessary technical and human resources 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 to dose prepare and transport the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.150
 concrete to the place where it is achieved 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.150
 definitely 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.670
 The main advantage is that the principal 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 the manufacturing of the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 concrete can dedicate this time to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
 other tasks streamlining the tasks of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 construction and guaranteeing quality and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.550
 cleaning at the time another advantage is the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 Most physical space saving 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 of the cases does not meet with the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 enough space to store 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.130
 materials and elements required for 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 processing of concrete control 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.970
 about the materials and the process of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 mixed that is carried in the plant is 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.350
 the highest possible quality since this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.479
 load of experts who have enough 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.009
 experience in the subject achieving if 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.410
 meet your requirements of 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.700
 buyer and it is normal there is the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.740
 possibility of receiving large 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 Million amounts continuously 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 for long periods without wasting 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.550
 the time it would take to make the mixtures 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 boxes are complete where the settlers 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.380
 they required that they can become 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.600
 many cubic meters a day there is a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
 greater minds in the work avoiding fines 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
 because there is not often the way 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 public or the materials the fact of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.700
 buy a volume of mixed concrete 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.450
 we avoid the complications of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.800
 Acquire materials preserve 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.280
 all this translates into a mere control 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.280
 of stress 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.680
 In general there are two types of 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.090
 central concrete mixer the central 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.090
 dosing machine and the mixing station 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.280
 concrete the dosing station is a 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.040
 plant in which weights are also weighed 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 components the concrete and then once 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.740
 is the dosage are entered at 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.170
 truck where the kneading is done 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.160
 corresponding the plant to more works in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 change weighs me down and kneades the components 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.420
 in them 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.819
 mixed jonas enter the truck 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 commonly the premixed concrete is 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.260
 moves from the plant to the work in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.060
 three types transport is the truck 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.690
 mixer of which a mixer truck 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.280
 that comes from a shincal dosing 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 mixed during 10 with speed of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.600
 between 70 and 100 rpm to maintain 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.600
 the homogenous mixture or there is also the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.930
 hectic carmen if a central comes 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.269
 to more flavors 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.420
 it is used but not very normally 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.209
 also hopper trucks that fly in 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.989
 that 1934 h should go completely 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.939
 covered with full moon thinks having 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.829
 the precaution that during the trip does not 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.239
 exceed speeds greater than 20 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.420
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.560
 removing starts is nothing sharp 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.560
 for mining operations that usual and use 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 railway 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.190
 according to the norm in that 1934 art the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.140
 Transfer times should not exceed 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.510
 two hours unless there is a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.040
 agreement between the parties in which case 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.720
 will take the technical measures to 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.180
 secure the properties of the concrete 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.310
 once the concrete arrives the place 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.590
 of delivery since the mixture leaves the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.660
 truck until it is placed in its 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.480
 time definite place can not 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.650
 exceed 30 minutes this last according to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.650
 the existing standard 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 everything between concrete that when registering 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.519
 the document is called a space guide 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.470
 because once you reach your destination 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.640
 of your revised to verify if it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.549
 meets all specifications 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.049
 techniques required by the command once 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.450
 Indeed this is necessary to complete the 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.250
 document and receive the concrete when 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.870
 of knowing the option to concrete in now 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.909
 this one can be transported is 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.590
 final location using varied 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.739
 means such as the wheelbarrow is 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.879
 Pacho pumps stationary telescopic a 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.879
 emptying directly in hour 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.349
 repressions carrying him
