I'm<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.120> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.300> ink<00:01:50.480> up<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.630> front<00:01:53.470> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
I'm just going to ink up the front and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.840 
I'm just going to ink up the front and
as<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:54.740> doing<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.100> just<00:01:55.160> going<00:01:55.430> right<00:01:55.640> along

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
as I'm doing is just going right along

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:17.560 
as I'm doing is just going right along
the<00:01:56.030> edges<00:01:56.180> just<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.460> ok<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.450> I'm<00:02:17.450> going

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
the edges just like that ok so I'm going

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.120 
the edges just like that ok so I'm going
to<00:02:17.630> start<00:02:17.720> by<00:02:17.990> layering<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.530> bird<00:02:18.740> together

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
to start by layering my bird together

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.040 
to start by layering my bird together
and<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.090> use<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.270> liquid<00:02:20.690> adhesive

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
and I'm going to use a liquid adhesive

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.160 
and I'm going to use a liquid adhesive
for<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:21.920> um<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:23.390> need<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> little<00:02:23.990> bit

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
for this because um I need a little bit

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.700 
for this because um I need a little bit
of<00:02:24.230> time<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:25.600> get<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:26.810> lined<00:02:27.020> up<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.410> stuff

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
of time to get it all lined up and stuff

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.770 
of time to get it all lined up and stuff
so<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> know<00:02:28.580> liquid<00:02:29.060> adhesive<00:02:29.150> will<00:02:29.660> work

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
so I know liquid adhesive will work

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
so I know liquid adhesive will work
better<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.220> start<00:02:31.520> with<00:02:31.640> my

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
better so I'm going to start with my

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.510 
better so I'm going to start with my
bottom<00:02:32.090> layer<00:02:32.209> which<00:02:32.450> would<00:02:32.600> be<00:02:32.780> my<00:02:33.650> piece<00:02:34.280> cut

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
bottom layer which would be my piece cut

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.690 
bottom layer which would be my piece cut
out<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> Kraft<00:02:35.030> cardstock<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:39.700> that's

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
out in the Kraft cardstock and that's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:56.500 
out in the Kraft cardstock and that's
going<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.910> get<00:02:41.030> layered<00:02:42.370> right<00:02:43.370> onto<00:02:43.850> here

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.589 

just<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.970> then<00:02:58.970> I'm<00:02:59.120> going<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.330> do

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
just like that and then I'm going to do

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.699 
just like that and then I'm going to do
my<00:03:00.489> little<00:03:01.489> brown<00:03:01.760> piece<00:03:02.060> here<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.620> my

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
my little brown piece here and for my

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.720 
my little brown piece here and for my
brown<00:03:03.890> piece<00:03:04.099> i<00:03:04.250> used<00:03:04.599> some<00:03:05.650> act<00:03:06.650> echo<00:03:07.340> part<00:03:07.579> no

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
brown piece i used some act echo part no

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.309 
brown piece i used some act echo part no
this<00:03:07.909> isn't<00:03:08.180> Echo<00:03:08.269> Park<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.900> think

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
this isn't Echo Park you know I think

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.960 
this isn't Echo Park you know I think
it's<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:09.650> mind's<00:03:09.860> eye<00:03:10.099> it's<00:03:10.459> from<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.760> little

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
it's my mind's eye it's from a little

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.199 
it's my mind's eye it's from a little
collection<00:03:11.239> pack<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.870> got<00:03:12.879> so<00:03:13.879> again<00:03:14.120> I'm

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
collection pack that I got so again I'm

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.580 
collection pack that I got so again I'm
just<00:03:14.329> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.540> use<00:03:14.690> my<00:03:14.720> liquid<00:03:15.079> adhesive<00:03:15.200> on

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
just going to use my liquid adhesive on

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.350 
just going to use my liquid adhesive on
this<00:03:15.739> as<00:03:15.890> well<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.909> gives<00:03:17.030> me<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.269> little

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
this as well and this gives me a little

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.470 
this as well and this gives me a little
bit<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.659> time<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.790> kind<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.060> wiggle<00:03:20.299> things

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
bit of time to kind of wiggle things

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:32.140 
bit of time to kind of wiggle things
around<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.870> line<00:03:21.049> them<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:29.530> ok<00:03:30.909> so<00:03:31.909> that<00:03:32.120> is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
around and line them up ok so that is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.580 
around and line them up ok so that is
that<00:03:33.340> let<00:03:34.340> me<00:03:34.459> put<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.730> lid<00:03:34.909> on<00:03:35.120> my<00:03:35.590> adhesive

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
that let me put the lid on my adhesive

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.979 
that let me put the lid on my adhesive
here<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:38.230> then<00:03:39.230> I'm<00:03:39.349> going<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.560> use<00:03:39.739> some

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
here and then I'm going to use some

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.110 
here and then I'm going to use some
dimensionals<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.440> I'm<00:03:42.709> going<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.889> use<00:03:43.069> some

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
dimensionals so I'm going to use some

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.430 
dimensionals so I'm going to use some
pop<00:03:44.120> adhesive<00:03:44.569> and<00:03:44.629> I'm<00:03:44.750> running<00:03:45.019> low<00:03:45.139> on<00:03:45.170> this

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
pop adhesive and I'm running low on this

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.809 
pop adhesive and I'm running low on this
so<00:03:45.680> I'm<00:03:45.889> just<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.280> cut<00:03:46.489> off<00:03:46.609> these

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
so I'm just going to cut off these

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:56.220 
so I'm just going to cut off these
pieces<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.420> use<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:48.379> know<00:03:48.409> what's<00:03:48.680> left<00:03:54.639> and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
pieces and use you know what's left and

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.599 
pieces and use you know what's left and
then<00:03:57.230> I'll<00:03:57.349> just<00:03:57.500> go<00:03:57.680> ahead<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.040> layer<00:03:58.370> that

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
then I'll just go ahead and layer that

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.110 
then I'll just go ahead and layer that
and<00:03:58.879> I<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> use<00:03:59.329> this<00:03:59.480> shadow<00:03:59.840> of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and I like to use this shadow of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.280 
and I like to use this shadow of
whatever<00:04:02.120> image<00:04:02.419> i'm<00:04:02.540> using<00:04:02.870> because<00:04:03.139> it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
whatever image i'm using because it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.610 
whatever image i'm using because it
helps<00:04:04.129> it<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.840> fold<00:04:06.109> at<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.349> top

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
helps it so that the fold at the top

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.150 
helps it so that the fold at the top
isn't<00:04:06.919> like<00:04:07.280> folding<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.940> head<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:09.099> ok<00:04:10.099> so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
isn't like folding the head so ok so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.890 
isn't like folding the head so ok so
there's<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:11.180> last<00:04:11.359> thing<00:04:11.449> i<00:04:11.540> want<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.750> do

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
there's that the last thing i want to do

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.860 
there's that the last thing i want to do
is<00:04:11.930> add<00:04:12.230> some<00:04:12.639> white<00:04:13.639> stitching<00:04:14.180> around<00:04:14.359> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
is add some white stitching around the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.569 
is add some white stitching around the
outline<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.949> i'm<00:04:16.039> just<00:04:16.130> going<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:16.519> ahead

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
outline so i'm just going to go ahead

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.310 
outline so i'm just going to go ahead
and<00:04:16.729> do<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:19.299> ok<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:20.359> i<00:04:20.479> added<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.870> stitching

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320

and do that ok so i added the stitching
all<00:04:21.530> around<00:04:21.829> my<00:04:22.099> bird<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.760> did<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.090> right

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
all around my bird and I did that right

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.659 
all around my bird and I did that right
onto<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.960> card<00:04:24.229> base<00:04:24.410> itself<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.460> what<00:04:25.610> I'm

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
onto the card base itself so what I'm

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.839 
onto the card base itself so what I'm
going<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.940> next<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.449> add<00:04:27.729> just<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:28.820> little

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
going to do next is add just a little

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.860 
going to do next is add just a little
bit<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:30.099> dimension<00:04:31.099> by<00:04:31.580> adding<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.240> little

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
bit of dimension by adding a little

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020 
bit of dimension by adding a little
button<00:04:33.229> that<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.410> use<00:04:33.650> some<00:04:33.949> touring<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.699> and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
button that I use some touring on and
