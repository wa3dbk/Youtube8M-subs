00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the same time and I did obviously the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.150 
the same time and I did obviously the
galaxy<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.010> open<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.969> before<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.770> on<00:01:01.770> there

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
CNN at the top and as I go and a galaxy

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.320 
CNN at the top and as I go and a galaxy
is<00:01:09.479> loaded<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.340> then<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.729> other<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.119> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is loaded and then the other one is not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
is loaded and then the other one is not
too<00:01:12.540> far<00:01:12.570> behind<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.200> mean<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:14.100> two<00:01:14.220> hundred

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
too far behind I mean for two hundred

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
too far behind I mean for two hundred
dollars<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.659> thing's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
pretty quick it's not nearly as

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
pretty quick it's not nearly as
responsive<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.070> galaxy<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.610> again

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
responsive as the galaxy is but again

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.080 
responsive as the galaxy is but again
two<00:01:23.970> hundred<00:01:24.299> dollars<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:26.490> works<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:26.909> good

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
two hundred dollars it works pretty good

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
two hundred dollars it works pretty good

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I was that one back up anyway similar in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
I was that one back up anyway similar in
size<00:02:05.039> are<00:02:05.280> both<00:02:05.399> seven<00:02:05.759> inch<00:02:05.880> screens<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:08.539> mean

size are both seven inch screens I mean

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
size are both seven inch screens I mean
the<00:02:09.629> resolution<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.349> obviously<00:02:11.009> there's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the resolution is obviously there's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.090 
the resolution is obviously there's
quite<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> difference

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.680 

but<00:02:17.730> yeah<00:02:17.910> I'm<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.570> another
