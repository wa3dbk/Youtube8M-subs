old people kind of that they're always
confused<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.290> so<00:00:19.529> transplanting

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
confused about that so transplanting

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.900 
confused about that so transplanting
really<00:00:20.850> begin<00:00:21.270> sometime<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.290> Ohio<00:00:22.650> zone<00:00:23.430> six

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
really begin sometime in Ohio zone six

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.720 
really begin sometime in Ohio zone six
so<00:00:24.630> transplanting<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.800> begin<00:00:26.189> somewhere<00:00:26.460> on

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so transplanting here begin somewhere on

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.999 
so transplanting here begin somewhere on
mid<00:00:26.970> November<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:28.110> soon<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> hard

or once that happens that triggers

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.440 
or once that happens that triggers
plants<00:01:07.259> into<00:01:07.409> dormancy<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.180> like

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
plants into dormancy then it's like

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240 
plants into dormancy then it's like
doing<00:01:09.720> surgery<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> human<00:01:10.590> being<00:01:11.040> that's

doing surgery on a human being that's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
doing surgery on a human being that's
why<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.850> people<00:01:12.299> under<00:01:12.509> anesthesia<00:01:13.079> if

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
why you put people under anesthesia if

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.430 
why you put people under anesthesia if
you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> operate<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.510> cut<00:01:15.690> bones<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.380> do

go through here with the stain we can

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
go through here with the stain we can
sever<00:01:24.120> roots<00:01:24.510> we<00:01:24.690> can<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.140> burlap<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
already done the root damage so you can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
already done the root damage so you can
plant<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.830> thing<00:01:47.159> any<00:01:47.640> time<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.299> year

plant that thing any time of the year
long<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> ground<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.470> frozen<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.430> can

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
long as the ground is not frozen you can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.539 
long as the ground is not frozen you can
plan<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.299> don't<00:01:51.600> mix<00:01:51.870> up<00:01:52.430> transplanting<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
plan so don't mix up transplanting and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.310 
plan so don't mix up transplanting and
planning<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.659> there's<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> big<00:01:55.110> difference

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
planning that there's a big difference

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.370 
planning that there's a big difference
so<00:01:55.710> basically<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.030> doing<00:01:57.420> we've<00:01:58.229> got

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so basically what we're doing we've got

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.960 
so basically what we're doing we've got
a<00:01:58.409> bunch<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> these<00:01:58.799> Japanese<00:01:59.280> maples<00:01:59.729> today

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
a bunch of these Japanese maples today

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.789 
a bunch of these Japanese maples today
this<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> Japanese<00:02:01.200> maples

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this is this is a Japanese maples

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.160 
this is this is a Japanese maples
evening<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.520> red<00:02:02.729> seedling<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.720> also<00:02:03.900> have

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
evening just a red seedling we also have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.750 
evening just a red seedling we also have
some<00:02:04.350> blood<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.920> dug<00:02:05.100> those<00:02:05.280> over<00:02:05.610> there

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
some blood good we dug those over there

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.449 
some blood good we dug those over there
this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.600> green<00:02:06.930> cascade<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:07.890> we're<00:02:08.039> digging

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
this is green cascade so we're digging

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.850 
this is green cascade so we're digging
all<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.879> stuff<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.200> we've<00:02:10.379> got<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
all this stuff I don't know we've got a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.679 
all this stuff I don't know we've got a
few<00:02:11.009> hundred<00:02:11.159> pieces<00:02:11.459> left<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
few hundred pieces left here to go and

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.210 
few hundred pieces left here to go and
then<00:02:13.170> we're<00:02:13.379> what<00:02:13.560> we're<00:02:13.709> doing<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.099> now

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
then we're what we're doing for now

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.260 
then we're what we're doing for now
we're<00:02:14.459> taking<00:02:14.760> them<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.939> put

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
we're taking them to put

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.300 
we're taking them to put
over<00:02:15.480> here<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:18.570> container<00:02:18.990> area<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.830> sunk<00:02:20.160> in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
over here this container area is sunk in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.610 
over here this container area is sunk in
a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.670> bit<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.120> we're<00:02:21.780> putting<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.230> here

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
a little bit and we're putting in here

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
a little bit and we're putting in here
and<00:02:22.830> then<00:02:23.250> we're<00:02:23.460> just<00:02:23.490> dumping<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.480> bag

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and then we're just dumping the bag

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630 
and then we're just dumping the bag
leaves<00:02:25.200> we've<00:02:25.440> got<00:02:25.590> bags<00:02:25.800> lead<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.460> dump

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
leaves we've got bags lead to just dump

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
leaves we've got bags lead to just dump
them<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.940> top<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.840> works<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.290> an<00:02:28.440> insulator

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
them on top that works as an insulator

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
them on top that works as an insulator
that<00:02:29.190> helps<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.550> hold<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> some<00:02:30.120> moisture<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
that helps to hold in some moisture and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260 
that helps to hold in some moisture and
we'll<00:02:31.410> leave<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.710> there<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.100> spring<00:02:32.520> come

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
we'll leave them there to spring come

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
we'll leave them there to spring come
spring<00:02:33.600> they're<00:02:34.320> good<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.800> got<00:02:34.920> them

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
spring they're good to go we got them

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.250 
spring they're good to go we got them
setting<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.490> plastic<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.840> way<00:02:37.050> they

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
setting on plastic to that way they

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.470 
setting on plastic to that way they
can't<00:02:37.560> run<00:02:37.920> into<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.220> ground<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.060> we

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
can't run into the ground because if we

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.510 
can't run into the ground because if we
let<00:02:39.630> them<00:02:39.720> run<00:02:39.930> into<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> ground<00:02:40.350> then<00:02:41.310> we're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
let them run into the ground then we're

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.980 
let them run into the ground then we're
going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.790> root<00:02:42.030> damage<00:02:42.270> when<00:02:42.630> we<00:02:42.780> move

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
going to do root damage when we move

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.630 
going to do root damage when we move
them<00:02:43.140> again<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.620> that's<00:02:43.770> kind<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.160> important

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
them again so that's kind of important

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.700 
them again so that's kind of important
is<00:02:44.700> make<00:02:44.880> sure<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.240> don't<00:02:45.450> set<00:02:46.080> yourself<00:02:46.230> up

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
is make sure you don't set yourself up

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.310 
is make sure you don't set yourself up
you<00:02:47.280> know<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.910> happen<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.360> anyway

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you know for that to happen so anyway

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.950 
you know for that to happen so anyway
that's<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.400> short<00:02:50.910> segment<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.390> Monday's<00:02:51.720> with

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
that's a short segment of Monday's with

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.980 
that's a short segment of Monday's with
Mike<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.360> put<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.960> a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
Mike and I I'm going to put this on a

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.870 
Mike and I I'm going to put this on a
web<00:02:55.200> page<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.070> kind<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.550> explain

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
web page so that I can kind of explain

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.250 
web page so that I can kind of explain
how<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> detail<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.690> read<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.960> over<00:02:58.110> and
