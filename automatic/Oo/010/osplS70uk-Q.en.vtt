what up guys real touch team out here
back<00:00:02.280> with<00:00:02.429> another<00:00:02.520> Java<00:00:03.179> tutorial<00:00:03.810> today<00:00:04.020> we

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
back with another Java tutorial today we

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.860 
back with another Java tutorial today we
are<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.680> learning<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.870> import

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
are going to be learning how to import

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.140 
are going to be learning how to import
images<00:00:07.049> into<00:00:07.710> your<00:00:07.890> games<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:08.580> instead<00:00:08.970> of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
images into your games so instead of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.020 
images into your games so instead of
just<00:00:09.330> having<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.960> plain<00:00:10.710> blue<00:00:11.370> ball<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:11.910> we

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
just having this plain blue ball here we

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.490 
just having this plain blue ball here we
can<00:00:12.179> actually<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.540> an<00:00:12.660> image<00:00:14.990> like<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> sprite

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
can actually have an image like a sprite

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
can actually have an image like a sprite
so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.580> I've<00:00:17.699> done<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.119> imported<00:00:18.810> an

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
so what I've done is I've imported an

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.160 
so what I've done is I've imported an
image<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.529> called<00:00:19.830> an<00:00:19.949> images<00:00:20.340> out

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
image here I just called an images out

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.689 
image here I just called an images out
little<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> JPEG<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.039> named<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> images

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
little to JPEG I just named it images

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
little to JPEG I just named it images
and<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> face<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:24.990> here<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and it's the face right here it's just a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
and it's the face right here it's just a
normal<00:00:25.890> face<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.490> went<00:00:27.029> ahead<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
normal face and I just went ahead and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.820 
normal face and I just went ahead and
went<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> desktop<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:27.990> dragged<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.680> into

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
went to the desktop and dragged it into

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
went to the desktop and dragged it into
our<00:00:29.070> source<00:00:29.400> file<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.179> sure<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
our source file here make sure it's in

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
our source file here make sure it's in
your<00:00:30.660> source<00:00:30.960> file<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.239> yeah<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.809> gonna

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
your source file and yeah so we're gonna

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
your source file and yeah so we're gonna
go<00:00:34.079> ahead<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.590> go<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> player<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
go ahead and go to the player here and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
go ahead and go to the player here and
we're<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.850> add<00:00:36.090> two<00:00:36.570> variables<00:00:37.050> we're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
we're gonna add two variables we're

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.180 
we're gonna add two variables we're
gonna<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.440> private<00:00:39.230> URL<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:40.980> name

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and I'm just gonna name it player now

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.000 
and I'm just gonna name it player now
what<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.469> gonna<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.829> we're<00:00:49.950> gonna

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.520> constructor<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
create a constructor so I'm gonna do

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.740 
create a constructor so I'm gonna do
public<00:00:52.110> player<00:00:53.210> that's<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> need<00:00:54.539> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
public player that's all you need for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
public player that's all you need for
that<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.500> parameters<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.340> you're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that but in these parameters here you're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.760 
that but in these parameters here you're
going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> need<00:00:56.789> main<00:00:57.210> class<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.649> gonna

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
going to need main class and I'm gonna

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.220 
going to need main class and I'm gonna
call<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> variable<00:00:59.370> MC<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> gonna<00:01:00.870> refer

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
call the variable MC that is gonna refer

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
call the variable MC that is gonna refer
to<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.469> main<00:01:01.770> class<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to this main class here because the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
to this main class here because the
reason<00:01:03.629> why<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.129> need

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
reason why we do that is because we need

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.230 
reason why we do that is because we need
this<00:01:05.549> applet<00:01:06.380> import<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.700> need<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> refer

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this applet import and we need to refer

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
this applet import and we need to refer
to<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.570> main<00:01:09.780> class<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:11.310> we're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to this main class here so what we're

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
to this main class here so what we're
gonna<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:11.970> gonna<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.270> URL<00:01:12.900> equals

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
gonna do is we're gonna say URL equals

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
gonna do is we're gonna say URL equals
MC<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> variable<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.869> set<00:01:16.020> up

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
MC which is the variable we just set up

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.749 
MC which is the variable we just set up
here<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.710> referring<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> main<00:01:17.520> class

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
here so it's referring to the main class

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
here so it's referring to the main class
dot<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:20.540> document<00:01:21.979> base<00:01:24.200> okay<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:25.770> what

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
dot get document base okay and now what

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170 
dot get document base okay and now what
we're<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:26.490> gonna<00:01:26.549> say<00:01:27.920> Claire

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
we're gonna do is we're gonna say Claire

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.859 
we're gonna do is we're gonna say Claire
equals<00:01:31.250> MC<00:01:32.250> dot<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:33.409> image<00:01:34.759> URL<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.030> now

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
equals MC dot get image URL and now

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.590 
equals MC dot get image URL and now
here's<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.680> put<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.520> source<00:01:38.880> or

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
here's what we're put in the source or

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.690 
here's what we're put in the source or
the<00:01:39.720> path<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the path that it's at so we just have it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
the path that it's at so we just have it
in<00:01:41.790> our<00:01:41.880> source<00:01:42.150> file<00:01:42.329> salt<00:01:42.750> our<00:01:43.200> source<00:01:43.680> file

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
in our source file salt our source file

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.359 
in our source file salt our source file
so<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.759> need<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> images<00:01:45.630> dot<00:01:46.369> jpg

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
so all we need to do is images dot jpg

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.450 
so all we need to do is images dot jpg
and<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:48.509> sure<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.170> um<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.220> case

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and make sure this is um it's case

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.920 
and make sure this is um it's case
sensitive<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.299> sure<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.780> exactly

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
sensitive so make sure this is exactly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.399 
sensitive so make sure this is exactly
correct<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:53.880> once<00:01:54.119> we've<00:01:54.270> done<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.509> or

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
correct so now once we've done that or

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
correct so now once we've done that or
pretty<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:55.890> done<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.790> need<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pretty much done here and all we need to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.560 
pretty much done here and all we need to
do<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.390> draw<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.860> go<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> our<00:01:59.570> our

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
do is draw it now so if we go to our our

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
do is draw it now so if we go to our our
paint<00:02:00.899> class<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
paint class here you see we have the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
paint class here you see we have the
blue<00:02:03.149> ball<00:02:03.390> everything<00:02:04.290> we're<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.710> gonna

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
blue ball everything we're just gonna

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.190 
blue ball everything we're just gonna
delete<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.600> g<00:02:07.170> dot<00:02:07.849> draw<00:02:08.989> image

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.839 

we're<00:02:12.800> gonna<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.190> player<00:02:14.830> X<00:02:15.830> Y<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.209> then<00:02:17.599> MC

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
we're gonna do player X Y and then MC

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.910 
we're gonna do player X Y and then MC
but<00:02:19.849> in<00:02:20.060> order<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.599> we<00:02:20.780> need<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.080> again

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
but in order for that we need to again

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.089 
but in order for that we need to again
import<00:02:22.520> our<00:02:22.640> main<00:02:22.849> class<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.599> call<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.930> MC<00:02:24.380> and

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
import our main class and call it MC and

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.930 
import our main class and call it MC and
so<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:27.470> draw<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.770> image<00:02:28.160> which<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.459> our<00:02:28.700> player

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
so we draw the image which is our player

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.320 
so we draw the image which is our player
that<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:29.330> defined<00:02:29.750> up<00:02:29.959> here<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:31.489> our<00:02:31.670> x<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.120> y

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
that we defined up here on our x and y

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.960 
that we defined up here on our x and y
so<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.380> still<00:02:33.770> move<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.700> then

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so that we can still move it and then

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.330 
so that we can still move it and then
our<00:02:35.239> MC<00:02:35.780> which<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.290> referring<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.160> main

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
our MC which is referring to the main

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.100 
our MC which is referring to the main
class<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.239> go<00:02:38.390> back<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.810> see<00:02:39.019> we

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
class here so if we go back you see we

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.520 
class here so if we go back you see we
got<00:02:39.230> some<00:02:39.290> errors<00:02:39.800> here<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.780> says<00:02:41.959> P

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
got some errors here and it says P

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
class here and then you see a paint gene

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.640 
class here and then you see a paint gene
we<00:02:50.630> need<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.840> do<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.560> go
