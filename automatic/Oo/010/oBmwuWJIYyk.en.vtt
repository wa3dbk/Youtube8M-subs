00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.049
 and talk to everyone in the quiet 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 welcome to the fifa news channel 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 games brazil and people we see around 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.920
 anp big expensive players like 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.770
 cristiano ronaldo messi neymar and cousin 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 video for the start of fifa 16 is not 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.010
 everyone will have and these conditions 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 these more expensive players because 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.269
 because there are people who do not like it or not 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.760
 knows how to trade but there are people too. 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.859
 who buys fifa points he already buys with 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 that knows how to do very well trade and 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.249
 get these guys but for the big 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.429
 Most are from the very beginning then the 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:56.190
 most right level players are a bit 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.589
 less accessible and we will focus on 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.149
 players on the lower level and 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.339
 price is also lower than it will be enough 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.380
 used by those who are starting there 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 I'm not fifteen 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.550
 so come on, this video is basically 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 focused on the league live the Spanish league 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.760
 we started there with bigger nolito 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.980
 finisher of the league and after the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.650
 Messi and Christian Ronaldo 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.960
 he wins what he needs to move on fifa 15 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.380
 with very good status 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 the guy broke into this team box 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 of decision he puts the shirt 10 in celtic 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.180
 and play a lot of ball 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.700
 in fifa it's like left winnie it 's 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.910
 left but in the Celtic even in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.100
 he plays from left to right. 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.770
 midfield as a forward as 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.650
 Attacker, the guy is always fine. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.550
 always running and leading and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.370
 aim is very well trained and it is known 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.990
 where he puts the ball in pain then 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.050
 Cristiano Ronaldo was the one who scored 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 more goals from the league and finished 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.590
 enough and is the main player of the team 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.130
 on the attack if it is not the main 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.330
 all cast now he 's half already 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.020
 old more 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.730
 he is very strong he thinks the game 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.550
 he is with the ball and not counting 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.430
 finalization and the heading that are the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.980
 strengths it positions itself 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.560
 very well and that makes him the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.310
 center that the whole team plays for him 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.450
 after he has a pass 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.940
 awesome, I already told him some 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.610
 times there on my channel and the placement 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.040
 very little he is already a bit heavy 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.830
 is at an advanced age but 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.890
 you 're playing well and you deserve a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.930
 upgrade so that the next one gets started 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.990
 to fall back to retirement 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.050
 its the average charge of my ray shirt 10 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.810
 gameiro gamer friend he has been to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.560
 many teams actually at the beginning of the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.020
 fifa 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.960
 on my team mostly I just took 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.690
 even when it was time to put a top guy 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.060
 he is currently booking right but he is the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.090
 reserve that scored the most goals then 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.130
 Whenever the guy comes in he brand plays 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.980
 very unfortunately not yet won 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.590
 space at the time he was 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.720
 theoretically newly transferred but even 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.350
 so it deserves an upgrade for what it does 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.060
 in the field 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.740
 the state of the player is measured by what 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.690
 he does not field on the bench then 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.760
 When he enters, he breaks up with 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.709
 sure he always deserves great 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.450
 What helps a lot the first is that 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.730
 he is agile so he can 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.070
 position well and get rid of defender 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.810
 with more facility than one 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.820
 centered then heavier then 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.160
 usually after the other team is 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.400
 all tired he enters the second half 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.620
 and manages to do his miracles if I 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.610
 I 'm not mistaken he has eight goals until 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.260
 now 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.900
 the players I selected 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.240
 are these there are actually players 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.670
 I really like to play in the beginning. 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.670
 nolito he plays well mainly now 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.830
 pro fifa 16 after he moves his decision 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.560
 The pains he plays well, too. 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.230
 nods very well ends well 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.870
 The goalkeeper is always on my team. 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.450
 for sure it is the initial so the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.609
 a gold player that we start and 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.730
 become a team from france now if you do 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.370
 a team should viei can count on the guy 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.590
 that he commands very well and speaking also 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.140
 of other rains roberto trashorras there 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.160
 it actually if you like a team 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.560
 a little more 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.050
 You will not like it but if you 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.790
 put for example as second flywheel 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.130
 or as center sock 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.190
 the guy out there is the step that you 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.930
 You need in their midst field staff hope 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.850
