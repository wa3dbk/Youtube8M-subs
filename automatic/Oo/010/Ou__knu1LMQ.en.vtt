questions and we have some tips about
budgie<00:00:09.870> breeding<00:00:11.000> so<00:00:12.110> as<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.170> mentioned<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.740> my

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
budgie breeding so as I mentioned in my

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.400 
budgie breeding so as I mentioned in my
older<00:00:14.820> video<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.599> need<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.020> bonded

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
older video you need to have a bonded

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.370 
older video you need to have a bonded
pair<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:18.240> signs<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:18.810> botting<00:00:19.199> are

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
pair the some signs of them botting are

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
pair the some signs of them botting are
the<00:00:20.130> male<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.490> sing<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> female

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the male will sing to the female

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
the male will sing to the female
they<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.140> scratch<00:00:22.350> each<00:00:22.500> other's<00:00:22.590> heads<00:00:23.010> or

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
they will scratch each other's heads or

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.460 
they will scratch each other's heads or
the<00:00:23.760> male<00:00:23.910> will<00:00:24.150> regurgitate<00:00:24.619> food<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:26.099> her<00:00:26.250> um

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
the male will regurgitate food to her um

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
the male will regurgitate food to her um
and<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.949> once<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> bonded<00:00:29.609> pair<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and so once you have a bonded pair you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
and so once you have a bonded pair you
can<00:00:30.269> introduce<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.900> breeding<00:00:31.140> box<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
can introduce a breeding box that is of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
can introduce a breeding box that is of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
if you just want to have a bonded pair
but<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:36.840> want<00:00:37.110> them<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> lay<00:00:37.469> eggs<00:00:37.680> just

breeding box not a nest

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.880 
breeding box not a nest
I've<00:00:47.610> seen<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.420> youtubers<00:00:50.690> advertise<00:00:51.890> nests

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I've seen some youtubers advertise nests

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.819 
I've seen some youtubers advertise nests
as<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> good<00:00:54.000> option<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.600> strategies<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
as a good option for strategies that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
as a good option for strategies that
really<00:00:56.160> isn't<00:00:56.370> true<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:58.140> female

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really isn't true because a female

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
really isn't true because a female
budgie<00:00:59.160> won't<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.730> able<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> sit<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> it

want to make sure that the breeding box
itself<00:01:15.689> has<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:16.920> concave<00:01:17.759> cut<00:01:18.150> out

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
itself has this little concave cut out

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.390 
itself has this little concave cut out
so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> eggs<00:01:20.509> don't<00:01:21.509> roll<00:01:21.810> around<00:01:25.400> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so that the eggs don't roll around you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
so that the eggs don't roll around you
can<00:01:26.580> attach<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.090> breeding<00:01:27.479> box<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
can attach your breeding box on the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
can attach your breeding box on the
inside<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.619> cage<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> outside

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
inside of your cage or on the outside

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
inside of your cage or on the outside
that<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.329> depends<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> how<00:01:30.869> big<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.439> cage<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that just depends on how big the cage is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
that just depends on how big the cage is
itself<00:01:32.390> because<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.570> cage<00:01:33.780> isn't<00:01:34.170> too<00:01:34.439> big<00:01:34.619> we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
itself because my cage isn't too big we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
itself because my cage isn't too big we
attached<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> outside<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:37.040> wires

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
attached it on the outside with wires

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.030 
attached it on the outside with wires
and<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.659> cut<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.829> wires

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and we just cut out these little wires

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.999 
and we just cut out these little wires
so<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> hole<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.899> attached<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so that the hole is like attached to the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.910

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
same age it's good if one is younger one

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.820 
same age it's good if one is younger one
is<00:04:07.140> older<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.310> personally<00:04:09.300> as<00:04:09.510> an<00:04:09.690> EP<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.170> if

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
is older but personally as an EP that if

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.410 
is older but personally as an EP that if
it's<00:04:11.070> your<00:04:11.220> first<00:04:11.370> time<00:04:11.519> breeding<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.120> want

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
it's your first time breeding you want

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.240 
it's your first time breeding you want
to<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> successful<00:04:13.140> breeding<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.769> would

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
to have a successful breeding I would

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.879 
to have a successful breeding I would
recommend<00:04:14.640> getting<00:04:14.850> an<00:04:15.209> older<00:04:15.840> female<00:04:16.049> just

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
recommend getting an older female just

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:17.819 
recommend getting an older female just
because<00:04:17.190> um

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
because um

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.629 
because um
a<00:04:17.859> younger<00:04:18.549> female<00:04:18.930> could<00:04:19.930> lay<00:04:20.139> and<00:04:20.639> fertile

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
a younger female could lay and fertile

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.059 
a younger female could lay and fertile
eggs<00:04:21.849> or<00:04:22.240> could<00:04:23.199> not<00:04:23.229> take<00:04:23.590> care<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.919> eggs

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
eggs or could not take care of the eggs

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.909 
eggs or could not take care of the eggs
properly<00:04:24.449> so<00:04:25.449> I<00:04:25.479> think<00:04:25.689> and<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.439> female<00:04:26.770> is

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
properly so I think and a female is

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.700 
properly so I think and a female is
better<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:28.240> really<00:04:28.449> doesn't<00:04:28.870> matter<00:04:29.080> this

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
better but really doesn't matter this

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.399 
better but really doesn't matter this
pair<00:04:30.099> that<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.550> right<00:04:30.759> now<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:32.020> female<00:04:32.319> is

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
pair that I have right now the female is

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.719 
pair that I have right now the female is
actually<00:04:32.800> younger<00:04:33.159> and<00:04:33.400> they're<00:04:33.550> pretty

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
actually younger and they're pretty

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.929 
actually younger and they're pretty
successful<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.860> far<00:04:36.129> they<00:04:36.370> can<00:04:36.520> hang<00:04:36.729> around

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
successful so far they can hang around

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.899 
successful so far they can hang around
the<00:04:37.180> breeding<00:04:37.479> box<00:04:37.689> and<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.669> they've
