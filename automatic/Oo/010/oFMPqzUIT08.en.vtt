00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.340
 ah 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.859
 I always give a slap even if I remove it 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.450
 of the video but it 's like it's a tradition 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.830
 that you never see that I always do the test 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:18.679
 of a video I do not know is like a clapper 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:20.900
 something like that or it is already in 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.449
 today's video I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.640
 I'm sure it took time 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.400
 wishing I did in fact want to do it the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 last summer and for some reason not what 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.130
 I did and it's like doing a kimono you know 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.930
 that I like to be ambitious with the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.239
 projects that I like to be 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.600
 perfectionist do your best 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.969
 but in this case I have given up on that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 ability that I have to complicate it in 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.219
 life with the projects I have decided 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.260
 make it very very simple one version 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.870
 you can do all without machine 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.449
 sew without sewing absolutely nothing but 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.179
 with the trick as always there is a trick and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.969
 It is a glue thermo adhesive tape 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.379
 which serves to cut the lows of the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.170
 you can find it in 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.430
 any matter and it prevents you from sewing 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.180
 truth is that I do not know why not 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.520
 we use 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 material before because he has given me in 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.060
 mind that it is much cleaner than 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.430
 the textile glue itself is true that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 If the fabric is a little thick it costs a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.540
 little that hooks well and as for the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.700
 washed that is sure to me what 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 you ask in principle puts that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.660
 can wash and that there is no problem then 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.020
 nothing that if you want to see how you can 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.880
 make a kimono in your house 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.880
 Absolutely without sewing or a stitch 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.220
 stay to watch the video we go there with 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.110
 the kimono these are the measures that has 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.180
 used me for my kimono which is a 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.250
 one size but if you want it differently 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.259
 you can use this wrist measurement to 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.300
 doll that will be the width of the rectangle 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.360
 and then the length of this rectangle 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.070
 equivalent to the length of the kimono os 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.479
 you can try the fabric above 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.570
 you pay attention to my monkey to be at home 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.550
 please put the cloth on top and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.720
 You see how long you want for the kimono 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.130
 If you want me to reach you by the knee 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.300
 or if you want to have a little more 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.160
 short 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.320
 and now we extend the fabric well 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.240
 we fold in this way in half in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.490
 vertical 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.260
 and we helped ourselves with the pins so that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.990
 we left the cloth well folded and did not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.580
 move us when it comes to cutting I'm 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 using a kind of satin that is 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.940
 pretty slippery so it's 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.010
 It is essential to fix everything well 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.960
 how are you going to see the process is very very 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.700
 very similar to a video that I made 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.310
 a few months how to make a poncho blanket 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.320
 here we're also going to measure half with 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.750
 the vertical line and we're going to mark this 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.340
 center this point will give us the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.890
 depth of cut we have to 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 do 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 and now we are going to mark a line 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 parallel to the edge about 8 cm that will be 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 where we will have to cut what 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 we mark well with the rule with the chalk 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.430
 of tailor but anyway if something 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 it is not clear in terms of materials or 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.240
 As for measures I will leave you as 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.010
 always in the first link of the box 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.709
 of information the post of my blog where 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.240
 you have absolutely everything well detailed 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.890
 and this is the line where we will have 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.190
 that cut rounding off at the end for the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.190
 neck 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.560
 and we already have the pattern of our kimono 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.220
 now we unfold and we have one thing left 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.220
 A) Yes 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.040
 this is the fifth hem of the 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.020
 that spoke to you as you see is a little 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.730
 wide so I'm going to cut it by the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.730
 half to be able to adapt it better 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.390
 and we put our iron in the program 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.620
 of linen or cotton in this case I 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.330
 I'm using a fabric that is 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.920
 synthetic that is quite delicate and 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.290
 I would normally have to use the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.030
 nylon or silk program but as 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 we have to make this tape 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.420
 found well and paste I will use the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.400
 cotton program that is a 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.310
 highest temperature with a little bit of 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 Be careful with this tape we are going to bend 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.659
 all the edges inwards and the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.610
 let's fix we can also give you a 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.620
 double return so that everything is more 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.150
 polished this is important that you give a 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.769
 double return if you have a fabric that 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.380
 fray a bit like the one I'm 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.210
 using me 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.920
 for the double return we will put a 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.989
 little bit more tape and we will go back to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.180
 pass the iron and this is a trick that 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.650
 I invented myself on the fly 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.230
 that is not a super correct thing and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.180
 super orthodox but it 's quite comfortable and 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.190
 is to nail the pins on the table 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.050
 ironing so that when the iron is passed 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.900
 do not move the hem and do not 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.000
 we are left with the form that we do not want 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.040
 the most complicated in quotes because 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.780
 it's pretty easy, everything you see is 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.100
 do the curve of the neck and maybe in 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.960
 this moment you have to do some 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.280
 court cited to adapt it well but that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680
 also with the iron you can give 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.139
 well the form and we have the sleeves 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.300
 that we just have to close these 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.300
 ends of here and we have already finished 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.610
 we put the tape here as you see 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.319
 We are doing the same thing we do 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.449
 always to sew that is to face the 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.539
 good sides we help ourselves with pins 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.490
 and in this case I have also used 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.110
 double tape or I have picked up the tape 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.300
 and I've folded it in half so the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.400
 union is stronger and we have already 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.400
 finished now yes yes 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.120
 wait for the ideal video to start with 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.150
 a wave of water years because the sleeves 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.129
 they are like super flowin that bullshit 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.199
 I say sometimes 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.270
 The truth is that I am delighted with my 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.029
 new equipment, not that if you have a machine 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.580
 of sewing and I recommend that you amortize 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.319
 because although it seems that not with the 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.379
 nonsense so I spent a little bit of time 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.749
 there with the iron and evidently 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:06.089
 with the sewing machine is all I think 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:07.860
 which is safer but if you do not want 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.569
 arm yourself you have to do it for nothing 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.519
 you do not have to either get it by hand 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.589
 that actually handy either that 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.360
 it would take so long but it is more 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.709
 laborious if you have more patience then 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.360
 You can also sew it by hand, which is 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.709
 a very good option and until here the 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.019
 tutorial today I hope that I have you 

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:23.669
 liked and do not forget to leave me yours 

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.469
 likes below because it's the only way 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.509
 in which I can know if it has 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.789
 liked and you can also leave me under 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.610
 in comments if you want me to make a 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.889
 version of a kimono a little more pro with 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.139
 sewing machine already and with sleeves this 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.909
 kind of things because as you see this then 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.430
 Well it's like a manga but it's not a 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.350
 sleeve manga 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.960
 I could make a kimono like more with 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.090
 tea shape with its sleeves with its stuff 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.650
 still easy but already with the machine 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.840
 sew a little more advanced so if 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.420
 you interest me leave it in comments 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.730
 and what else I tell you then do not forget 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.130
 subscribe to the channel and see you in 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:02.440
 the next video 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.440
 I love you infinite
