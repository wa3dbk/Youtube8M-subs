product<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.800> creative<00:02:55.800> as<00:02:56.400> this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
product and I think as creative as this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.950 
product and I think as creative as this
motor<00:02:57.090> logging<00:02:57.600> community<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.370> uh<00:02:59.960> you

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
motor logging community is and uh you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.220 
motor logging community is and uh you
know<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.330> could<00:03:03.540> probably<00:03:03.780> find

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
know I think that we could probably find

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.020 
know I think that we could probably find
a<00:03:04.350> good<00:03:04.530> use<00:03:04.800> for<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.160> product

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
a good use for this product

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.449 
a good use for this product
and<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.690> know<00:03:07.750> like<00:03:08.170> when<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:09.160> when<00:03:09.340> he

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that you don't have to buy a slaughter

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.719 
that you don't have to buy a slaughter
nothing<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.400> get<00:04:40.699> motorized<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:42.430> by<00:04:43.430> all<00:04:43.490> these

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
nothing I get motorized it by all these

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.719 
nothing I get motorized it by all these
extra<00:04:44.180> parts<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.930> stuff<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.949> all<00:04:46.220> contained

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
extra parts and stuff it's all contained

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.810 
extra parts and stuff it's all contained
and<00:04:47.060> one<00:04:47.240> went<00:04:47.870> in<00:04:48.080> one<00:04:48.530> unit<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.699> when<00:04:52.699> you're

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and one went in one unit and when you're

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.900 
and one went in one unit and when you're
doing<00:04:53.120> time<00:04:53.360> lapse<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.229> it<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:55.400> moves

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
doing time lapse you don't it it moves

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.900 
doing time lapse you don't it it moves
so<00:04:56.479> it<00:04:56.630> gives<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:58.250> real<00:04:58.610> cool

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
so it gives you that that real cool

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.600 
so it gives you that that real cool
effect<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.810> zooming<00:05:00.289> in<00:05:00.440> or<00:05:00.470> out<00:05:00.770> or<00:05:00.800> moving<00:05:01.430> to

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
effect of zooming in or out or moving to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.610 
effect of zooming in or out or moving to
the<00:05:01.699> side<00:05:01.910> side

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.620 

and<00:05:06.160> I<00:05:06.280> think<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.760> know<00:05:06.790> this<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.120> just<00:05:07.300> a
