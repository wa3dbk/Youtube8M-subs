as<00:00:30.660> well

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
as well

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.530 
as well
that<00:00:31.470> should<00:00:31.830> spill<00:00:32.130> over<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> 1500

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that should spill over into the 1500

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.950 
that should spill over into the 1500
three<00:00:34.320> six<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> five<00:00:35.489> seven<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.780> this

three six and five seven as well so this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
three six and five seven as well so this
is<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.320> na<00:00:37.590> basically<00:00:38.460> stock<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> cold

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
is here na basically stock it has a cold

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410 
is here na basically stock it has a cold
air<00:00:39.809> kit<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:41.160> guess<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> catch-can<00:00:42.000> system

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
air kit and I guess a catch-can system

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.360 
air kit and I guess a catch-can system
and<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> test<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and we're going to test to see what it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
and we're going to test to see what it
makes<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> dyno<00:00:45.500> factory<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.219> going

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
makes on the dyno factory so I'm going

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
makes on the dyno factory so I'm going
to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> pass<00:00:47.760> real<00:00:47.969> quick<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to make a pass real quick and see what

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:48.340 
to make a pass real quick and see what
it's<00:00:48.690> about

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.130 

cool<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> yeah<00:01:51.150> that's<00:01:51.420> exactly<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:52.020> we

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
cool so yeah that's exactly what we

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.120 
cool so yeah that's exactly what we
expected<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.799> 260<00:01:53.729> 270<00:01:54.509> horsepower<00:01:55.130> there

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
expected about 260 270 horsepower there

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.310 
expected about 260 270 horsepower there
you<00:01:56.220> go<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.670> hundred<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> seventy<00:01:57.659> six<00:01:58.020> point

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you go two hundred and seventy six point

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.260 
you go two hundred and seventy six point
five<00:01:58.710> four<00:01:59.159> powers<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> wheels

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
five four powers the wheels

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.149 
five four powers the wheels
it<00:02:00.570> looks<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.080> making<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.649> under<00:02:01.950> two

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it looks like it's making just under two

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.680 
it looks like it's making just under two
hundred<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.640> eighty<00:02:02.850> pounds<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.330> torque<00:02:03.479> as

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
hundred and eighty pounds of torque as

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.719 
hundred and eighty pounds of torque as
well<00:02:03.869> very<00:02:04.080> flat<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.700> know

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
well very flat so it's a very you know

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.789 
well very flat so it's a very you know
sort<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> mild<00:02:06.600> car<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> drive<00:02:07.229> around<00:02:07.409> when

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sort of mild car to drive around when

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
sort of mild car to drive around when
you're<00:02:07.920> driving<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.340> vehicle<00:02:08.489> round<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you're driving this vehicle round you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.420 
you're driving this vehicle round you
can<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:10.020> predictably<00:02:10.649> drive

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
can just you know very predictably drive

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
can just you know very predictably drive
eight<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.850> what<00:02:12.330> were<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.630> expecting<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.260> do

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
eight so what were you expecting to do

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
eight so what were you expecting to do
here<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.800> adding<00:02:14.130> at<00:02:14.250> least<00:02:14.519> 100<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> 130

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
here is adding at least 100 to 130

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.150 
here is adding at least 100 to 130
horsepower<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> wheels<00:02:16.769> with<00:02:17.069> our

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
horsepower at the wheels with our

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
horsepower at the wheels with our
supercharger<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> look<00:02:18.720> forward<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> doing

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
supercharger so I look forward to doing

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.000 
supercharger so I look forward to doing
that<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.040> I'll<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.819> dyno
