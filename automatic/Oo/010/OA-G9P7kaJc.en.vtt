00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.410
 we wanted to get out of the tonic 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.070
 usual to bring the first phases 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070
 Of the same 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.089
 basically 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:33.769
 so good let's see the popular 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:44.030
 to connect the standard 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.790
 great because in any module that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.920
 be in the market 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.920
 you can have the express pci that 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.739
 are not certified by ourselves 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.739
 may develop 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:13.030
 the most important part would be that the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.330
 modules click on these are about 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 owners 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.820
 by property connectivity 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.229
 the gps and depends on anything from the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.229
 memory of the simple 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.550
 when we connect in four triples 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.610
 it's amazing from possibilities in 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.610
 Regarding device growth 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.000
 about me going back to work 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.310
 in operating systems that allow us 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 open and provide the community with the uses 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 necessary for them to be able to 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.690
 investigate and interact whatever you want 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 we will also provide 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.350
 closed software or that's because it has 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.790
 compiled so that less users 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.580
 advanced 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.519
 I like to dedicate is already available for 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.930
 your reservation in the middle art dotcom and 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.900
 there we can reserve and configure 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.630
 our product with just a name and 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.580

 we will contact all the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.760
 users who have sued their 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.380
 budget or they have connected for 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.550
 make your own device and you 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.709
 we will provide the opportunity to be able to 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.420
 buy according to price band 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.310
 we would be talking, we are talking about 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 it is the highest-end device 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.630
 we talk about resolutions of 2500 per 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.600
 1600 4g 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:04.050
 is 8 gigs 64 128 storage 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.710
 we can be around 750 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.030
 arranging in turn also of 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.030
 much cheaper devices
