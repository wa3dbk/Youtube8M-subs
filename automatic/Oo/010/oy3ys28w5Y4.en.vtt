00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello how about you guys now let's see a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.980
 trick here in origin with my every time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.170
 we can do endless rounds 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.700
 we will have to come here the route 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.559
 that you see that I follow here we will try 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
 that we pull the clamp without being caught 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 well we will make sure that if you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.500
 we get enough advantage we 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.539
 will re-launch the clamp we hope 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 a little bit and we went for legs until the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 where I said I stop myself behind 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 this little corner we will go out and enter 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.849
 we will go out and enter like that so that we 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.579
 release the clip and then shoot with 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.320
 the b-23 rr to let us go we will go up 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.870
 by the corner of this wall we will stick 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 a jump to the roof that and we 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 we will drop this area here we will do 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 an absolutely perfect action heap 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 where no road will take off 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.219
 panzer will not shoot us at that fire 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.219
 we can take the bonuses 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.370
 and every time the big giant passes 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.200
 he will kill them if we do the thing about the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.879
 three to pass every 30 seconds are 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.920
 endless rounds without touching 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.440
 the command so the truth is the trick 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.730
 is a true data object to have in 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 account here where you see that for a 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.259
 screen can be two companions 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.580
 there on top and not generate a lot 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.500
 nation the only heap action that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.540
 will generate is that of the partner who is 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.070
 down another partner can stay 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
 here on the roof where you see that for 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.960
 now the image would be three and the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.490
 Finally it stays where I'm staying 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 with the character since he was alone in 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 the game and someone had to do it 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 heap action 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.450
 small details to keep in mind 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.880
 so that the b-23 r is easier for you 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.189
 essential to let go of the bread be very 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.619
 easy to take the marathon to get him out 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.380
 much advantage to the panzer and when 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.200
 you come to the site go out and enter go out and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.520
 enter to cut the clip of the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.740
 pincers tricks this is the most 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.049
 easy that I have seen and above is the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 more effective is a tricky trick if 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.079
 we want to do it in the infinities because 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.280
 first you would have to prepare the canes 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.439
 and all the roll before coming to do 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 the trick but today the charge wants something 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.069
 it costs him so nothing guys hope that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.470
 I like that it helps you to make a fist 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.709
 very fat of rounds a saludito and until 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.709
 the next
