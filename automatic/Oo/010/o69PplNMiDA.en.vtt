control<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:41.949> for<00:00:42.340> us<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.789> all<00:00:42.940> starts<00:00:43.270> with<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
control so for us it all starts with a

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.540 
control so for us it all starts with a
two<00:00:43.690> pass<00:00:43.930> approach<00:00:44.379> putting<00:00:45.039> something<00:00:45.370> down

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
two pass approach putting something down

for<00:00:45.730> grass<00:00:46.120> control<00:00:46.570> if<00:00:46.629> you're<00:00:46.719> doing

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
for grass control if you're doing

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.349 
for grass control if you're doing
tillage<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.590> may<00:00:47.800> be<00:00:47.859> Sandlin<00:00:48.550> if<00:00:48.940> you're<00:00:49.180> not

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
doing tillage it's probably prowl but

you have for a choice here is Spartan I

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.170 
you have for a choice here is Spartan I
would<00:01:31.659> put<00:01:31.869> out<00:01:32.020> Spartan<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.920> Sanne<00:01:33.729> Lenore

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
would put out Spartan and Sanne Lenore

Prowler<00:01:34.450> treflan<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.200> do<00:01:35.439> two<00:01:36.220> things<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:37.000> get

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
Prowler treflan so do two things you get

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.910 
Prowler treflan so do two things you get
the<00:01:37.180> grass<00:01:37.630> control<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.229> get<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.470> broadleaf

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
the grass control you get the broadleaf

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.560 
the grass control you get the broadleaf
control<00:01:39.310> because<00:01:39.610> post<00:01:39.880> emerge<00:01:40.210> for<00:01:40.360> broad

leaves<00:01:40.780> there's<00:01:41.290> just<00:01:41.619> nothing<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.610> do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.700 
leaves there's just nothing you can do
now<00:01:43.180> certainly<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.899> could<00:01:44.200> plant<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
now certainly you could plant the

now certainly you could plant the
express<00:01:45.280> Sun<00:01:45.640> sunflower<00:01:46.329> so<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.719> could<00:01:46.840> use

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
express Sun sunflower so you could use

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.260 
express Sun sunflower so you could use
Express<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.439> could<00:01:47.829> plant<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.520> clear<00:01:48.969> field

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
Express you could plant the clear field

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.300 
Express you could plant the clear field
sunflowers<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.200> could<00:01:50.350> use<00:01:50.500> beyond<00:01:50.920> but

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
sunflowers so you could use beyond but

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.859 
sunflowers so you could use beyond but
we<00:01:51.399> don't<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.729> lot<00:01:51.969> of<00:01:52.000> options<00:01:52.299> there

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
don't get real good crop canopy so you

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.190 
don't get real good crop canopy so you
need<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.729> have<00:02:06.880> great<00:02:07.360> weed<00:02:07.570> control<00:02:07.990> with

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
need to do a great job with a burn down

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.300 
need to do a great job with a burn down
in<00:02:22.150> many<00:02:22.480> cases<00:02:23.020> it's<00:02:23.230> straight<00:02:23.740> roundup

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

there<00:02:24.640> won't<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:24.910> any<00:02:25.150> residual<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.200> soil

that<00:02:26.560> could<00:02:27.010> ding<00:02:27.370> those<00:02:27.670> sunflowers<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.510> down

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that could ding those sunflowers up down

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.030 
that could ding those sunflowers up down
the<00:02:28.960> road<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.500> need<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.740> be<00:02:29.860> cautious

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the road so you do need to be cautious

the road so you do need to be cautious
about<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.760> but<00:02:30.970> getting<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.330> good<00:02:31.510> burn

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
about that but getting that good burn

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
about that but getting that good burn
down<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> big<00:02:32.620> big<00:02:32.890> deal<00:02:33.130> if<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.700> kill

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
down is a big big deal if you can kill

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.850 
down is a big big deal if you can kill
that<00:02:34.060> first<00:02:34.360> flush<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.780> weeds<00:02:34.990> there<00:02:35.440> probably

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
that first flush of weeds there probably

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.650 
that first flush of weeds there probably
won't<00:02:36.100> be<00:02:36.220> as<00:02:36.430> many<00:02:36.580> coming<00:02:37.000> later<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.360> well

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
won't be as many coming later on well

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
won't be as many coming later on well
that's<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.080> boy<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> was<00:02:39.100> pretty<00:02:39.250> easy<00:02:39.370> we'd

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
that's it boy that was pretty easy we'd

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.610 
that's it boy that was pretty easy we'd
only<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> lot<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.510> choices<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.900> sunflowers

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.500 
only have a lot of choices in sunflowers
you<00:02:42.070> see<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.760> simple<00:02:43.090> discussion

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
you see that this is a simple discussion

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.900 
you see that this is a simple discussion
but<00:02:44.260> here's<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.770> big<00:02:44.950> problem<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:45.670> run

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
but here's the big problem that we run

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.150 
but here's the big problem that we run
into<00:02:46.120> okay<00:02:46.570> we<00:02:46.720> told<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.709> put

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
into okay we told you you have to put

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.370 
into okay we told you you have to put
down<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.880> pre-emerge<00:02:49.330> herbicides<00:02:49.780> one<00:02:50.200> for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
down to pre-emerge herbicides one for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.930 
down to pre-emerge herbicides one for
broad<00:02:50.500> leaves<00:02:50.709> one<00:02:50.860> for<00:02:51.040> grass<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
broad leaves one for grass you have to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820 
broad leaves one for grass you have to
do<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.209> there's<00:02:52.690> no<00:02:52.900> question<00:02:53.260> about<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.500> but

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
do it there's no question about it but

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.010 
do it there's no question about it but
the<00:02:53.920> difficulty<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.640> when<00:02:54.910> we're<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.720> lot<00:02:55.900> of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
the difficulty is when we're in a lot of

area in a drier area of the country

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.630 
area in a drier area of the country
you're<00:03:34.900> done<00:03:35.260> your<00:03:35.680> yields<00:03:36.010> are<00:03:36.100> going<00:03:36.340> way

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
you're done your yields are going way

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.580 
you're done your yields are going way
down<00:03:36.670> you've<00:03:37.209> got<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.900> have<00:03:38.110> good<00:03:38.350> weed

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
down you've got to have good weed

down you've got to have good weed
control<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.430> sunflowers<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:40.390> more

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
control and then sunflowers it's more

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.300 
control and then sunflowers it's more
important<00:03:41.110> than<00:03:41.140> wheat<00:03:41.410> it's<00:03:41.650> more<00:03:41.950> important

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
important than wheat it's more important

than<00:03:42.340> corn<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.910> more<00:03:43.150> important<00:03:43.480> than

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
than corn it's more important than

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.420 
than corn it's more important than
soybeans<00:03:43.989> because<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.410> got<00:03:44.560> horrible<00:03:45.130> crop

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
soybeans because you got horrible crop

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.979 
soybeans because you got horrible crop
canopy<00:03:45.730> there<00:03:46.090> there's<00:03:46.330> nothing<00:03:46.690> else<00:03:46.810> that's

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
canopy there there's nothing else that's

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.539 
canopy there there's nothing else that's
gonna<00:03:47.140> kill<00:03:47.410> those<00:03:47.560> weeds<00:03:47.890> other<00:03:48.220> than

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
gonna kill those weeds other than

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.610 
gonna kill those weeds other than
herbicide<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.269> tillage<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.989> most<00:03:50.350> people

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
herbicide or tillage and most people

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.900 
herbicide or tillage and most people
don't<00:03:50.709> want<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:51.010> tillage<00:03:51.370> anymore<00:03:51.730> so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
don't want to do tillage anymore so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.250 
don't want to do tillage anymore so
you're<00:03:52.030> left<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.269> herbicides<00:03:52.750> well<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
you're left with herbicides well and the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080 
you're left with herbicides well and the
good<00:03:53.440> thing<00:03:53.650> too<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.130> use<00:03:54.489> rotation

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
good thing too is you can use rotation

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.940 
good thing too is you can use rotation
to<00:03:55.209> your<00:03:55.330> benefit<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.930> rotate<00:03:56.560> with<00:03:56.739> other

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
to your benefit and rotate with other

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.860 
to your benefit and rotate with other
crops<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.640> can<00:03:57.760> do<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.850> great<00:03:58.060> job<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.630> weed

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
crops or you can do a great job on weed

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.600 
crops or you can do a great job on weed
control<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.560> when<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.739> get<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.920> sunflowers

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
control so when you get to sunflowers

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.160 
control so when you get to sunflowers
there<00:04:00.790> aren't<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.150> many<00:04:01.209> weed<00:04:01.600> seeds<00:04:01.930> out

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
there aren't that many weed seeds out

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.600 
there aren't that many weed seeds out
there<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.560> are<00:04:02.680> going<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.890> be<00:04:03.040> germinating

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
there that are going to be germinating

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.310 
there that are going to be germinating
that's<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.030> best<00:04:04.239> way<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.420> do<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.959> wouldn't

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
that's the best way to do it I wouldn't

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.289 
that's the best way to do it I wouldn't
put<00:04:05.500> sunflowers<00:04:06.040> into<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.430> we<00:04:06.670> deist<00:04:06.970> field

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
put sunflowers into my we deist field

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.880 
put sunflowers into my we deist field
but<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.720> would<00:04:07.959> put<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.440> field<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.709> I've

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
but I would put it in a field that I've

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.560 
but I would put it in a field that I've
had<00:04:09.070> for<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> few<00:04:09.400> years<00:04:09.579> that<00:04:09.850> I've<00:04:10.060> kept<00:04:10.329> weeds

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
had for a few years that I've kept weeds

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.000 
had for a few years that I've kept weeds
under<00:04:10.750> control<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> know<00:04:11.620> I've<00:04:11.829> got<00:04:11.980> a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
under control so I know I've got a

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.009 
under control so I know I've got a
better<00:04:12.250> likelihood<00:04:12.850> of<00:04:12.880> success<00:04:13.329> well<00:04:13.690> one<00:04:13.930> of

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
better likelihood of success well one of

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.539 
better likelihood of success well one of
the<00:04:14.079> weeds<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.650> may<00:04:14.980> see<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.400> your

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
the weeds that you may see in your

the weeds that you may see in your
sunflower<00:04:15.970> field<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.479> our<00:04:16.930> weight<00:04:17.140> of<00:04:17.260> the
