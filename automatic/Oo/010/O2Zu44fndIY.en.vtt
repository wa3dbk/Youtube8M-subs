00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.150 
you'll see we're using a DF
Green<00:04:28.000> that's<00:04:28.330> right<00:04:28.690> here<00:04:29.050> we<00:04:29.710> could<00:04:29.830> use<00:04:30.010> any

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
Green that's right here we could use any

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.150 
Green that's right here we could use any
color<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.550> we<00:04:30.760> want<00:04:30.940> we'll<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.390> using<00:04:31.540> D<00:04:31.900> F

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
color that we want we'll be using D F

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.730 
color that we want we'll be using D F
orange<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.030> example<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:35.260> have<00:04:35.410> three

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
orange in this example you have three

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.010 
orange in this example you have three
different<00:04:36.070> sizes<00:04:36.250> D<00:04:36.820> F<00:04:36.940> large<00:04:37.180> medium<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
different sizes D F large medium and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.060 
different sizes D F large medium and
small<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:39.310> have<00:04:39.600> one<00:04:40.600> shape

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
small and you have one shape

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.770 
small and you have one shape
specification<00:04:42.070> D<00:04:42.310> F<00:04:42.400> rounded<00:04:42.850> so<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.960> example

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
specification D F rounded so for example

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.300 
specification D F rounded so for example
right<00:04:46.780> here<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.500> large<00:04:47.970> black

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
right here this is a large black

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.460 
right here this is a large black
rectangular<00:04:51.310> shape<00:04:51.930> whereas<00:04:52.930> here<00:04:53.170> this<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.440> a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
rectangular shape whereas here this is a

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.120 
rectangular shape whereas here this is a
large<00:04:53.860> orange<00:04:54.840> rounded<00:04:55.840> shape<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.010> can

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
large orange rounded shape so you can

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.670 
large orange rounded shape so you can
configure<00:05:00.640> it<00:05:00.880> in<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.210> few<00:05:01.390> different<00:05:01.480> ways<00:05:01.720> if

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
configure it in a few different ways if

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.290 
configure it in a few different ways if
you<00:05:02.800> click<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.190> button<00:05:03.250> generator<00:05:04.000> you<00:05:04.270> can

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
you click this button generator you can

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.520 
you click this button generator you can
get<00:05:04.660> even<00:05:05.320> more<00:05:06.420> examples<00:05:07.420> so<00:05:07.720> if<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.020> I've

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
get even more examples so if you I've

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.800 
get even more examples so if you I've
already<00:05:08.710> opened<00:05:08.920> that<00:05:09.220> page

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
already opened that page

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.480 
already opened that page
it<00:05:11.260> starts<00:05:11.860> with<00:05:12.040> bi<00:05:12.730> and<00:05:13.920> this<00:05:14.920> will<00:05:15.070> format

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
it starts with bi and this will format

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.110 
it starts with bi and this will format
the<00:05:15.670> button<00:05:15.940> so<00:05:16.090> we<00:05:16.240> have<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:17.080> black<00:05:17.380> button

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the button so we have the black button

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.290 
the button so we have the black button
rectangular<00:05:19.120> shape<00:05:19.360> large<00:05:20.140> medium<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.680> small

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
rectangular shape large medium and small

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.120 
rectangular shape large medium and small
rounded<00:05:22.300> shape<00:05:22.540> large<00:05:22.990> medium<00:05:23.410> and<00:05:23.500> small<00:05:23.590> and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
rounded shape large medium and small and

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.510 
rounded shape large medium and small and
so<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:25.690> can<00:05:25.870> use<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.350> to<00:05:26.620> actually<00:05:26.650> create

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
so you can use this to actually create

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.150 
so you can use this to actually create
the<00:05:27.730> links<00:05:28.060> dynamically<00:05:28.780> or<00:05:28.990> if<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.830> want<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
the links dynamically or if I want to

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.900 
the links dynamically or if I want to
put<00:05:30.310> more<00:05:31.740> information<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.310> can<00:05:33.460> put<00:05:33.640> that<00:05:33.730> in

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
put more information you can put that in

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.050 
put more information you can put that in
there<00:05:34.110> link<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.320> details<00:05:35.650> page<00:05:35.830> click<00:05:36.820> go

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
there link to the details page click go

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.680 
there link to the details page click go
and<00:05:37.330> then<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.780> formats<00:05:38.530> all<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.920> those<00:05:39.690> links

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and then it formats all of those links

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.740 
and then it formats all of those links
so<00:05:40.840> you<00:05:40.930> just<00:05:41.200> need<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.590> grab<00:05:41.770> this<00:05:42.640> code<00:05:43.450> here

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
so you just need to grab this code here

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.030 
so you just need to grab this code here
and<00:05:43.930> paste<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.500> into<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:46.110> template<00:05:47.110> area<00:05:47.230> I'm

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
and paste it into the template area I'm

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.110 
and paste it into the template area I'm
just<00:05:48.250> going<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.430> show<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.580> how<00:05:48.730> to<00:05:48.760> do<00:05:48.970> it

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
just going to show you how to do it

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.380 
just going to show you how to do it
without<00:05:49.630> using<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:51.670> said<00:05:51.730> I<00:05:51.850> want

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
to have a large orange rounded button

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.190 
to have a large orange rounded button
and<00:05:57.880> I'm<00:05:58.300> going<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.450> change<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.810> text<00:05:58.990> on<00:05:59.170> it
