30<00:01:06.150> year<00:01:06.479> old<00:01:06.720> let<00:01:07.500> me<00:01:07.619> try

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.410 

hi<00:01:15.880> what's<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.120> weather<00:01:17.300> now

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.340 

even<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:26.790> mean<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:28.060> know<00:01:28.210> live<00:01:28.510> demos<00:01:28.960> are<00:01:29.110> hard

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.410 
even I mean you know live demos are hard
but<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.860> have<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.040> little<00:01:30.220> bit<00:01:30.490> back<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:31.000> think

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
but I have a little bit back I think

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.210 
but I have a little bit back I think
this<00:01:31.570> looks<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.230> aiming<00:01:32.770> for<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> teen

this looks like is aiming for a teen
market<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.880> think<00:01:34.420> shooting<00:01:34.870> for<00:01:35.140> 20<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.560> 30

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
market I think shooting for 20 to 30

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.250 
market I think shooting for 20 to 30
might<00:01:36.190> be<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.880> demographic<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:38.020> want<00:01:38.170> to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
might be a demographic that you want to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.680 
might be a demographic that you want to
look<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.620> little<00:01:38.950> bit<00:01:39.160> okay<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.450> also

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
look at a little bit okay and I also

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.469 
look at a little bit okay and I also
think<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:42.160> know<00:01:42.280> with<00:01:42.610> Sasha<00:01:42.850> testing

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
think that you know with Sasha testing

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.360 
think that you know with Sasha testing
it<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:43.840> sort<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.140> points<00:01:44.500> out<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.010> fact<00:01:45.040> that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
it it sort of points out the fact that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.910 
it it sort of points out the fact that
semantic<00:01:46.000> search<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.479> very<00:01:46.690> difficult<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.770> has

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
semantic search is very difficult it has

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
semantic search is very difficult it has
to<00:01:48.070> be<00:01:48.100> absolutely<00:01:48.370> perfect<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.420> order<00:01:49.570> for

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
to be absolutely perfect in order for

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020 
to be absolutely perfect in order for
the<00:01:49.870> app<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.260> work<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:51.250> personally<00:01:51.700> would

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
the app to work and I personally would

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.090 
the app to work and I personally would
be<00:01:52.150> more<00:01:52.390> likely<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.840> invest<00:01:53.410> as<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.740> later

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
be more likely to invest as a later

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.980 
be more likely to invest as a later
stage<00:01:54.520> investment<00:01:55.060> rather<00:01:55.390> than<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.690> seed

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
stage investment rather than a seed

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.469 
stage investment rather than a seed
stage<00:01:56.290> but<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.800> would<00:01:57.250> possibly<00:01:57.729> invest<00:01:58.300> in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
stage but I would possibly invest in

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.630 
stage but I would possibly invest in
this<00:01:58.630> if<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.960> works<00:01:59.140> very<00:01:59.380> well<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.009> if<00:02:00.430> the
