00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 class which you see I am 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.400
 level 10 in the game so here I go 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.800
 show you my first class for 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.940
 play fighting knife on call of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.739
 duty ghost so here is the first so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.740
 I want to take I'll just change 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.990
 this one here so you'll put 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.780
 already the fighting knife so imperative 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.200
 where other fights in secondary weapons 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 so you do not put anything here 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 all a mortal 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230
 you just put the shot both 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
 launched in tactics it's like you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.570
 do you want so you can put the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 flash grenades 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.100
 the stun grenades it can be 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.990
 good when you want to have the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.049
 flash or paralyzing 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.150
 I put the motion sensor as 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.170
 that's good I capture you the movements of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.390
 enemies coming by glass to the bar 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 month otherwise you are told that my breeding 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 or paralyzing 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.400
 I'm going to m the motion sensor on 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.730
 we all have we all 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.800
 we have all you are going you are going 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.890
 so marathon since for now 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.120
 I have that marathon so the better I think 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.830
 marathon handling so for the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.840
 handling I will take big arms 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.640
 so you launch go farther 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.570
 so I think it can be pretty good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.430
 have to test that bah you think I 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.660
 put discretion so clean up kill your 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.830
 enemies are unveiled the place of their 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.860
 dead you do not have to put it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210
 I do not think you can listen to it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.950
 also bring to the knowledge of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.470
 misions suffered explosive damage are 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 marked that that can be is also useful 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 I think resistance so insensitive to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 damage above that you can 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.760
 put we'll be able to remove the costs 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 stay to see if we can put other 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.940
 thing for gamblers no we're going nothing m 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 for equipment if you want 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 put if you can put two 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
 2 paralyzing flash grenades you 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.270
 activate this one so I'm going 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.430
 activated it's just for you 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.720
 show I already think with that in addition 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.170
 you can put you can put 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.820
 many 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.770
 so here you can downright 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.700
 choose everything if you want to be the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.500
 no more possible 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 finally the best possible to play at 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
 knife to put everything for example I 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 put I added discretion I'm going 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.720
 add that actually I if you want 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.459
 you can click on his call of duty 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.950
 got and that that can be interesting 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.080
 but I do not think all of them are all 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.459
 everything is finally like you 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.320
 would surprise me you can all used 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.370
 still for blow all that is useless 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.290
 to put all the assets so here I am 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.630
 what I advise you for this 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.440
 first class I think with that that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.600
 can not hurt 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.090
 in terms of that equipment 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 fight so assaults me I have no 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.250
 preference you can put the support 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.630
 as you want specialist also me 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.120
 I will rather go on sage 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.500
 I think so I'll start with the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.380
 right to worry the drone 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.510
 the dog who is not bad too and there from 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.460
 blow I had put crazy juggernaut so 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
 knife experts with armor so that 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.790
 it may not be bad for the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.080
 for the knife parties me I you 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.010
 advise to put that after you do 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.560
 what you want there was little 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.720
 of importance to unlock you see 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.800
 the biggest stomach that is the lot 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.740
 who will you need 15 tokens so a little 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.690
 it will do a lot of parts 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.670
 on the on the game so after it's like 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.650
 you want but me, I invite you 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.480
 to use this class if it's the case 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.040
 please do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.410
 in the comments if you test it 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.080
 do not hesitate to tell me if it works 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.630
 I really hated a little bit 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.770
 that night I tested the the throw of 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.810
 knives so the knife throwing that 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.370
 is really nothing to do with the bo2 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.050
 so I think it will take a little 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.620
 drive for me to show you 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.450
 a knife gameplay so for 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.120

 alarm that I will propose to you so at 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.200
 so do not hesitate to tell me 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.020
 in the comments what you want 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.060

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.250
 of tears so that's me so I you
