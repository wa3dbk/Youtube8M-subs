00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello to all that today I find 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.269
 to make you a new video 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 challenge so it looks like I'm going 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
 launch a tradition on the chain because 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.120
 that end of August beginning of September 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 every time there is a video challenge of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 manor for two years so we do not know 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 who maybe it's next year he 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.720
 will be a new challenge but in all 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.430
 case this year I find you utter 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.050
 challenge a little different from the one who 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 takes place last year because 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.180
 last year and that audrey from the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.400
 passionate reader channel 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 we did the challenge one year without purchase 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.859
 which consisted in not buying 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.629
 books for a year 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.010
 so I managed this challenge you in 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.479
 have already spoken a little bit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.889
 and there with audrey we decided to do 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.600
 a new challenge so we will do 

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:41.129
 our separate videos because I decided 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.109
 to put some small restrictions 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.329
 and I'm going to change a few small 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.190
 things for me not have my studies and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.479
 company but you can see the video 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.459
 Audrey I leave you in the bar 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.049
 information do not hesitate anyway 

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.979
 case we decided so proud to launch 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.690
 in this challenge 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.429
 do not hesitate to join us if it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.589
 makes you happy then the challenge 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.329
 will take place from 1 September 2015 so 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.709
 it's the end of my challenge 0 purchases 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 that's why we pretty much put the 

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:06.899
 same dates until September 1st, 2016 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.299
 the goal is to read 12 books for 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.130
 then have the right to a purchase on bed 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.869
 12 pounds one has a purchase simply 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 the principle is very simple except that me 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 I want to put a little restriction 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 special 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 I have to read 12 pounds of masts 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.579
 blades and not school books 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.770
 knowing that one studies letters 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.899
 inevitably I have a lot of classics and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.189
 company to study but one his books 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.289
 will not count in my challenge he 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.749
 I have to read 12 years old who are in 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.289
 my pale and not 12 pounds of books 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:32.700
 school 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.020
 that's because otherwise the books 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 schooling actually it does not bring down 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.380
 masts blades so it must be well 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.009
 12 pounds of my pale and not of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.749
 school books 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.640
 it's a little bit of a problem because 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.170
 that I will of course have to read some 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 books for the pleasure of the books that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 I have in my hand but do not count 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 school books it's going to be very 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 difficult because I still read 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.600
 not bad for the courses we also have a 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.219
 small specificity to the challenge so in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.719
 we will have incarnated we have noted the 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.609
 books we read we note for example 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.350
 the twelve books we read and then 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.969
 we can note that we are entitled to a purchase 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.229
 for example on taste of 12 pounds 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.219
 fin a buy but you do not have 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.109
 want to buy 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.780
 know that you can continue reading 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.470
 12 other books and you are not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.970
 forced 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.979
 to buy right away the book you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.600
 can accumulate multiple purchases per 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.610
 example I can read 24 books before 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 to buy 2 is really like 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.310
 feel it must not feel obliged 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.930
 to buy because we have the right 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.220
 to buy you really have to buy when 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.810
 it makes us happy and not by 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.430
 obligation for the challenge 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.200
 however, I would have to say that seen 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.150
 that I chained 2 pretty challenge 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.710
 difficult where we do not really have the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.350
 right to buy separately in certain 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.810
 conditions and exception I actually 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.360
 decided to give me a gift two months to 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.730
 I congratulate myself to please me because 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.470
 that I chained initial 0 am with this one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.880
 so I want to please myself while 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.560
 simply and actually I want to offer myself 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.030
 a box is the box Harry Potter 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.070
 which contains the cost of the che through 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 age the fantastic animals and the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.980
 tales of beedle the bard and that's right 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.780
 that I can not afford this box to 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.520
 cause of the challenge so I'm going to 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.650
 offer it on September 1st I order it 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.300
 ray simply and that's my little 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.050
 gift to congratulate me for having succeeded 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.520
 the challenge 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.959
 this is maybe next year I 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.060
 I will rest a new gift box 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.100
 who is now I was talking to you about 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 some purchase exceptions so these are 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.130
 books that I have the right to buy 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.750
 but who will not count in the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.190
 challenge simply there is 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.170
 three there is one that is a little 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.820
 different from last year so already 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.269
 first exception of these are the books 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.920
 school 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.540
 if I was going to be a school book that would not 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.459
 do not count for the challenge I'm not going 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.660
 not cracking in challenge for my books 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.220
 school because I think I'm going 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 have a lot to buy in September 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.230
 and october 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.760
 so I will not crack my 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.709
 challenge for my school books 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.900
 second exception these are of course the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.730
 choice books I subscribe to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 French shooting for a few years and 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.000
 I have to buy a book every three 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.010
 month but do not worry it's 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.690
 that a book every three months I do not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.430
 I'm not going to crack my underwear to choose 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.320
 it will be a book every three months 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.640
 it's pretty reasonable even very 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.840
 reasonable all right I have no choice 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.610
 I had to buy all three 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.030
 month france recreation the strength is not 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.590
 my fault 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.330
 a third exception that is 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.980
 different from the other years we did not 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.780
 never put this exception with audrey 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.370
 but I really wanted to talk to you about it 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.840
 because the problem is that we have 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.880
 observed during our challengers to 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.840
 purchases that poses problems during 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.010
 book fairs 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.870
 so I decided to make an exception 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.220
 for book fairs that means 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.170
 that for example a book fair game 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 even four authors I have the right to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.549
 give me four books a book for 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.000
 each author usually after I 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.130
 choose 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.079
 paperback because I do the most 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.430
 economic possible but for example if 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.329
 I see an illustrator I would 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.609
 offer an album 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.530
 finally I really want to be able to enjoy 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.060
 trade shows despite my challenge 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
 know that I do not do a lot of 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.260
 I will go to montreuil and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.850
 paris maybe to his death is to see 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.440
 but I really want to put the rooms 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.760
 principal but exception because I 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 finds it very frustrating to 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.990
 be able to buy at the voice book show 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.030
 for me it's still a place where 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.040
 I have to take advantage of the moment because 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.600
 I'm lucky to be able to go to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.310
 many salons so you really have to 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.690
 that I take advantage of the present moment I 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.620
 told you about my exceptions 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.630
 now I'm going to talk to you about my 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.220
 restrictions actually with the 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.110
 challenge in my opinion purchase it allowed me 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.080
 to see that I had not received anyway 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.000
 badly from sp gifts partnerships etc 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.620
 so I decided to restrict the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.690
 two things to restrict the gifts 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.850
 it's going to be a bit difficult because at 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.130
 share my family I can not really 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.540
 restricts bookish gifts that I 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.610
 get because I'm not responsible 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.050
 gifts that I can receive but I 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.090
 will make my parents understand and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.290
 my sister that they have to stop 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.570
 to buy books because I have 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.040
 already quite a lot to read but I think they 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.080
 are common they've seen a little state 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.280
 did not hurt me any way and the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 second restriction is in relation 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.270
 to the partnership at the press service as 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.380
 you know the chain collaboratively 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.530
 with publishing houses 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.080
 so I decided to interrupt some 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.390
 our commitments I have to restrict 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.130
 others and I decided to receive that 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.470
 some partnerships of houses 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.360
 of editing and teeth selected that 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.280
 certain amount because I can not 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.690
 read everything and the aspects it does not do 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.640
 lowering masts blades so I decided 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.960
 to be reasonable I also wanted you 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.700
 prevent that for this challenge with 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.290
 audrey we decided not to do any 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.790
 group on facebook for the simple and 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.260
 good reason we found that with the 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.880
 challenge is a nonsense purchase 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.830
 the facebook group did not really 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.460
 great utility so we decided to 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.410
 do not do it
