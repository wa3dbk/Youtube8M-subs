 jean-christophe thank you for receiving us in your manufacturer 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.090
 kitchen is remade fully ultramodern 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.570
 exactly has just finished the work of the farm to the work we have 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.290
 all redone 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.009
 with flows to pretty gift to the canourgue and with 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.699
 really a little bit of material that can high tech is in quotation marks 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.999
 so why 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.029
 of this number of manufactures 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.140
 these are the old tobacco factories of la dolce vita 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 e elected about a hundred years ago from tobacco 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 between the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.300
 but the winger the tobacco the blond the tobacco bahrein have a few cigarettes 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 it was rare 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.609
 note that the activity has acc in 1994 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.550
 so the few years of reconversion 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.999
 the authorities 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.420
 in 1989 decorate even the best 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 altogether it's even more than now 89 that so participating in 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.140
 a little bit rid of 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.090
 the bodies of the two restaurants 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.229
 what do you propose today 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.079
 so we will start with a carpaccio of his deeds 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.540
 the lawsuit can just cut his films in flood 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.770
 a little bit of olive oil 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.690
 some chips of parmesan and evian world of parma 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.799
 of course 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.659
 call a little wink to Italy 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.850
 so that's what was a little demonstration of old cleaning this 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.500
 that have been read 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.350
 in the kitchen for the youngest ones what are the precautions to take but 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.240
 this is a really very nice evening so the sector 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.060
 I know it's very simple you have to see it just needs the op 'on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.280
 to say not even the past to the water just indeed would have told afp lamothe a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.670
 little bit of land of a muse that stays a little bit at the foot of 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.619
 foot of the cff 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.560
 quite simply 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.930
 then maybe a little trickle of water in case they have 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.470
 a little bit of spending with his peers at wana limit to face the keeper 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.050
 but this is simply wrong alas the May 7 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.100
 and pretty it is beautiful or maybe a little trickle of water to go a little 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.429
 little behind calving small pieces of the bus that remain 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.859
 a little cool and what are the essential ingredients for the 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.190
 to succeed this carpaccio of sète 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.700
 so we have to help pretty is good despite a white that's 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 Very important 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 then a little bit of Parmesan cheese% of the parma ham 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.700
 since the Libyans on it can this time simply 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 so to all simply andré allard type the the all start of the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.519
 set the book for our recipe so you see your cp novel very very pretty 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.099
 white tobias a magnificat I am so coupet challenge of thin slats the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.509
 as soon as possible 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:24.009
 in a sense without really broken to get to see we're going to say a pretty 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.159
 carpaccio to his ends radeon 5000 proved it to be the quality the capa all a 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.019
 little bit finesse whatsoever in the beef in the bag in all that we 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.189
 can do so the carpaccio really has to be for its own purposes 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.889
 have done a little bit as you want but what is needed is a little bit 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.279
 fear we're going to say do not over-tighten the wish to bash do it like that 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 delicately nice little more to the slat team 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:51.179
 internet we are at a nice e a nice September members finally francs 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:56.040
 plate that is nice then so we seasoned with a little bit of 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.019
 from these 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.599
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.569
 a little mill tour 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.629
 the famous tower of the mill 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.810
 oula and also after fleeing both cities 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.079
 important 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.409
 two qualities of high quality our first will weigh cold beaupuy de 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.420
 rather grassy life that will be it will be better so now with them a few 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.069
 simply parmesan cheese shavings 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.489
 that's it that's all it's pretty it's beautiful we position ourselves like that 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.230
 among them 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.249
 of three as you want or what 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.869
 no bosses go parmesan the pana not salty enough sas anyway 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:30.290
 end 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.040
 so just 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 three small pieces like that and we wait a few few 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.999
 but especially the second of parma ham just to ask himself like that 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.999
 quite simply 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.009
 and the carpaccio is over we did not start the stopwatch but we can 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.189
 to say that it took 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.590
 only a few minutes so that's a very easy recipe that you can even 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.739
 prepared practically the most fair sale 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.510
 luis delis puts it at the last moment and those who are really in love can 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.700
 very well finished with a little bit of balsamic vinegar we just 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.590
 a little bit for the decor like that for the color for the color 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.389
 just here 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.299
 the famous carpaccio of c 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.509
 ford motor and parma ham 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.079

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.799
 the law somehow a greedy law very nice 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.799
 except for France it was very very fun it was my cooking 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.360
 so take a little bit of parmesan 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.240
 a little bit of 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.810
