00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.160
 ram贸n mifflin manuel barreto was a draw 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.160
 at the end in cusco 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.660
 until the images this first time 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.119
 first time with or slightly 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.220
 it seems to me that science was not better had 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 some irrigation situations like this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.419
 of castle a good triangulation what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 that they were finally able to find the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.600
 difference in a free throw well 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 executed from strap they find and 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.720
 leaving midway without power 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.650
 connect the ball after he had this 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.350
 also of cardoso 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.110
 he responds well I think that manuel 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.710
 crystal I seek to be dosed at the first 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.380
 time I do not say anything if I stay did two 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.980
 lines of four and stayed behind it 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.870
 is left behind as trying to save a 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 little air does not exist 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.400
 I have executed the ball stopped instantly 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.050
 timely there 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.640
 although the first one is not 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.020
 is the goal that gives the advantage to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.050
 scienceno in the university for a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 ball that stays around that defines well 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 santiago acasiete already for the seconds 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.050
 45 minutes 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 we continue reviewing images of the first 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.229
 Something of a calcaterra crystal time not with 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.500
 everything in this game I do not consider it 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.140
 daniela meta carlos lobat贸n like this when 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.240
 I had it in the possibility of playing 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.009
 was lobat贸n on the court put to 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.759
 sheput in the second time leguizam贸n 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.020
 it got better as it installs against 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.360
 we forget the recognized name that 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.850
 especially in the second time he continued 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.259
 being generous with the deployment not 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.679
 knowing the circumstances of where 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.599
 played and interns has a prize to it I 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.159
 I told you this sport in crystal that 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.929
 about the end he could even give it the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.950
 I had forgotten about that first 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.929
 played the second time also of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.289
 scienceno good to the combination of 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.479
 cardoso with gary strap that could also 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.679
 be can even increase the difference 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.810
 science in another has been history 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.849
 the truth ends up doing just the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.380
 young and such it spreads safer 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.310
 when there is a reference on the court 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.880
 it seems that they raised their football when 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.880
 when I entered the chubut
