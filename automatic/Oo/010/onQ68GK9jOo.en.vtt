00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.810
 hello everyone north with you and you look 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.290
 domain test today on the test with us 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:39.370
 new new range rover startech from 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.370
 author daimon in the back of 2014 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.300
 model is more than quality 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.610
 the initial number of polygons is about 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.790
 five million as I said earlier 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.100
 The model was taken from a paid site and in 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.829
 our game, you, too, on it just like that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.549
 you skate offline for free do not download 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.909
 and you wo n't find it on the site either 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:05.420
 all questions about the cost of the model about her 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.640
 shopping and similar of a similar kind 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.000
 inquiries should be addressed to the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.520
 man named richard link to his 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.810
 VKontakte page is in the description under 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.479
 this video 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.869
 going back to the very same model that well 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.869
 can say 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.720
 probably due to the fact that she paid it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.920
 made naturally on more than high 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.740
 level and no bugs I'm honest here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.130
 saying did not find any how about the cabin in any way 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.320
 on the external model also pleased me 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.560
 the amount of extras possible for 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.030
 additions namely this tinted rear 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.860
 hemispheres bright wheels bright roof 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.740
 still there is something like optics 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.710
 some x is generally more than worthy 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.240
 set and apparently due to the fact that the mod 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.350
 paid precisely this factor influenced 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.330
 such a number of extras 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 and level of overall performance 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.480
 it is also very difficult to find fault with the salon 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.390
 and I make no complaints with my 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.670
 hand in his direction can't all 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.560
 done very high quality and very 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.680
 beautifully the only thing at the moment 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.060
 There were no recordings of this video. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.710
 Exter for salon there is no there 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.990
 different colors nothing 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.160
 there was no such thing the authors said that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.440
 maybe in the near future something will be 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.060
 something will be added in the form of extras 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.330
 I liked the dashboard 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.070
 she looks very beautiful there 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.560
 indication of the gear that is 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.030
 actually already a long time ago 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.530
 indication of the parking brake 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.530
 light and high beam 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:06.200
 In general, the salon is more than successful in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.920
 camera driver plan 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.580
 it is comfortable enough to accommodate 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080
 you can accommodate with 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.750
 standard tools 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.320
 adjustments ie keys on us 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.070
 go and do not need any cameras tenor and her 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.980
 was run commands on the command line 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.340
 no just take tune when 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.700
 help us for yes and with the help of a mouse that 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.690
 concerns the behavior of the car on the road 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.420
 overclocking quite vigorous but still with 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.370
 some 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.820
 slowing down probably for such 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.540
 cars is normal for her weight for her 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:52.580
 sizes I got something about 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.560
 six and a half 6 6 5 6 7 seconds before 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.010
 100 in general, fashion physics is not inferior 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.780
 the general level of this very fashion 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.820
 there are roll and they are adequate and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.690
 the machines don't seem oaky yet 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.710
 she is not very fast that is at speed 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.780
 during abrupt changes the machine will 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:19.330
 well- controlled brakes too 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.300
 quite good and most importantly 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.400
 when braking the car when not very 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.360
 hard braking machine almost not 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.170
 heels 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.300
 and the border is exactly proportional 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.790
 pressing on the brake pedal 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.460
 that is, the more you click the more 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.970
 before the presses 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.970
 also mod has its own sound 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:59.870
 pretty good overall mod 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.200
 I liked the visible such obvious 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.510
 I did not find the only minuses in it 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.910
 that you need to get used just a little bit to 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.190
 manageability in terms of directly 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.310
 maneuverability because the car is big 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.500
 the wheels are far away then 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.810
 there is a big wheelbase and some 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.350
 places there is no capacity that wanted 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.460
 would see but this again for sizes 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:35.360
 car is quite normal on the body 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.340
 I have no complaints about the cabin 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.380
 I have already said that I personally would like to 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.040
 see more extras in terms of color that is 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.680
 not only here are the red inserts on 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.840
 front console and seat but still 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.200
 anything 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.400
 any beige inserts 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:02.140
 Well, in general, you can not think so hard 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:06.250
 Well, in general, 10 out of 10 I will put 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:10.180
 peace of mind mod is really very 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.480
 good and as i said bugs in it i 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.690
 not found but for all questions about the cost 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.270
 payment methods please contact 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.640
 Richard has a link to his page in 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.950
 video description 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.850
 I have nothing to do with sales 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.940
 so once again a private message to me 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.360
 but you can not write because I'm all you 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.830
 Equally just throw off a link to Richard 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.880
 so if there are any questions 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.560
 Immediately write him a link in the description but 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.980
 it was at home in test 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.210
 thank you all for watching everyone thanks 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.210
 subscribe everyone bye
