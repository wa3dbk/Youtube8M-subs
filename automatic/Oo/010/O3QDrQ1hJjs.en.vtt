00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:11.450
 Hi there is a well-known store Gikoinko no Kijima This time the Kansai-based men are already human 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.410
 I would like to talk about things 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:21.930
 It is a so-called man who is very good condition 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 That very nice man is already that married person 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:36.120
 Well, those women who have been engaged in marriage are from the beginning . 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:40.680
 Saying it is from the beginning but I'm such tend to seeking a man that is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.920
 There are very few men in the finished form 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.379
 Completion to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:53.379
 Some people are rare, but at first men are 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:58.620
 Well now it is the beginning even if it is said that the finished form is a man 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:03.300
 Speaking of delicious shops, I only know chain stores 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:10.890
 I do not have a car anymore, so when I go somewhere far that one 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.610
 You rent a car and you don't go and you do n't have a good sense of clothes or you 're not very good at talking 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.690
 is not it 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 It is good that the conversation does not bounce Escort 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.420
 Men who can not escort women 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 It is- 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.680
 of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:31.409
 After all, so are doctors and jewelry 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:37.829
 You can't shine without polishing 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 Even those men who can not do this from the beginning are cut off to say no 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.940
 Not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.610
 Even among those men, it is always true that those who shine if polished 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.930
 You are welcome 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 Though I'm a thing of whether I should polish How so 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:02.280
 When you are dating it is you 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.220
 It is a sense of clothes, I will look for things like these escorts and shops 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 Ne 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.069
 If you do something like this, it will disappear 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.970
 You know the story is solid which also I 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:21.720
 It's about getting along and doing each other 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:25.140
 If there is a story you will not become a poor and whether the gas vapor or was cozy opponent even in the silence 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.730
 If you are not good at talking 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.170
 The reason why you don't bounce is gone 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.110
 Masu Tei 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 I don't have a car, so I think it's a key from now on 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.230
 For example, the fuel economy is already very bad 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:48.430
 He does not have a car now than a man who has a sports car 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.160
 After marriage you decided to car with you 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.590
 Oko Samagade 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 Thinking about the time when it came and buying a family car or thinking together 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.940
 Than you can 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.990
 Just because I don't have a car 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:09.320
 I can't go anywhere I'm not being told 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.240
 If you have been married, everyone with the goal of getting married, so dating period 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.820
 It is very short 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:22.640
 Such a marriage refuse to decide in two people in the I think good if it is buy a car 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.980
 It is very attractive that men who can do all these things 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.250
 Ah 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:36.090
 There is a yearly income and some appearances, but such a content is very nice men 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.230
 This is from the beginning, and it's not only these people, but it's polished up in the past 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.370
 If it is glowing 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:48.269
 It will be that man that has been shining Well 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:53.060
 Some women I is will be able to close an Permian man in his ideal in such of 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.060
 It's a perfect person from the beginning 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.430
 It is not 1 but after all there is nothing out there 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:19.730
 I have no meeting or something, I can not decide myself 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:24.830
 Those who are likely to be adults or those are gradually becoming your ideal of your choice 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:30.340
 It is by all means because it is a man that can go close to the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:36.520
 It's not because I can't do something like that and I'm not giving it up immediately 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:39.550
 Where can I change ? If you support me and say it, be sure that the other man is better 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:46.570
 It will be by all means 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:50.330
 From the beginning with the men and two together not in the perfect form 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:57.280
 To be able to approach my own ideal man 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.280
 I think it would be best to walk with two nice people Thank you very much
