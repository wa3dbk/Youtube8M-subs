that works in a second so leave

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.190 
that works in a second so leave
everything<00:00:52.790> blunt<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.300> disperse<00:00:53.570> ok<00:00:53.900> so<00:00:53.960> all

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
so it's style equals and then the open

you we can now see it's actually

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860 
you we can now see it's actually
shortened<00:03:16.730> whereas<00:03:16.940> before<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.360> all<00:03:17.569> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
way to the edge now it's gotten to 700

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.290 
way to the edge now it's gotten to 700
pixels<00:03:19.880> which<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> lot<00:03:20.599> shorter<00:03:22.120> going<00:03:23.120> back

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
pixels which is a lot shorter going back

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.660 
pixels which is a lot shorter going back
into<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.720> cold<00:03:24.230> space<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.400> height<00:03:28.239> sorry<00:03:29.239> hei

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
into the cold space and height sorry hei

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.690 
into the cold space and height sorry hei
ght<00:03:31.670> I'm<00:03:32.030> going<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.260> give<00:03:33.830> this<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:34.400> height<00:03:34.670> of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
ght I'm going to give this a height of

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.400 
ght I'm going to give this a height of
say<00:03:35.030> 500<00:03:35.569> pixels<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.480> press<00:03:38.480> give<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
say 500 pixels and press give it a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.430 
say 500 pixels and press give it a
semicolon<00:03:39.860> onion<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.989> it's<00:03:42.140> become

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
semicolon onion and so it's become

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.250 
semicolon onion and so it's become
longer<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.360> seriously<00:03:44.750> be<00:03:44.900> actually

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
longer so we can seriously be actually

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.970 
longer so we can seriously be actually
adding<00:03:45.530> specific<00:03:45.739> rules<00:03:46.340> for<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:46.970> div<00:03:47.330> tag

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
specifically so we've been a color

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.150 
specifically so we've been a color
height<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.140> now<00:03:54.680> something<00:03:55.010> also

center<00:04:40.980> stage<00:04:41.980> one<00:04:42.250> percent<00:04:42.669> it's<00:04:43.180> always

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
center stage one percent it's always

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.960 
center stage one percent it's always
going<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.290> center<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.980> page<00:04:45.220> me

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
going to be in the center of the page me

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.700 
going to be in the center of the page me
if<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.180> collapse<00:04:46.600> closing<00:04:47.080> I'll<00:04:47.260> narrow<00:04:47.530> it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
if I collapse closing I'll narrow it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.000 
if I collapse closing I'll narrow it
down<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:49.180> will<00:04:49.360> always<00:04:49.630> be<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.470> center<00:04:50.860> of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
down it will always be in the center of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.650 
down it will always be in the center of
the<00:04:51.130> pit<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.639> think<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.060> quite<00:04:52.630> a

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
the pit so that I think is a quite a

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.770 
the pit so that I think is a quite a
cool<00:04:52.960> thing<00:04:53.139> so<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.669> that's<00:04:54.880> something<00:04:55.060> really

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
cool thing so so that's something really

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.390 
cool thing so so that's something really

to add in lifestyles and the way I do it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.880 
to add in lifestyles and the way I do it
is<00:05:03.640> within<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.060> first<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:05.080> opening<00:05:05.500> tag<00:05:05.710> of

the<00:05:06.040> div<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:07.060> could<00:05:07.270> be<00:05:07.360> done<00:05:07.480> for

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
the div and it could be done for

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.240 
the div and it could be done for
pictures<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.169> could<00:05:08.290> be<00:05:08.350> done<00:05:08.440> for<00:05:08.500> links<00:05:09.210> ECT

pictures it could be done for links ECT

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.680 
pictures it could be done for links ECT
but<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.460> way<00:05:12.550> I've<00:05:12.640> done<00:05:12.820> this<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.450> press

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
but the way I've done this is of press

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.620 
but the way I've done this is of press
style<00:05:14.140> equals<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.100> then<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.850> open<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:18.630> speech

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
style equals and then it open the speech

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.450 
style equals and then it open the speech
marks<00:05:19.990> that's<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.380> opening<00:05:20.740> one<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.250> is

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
marks that's the opening one and that is

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.190 
marks that's the opening one and that is
the<00:05:21.640> closing<00:05:21.970> one<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.540> within<00:05:22.690> they've<00:05:22.960> got

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
the closing one and within they've got

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.430 
the closing one and within they've got
all<00:05:23.320> my<00:05:23.500> Styles<00:05:23.860> all<00:05:24.340> my<00:05:24.580> rules<00:05:25.440> the

all my Styles all my rules the

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.250 
all my Styles all my rules the
background<00:05:26.890> rule<00:05:27.130> did<00:05:27.790> with<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.570> height<00:05:28.930> and

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
background rule did with the height and

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.070 
background rule did with the height and
the<00:05:29.320> margin<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:31.000> this<00:05:31.150> is<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.330> just<00:05:31.900> going<00:05:32.020> to

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
the margin so this is a just going to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.590 
the margin so this is a just going to
show<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.229> guys<00:05:32.350> in<00:05:32.800> another<00:05:32.950> style<00:05:33.790> i<00:05:33.970> created

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
show you guys in another style i created

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.570 
show you guys in another style i created
we<00:05:35.410> created<00:05:35.860> together<00:05:35.950> in<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.310> previous

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
we created together in a previous

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.890 
we created together in a previous
tutorial<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:37.419> going<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.660> double<00:05:37.780> click

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
tutorial so just going to double click

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.220 
tutorial so just going to double click
so<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:38.590> can<00:05:38.740> see<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.250> syntax<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.300> for

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
so you can see the syntax is for

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.010 
so you can see the syntax is for
the<00:05:42.800> actual<00:05:43.370> style<00:05:43.820> rules<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:44.330> similar<00:05:44.810> so

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
the actual style rules are similar so

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.890 
the actual style rules are similar so
where<00:05:45.380> we've<00:05:45.740> got<00:05:45.980> height<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.580> crawl<00:05:47.450> on<00:05:47.630> and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
where we've got height and crawl on and

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.310 
where we've got height and crawl on and
then<00:05:48.050> it's<00:05:48.260> 200<00:05:48.950> pixels<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.610> then<00:05:49.790> it's<00:05:49.970> a

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
then it's 200 pixels and then it's a

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.690 
then it's 200 pixels and then it's a
semicolon<00:05:51.400> similarly<00:05:52.930> its<00:05:53.930> height<00:05:54.500> call<00:05:55.490> on

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
semicolon similarly its height call on

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.290 
semicolon similarly its height call on
500<00:05:56.300> cells<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:57.320> colon<00:05:58.130> so<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:58.850> can<00:05:59.030> see<00:05:59.210> the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
500 cells and colon so you can see the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.120 
500 cells and colon so you can see the
similarities<00:05:59.960> I've<00:06:00.500> hope<00:06:00.650> you've<00:06:01.010> enjoyed

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
similarities I've hope you've enjoyed

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.980 
similarities I've hope you've enjoyed
