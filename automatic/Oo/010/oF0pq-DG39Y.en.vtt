00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello beautiful all the guys here we are 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.870
 today on the occasion of the release of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.349
 new iphone 5 in america 12 september 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.980
 while the wait will end here in Italy 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.410
 5 October 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 here is the official video that starts 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 showing us the two white colors 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 black usual colors a little the usual 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 design even if here we see the video that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.270
 he says to the new design then a new one 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 design 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.930
 I wouldn't completely say anyway 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 so many news at screen level a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 level of magnitude at the level of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 we see 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.859
 here is weight thickness indeed 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 despite its size not many 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.090
 new components is lighter than the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 previous and offers features 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.390
 completely new 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 we say the most satisfying like 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 example the 1 gb ram and the camera 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 hd and here we see a novelty here 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 absolute the usb 3.0 that allows to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 reduce transfer times 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.750
 data and even say 50 per 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.430
 one hundred therefore to halve them and as to the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.949
 we usually see a single one says 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.000
 plug for reloading to transfer 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.430
 data and anything else even the sim 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 card as you see the sim card hand that is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 great almost half of the usual you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 in charge we are used to seeing 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.930
 so today this is an exclusive 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.369
 iphone 5 this is something almost from 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.170
 let's say from spy movies the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.900
 fingerprint recognition 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 which acts as a release let's say with 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 password and with a technological thing of the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
 all innovative that it really is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 really nice as an idea is also like 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 new solution new software ones 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.770
 which are the possibilities of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 always better customizations either 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.600
 as for the usefulness of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.479
 screen the themes whatever else is a bit of everything 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 what also concerns bees 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.890
 software inside your iphone 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 lots of new apps also to say 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 for the work 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.580
 well let's say that this time the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.320
 apple does not disappoint 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.400
 the wait ended up in america like I said 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.229
 here in Italy the exit is October 5th 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.990
 we hope this time goes into 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.400
 hurry and this is solar more and more 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.020
