00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
months yeah and so I suppose if he has

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
months yeah and so I suppose if he has
something<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.280> think

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
something like that and you know I think

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
something like that and you know I think
of<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.659> Punk<00:01:33.810> vs<00:01:34.140> Austin<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> probably<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
of I think Punk vs Austin a probably is

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
of I think Punk vs Austin a probably is
the<00:01:34.979> B<00:01:35.909> match<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.900> would<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the B match I think he would have to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
the B match I think he would have to
come<00:01:37.380> back<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.590> especially<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.159> I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
come back for especially now with I

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
come back for especially now with I
suppose<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> similarities<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.170> quite

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
suppose the similarities I don't quite

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.210 
suppose the similarities I don't quite
know<00:01:40.350> how<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.740> play<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
know how that we play with the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.179 
know how that we play with the
similarities<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.000> how<00:01:42.720> Austin<00:01:43.229> left<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
similarities with how Austin left and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.590 
similarities with how Austin left and
kind<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.549> took<00:01:44.790> his<00:01:44.939> ball<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.299> went<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
kind of took his ball and went with it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.139 
kind of took his ball and went with it
and<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.869> how<00:01:46.079> Punk's<00:01:46.619> done<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> same<00:01:46.979> thing

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
and now how Punk's done the same thing

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.069 
and now how Punk's done the same thing
potentially<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.270> could<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.689> something<00:01:48.840> kind

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
potentially this could be something kind

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
potentially this could be something kind
of<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.439> perhaps<00:01:50.189> um<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
of in that perhaps um but you know I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
of in that perhaps um but you know I
mean<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> would<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> shame<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:54.990> you've<00:01:55.770> got

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
mean it would be a shame but you've got

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.590 
mean it would be a shame but you've got
to<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> fan<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.360> point<00:01:57.509> you've

back to the ring 10 minutes remaining
one<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.620> them<00:02:23.739> was<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.069> he<00:02:24.840> basically<00:02:25.840> he

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
one of them was that he basically he

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780 
one of them was that he basically he
feels<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.650> would<00:02:26.769> take<00:02:26.980> about<00:02:27.190> three

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
feels that it would take about three

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.140 
feels that it would take about three
months<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.239> really<00:02:29.200> intense<00:02:29.530> training<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:31.000> get

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
months of really intense training to get

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.729 
months of really intense training to get
up<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> point<00:02:31.840> where<00:02:31.989> he<00:02:32.260> could<00:02:32.500> actually

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
up to a point where he could actually

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.220 
up to a point where he could actually
work<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.640> match<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> decent<00:02:34.420> standard<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.079> mean

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
work a match to a decent standard I mean

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.660

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
used to be able to when Steve Austin's a

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.210 
used to be able to when Steve Austin's a
guy<00:02:43.329> who's<00:02:43.569> very<00:02:43.780> proud<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.200> his<00:02:44.470> body<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.040> work

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.080 
and by proud of his in-ring quality and
I<00:02:47.799> don't<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.370> he'd<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.609> too<00:02:48.760> happy<00:02:48.790> if

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
I don't think that he'd be too happy if

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.059 
I don't think that he'd be too happy if
he<00:02:49.209> wasn't<00:02:49.510> able<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.959> produce<00:02:50.410> something<00:02:50.829> that

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
he wasn't able to produce something that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.699 
he wasn't able to produce something that
was<00:02:51.160> worth<00:02:51.310> watching<00:02:51.599> yeah<00:02:52.599> another<00:02:53.319> reason

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
was worth watching yeah another reason

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.410 
was worth watching yeah another reason
he<00:02:53.739> said<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.849> basically<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
he said that was that basically the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.490 
he said that was that basically the
adrenaline<00:02:55.870> rush<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.109> you<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.440> from

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
adrenaline rush that you get from

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.589 
adrenaline rush that you get from
wrestling<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.220> very<00:02:57.430> difficult<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.819> come<00:02:58.120> down

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
wrestling is very difficult to come down

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.630 
wrestling is very difficult to come down
from<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.890> he<00:03:00.310> took<00:03:00.489> him

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640

from and if you and he took him
apparently<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:01.120> couple<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.420> years<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.959> get

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
apparently a couple of years just to get

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.080 
apparently a couple of years just to get
over<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.769> doing<00:03:03.159> that<00:03:03.190> anymore<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.819> if<00:03:03.879> he<00:03:03.970> was

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
over not doing that anymore so if he was

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.550 
over not doing that anymore so if he was
to<00:03:04.180> come<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.810> would<00:03:04.900> he'd<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.319> to<00:03:05.379> go

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
to come back it would he'd have to go

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.750 
to come back it would he'd have to go
through<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:05.799> all<00:03:05.980> over<00:03:06.010> again<00:03:06.220> like<00:03:06.519> cold

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
through that all over again like cold

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.899 
through that all over again like cold
turkey<00:03:07.000> basically<00:03:07.629> from<00:03:07.870> wrestling<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.220> they

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
turkey basically from wrestling so they

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:10.920 
turkey basically from wrestling so they
just<00:03:10.120> seemed<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> number<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.810> reasons

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
just seemed to be a number of reasons
