00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 many gardeners ask the question what 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 prune the best trees in the spring we 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 specially invited to us at the sites 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.000
 Vladimir is bewitched which is not with empty 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.830
 hands came hello a lot 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 all the interesting not all hands 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 fit let's get to work 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 find out here in own here look at you 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 Vitalik 8 and we cut off the branches so as not to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 froze left here such hemp but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 This can not be done in any way 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 there will be a hollow here than you suggest 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 this cut off here fits first 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 turn and plane pruner he cuts 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.610
 close to the trunk without leaving stump 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 This machine is suitable for us here. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 pruner suitable for this purpose this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.140
 pruner too suitable but I look at him 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.600
 small diameter and twigs well if 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 something very large then some 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.649
 hacksaw or like my rechargeable 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.940
 saw chic things lila any expose 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.980
 professional pruner too 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 planar what is different planar 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.570
 that is, it overlaps the cutting 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.270
 tool main completely only 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 plane pruner will not be yes from 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.570
 stage to no longer be with us 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.619
 experimented see here 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.689
 here we have a pruner 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.900
 professional will require serious 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.900
 effort 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.930
 here it is an even cut . he celebrated. we 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.600
 right hp but hard because with more 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.299
 that's the diameter for such a pruner 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.330
 Of course a little too big 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.290
 learning cuts very tight if necessary 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.439
 something higher then uses plot pruner 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.259
 at 6 here is also a principle in to the basics 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.439
 pruner used plus 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.270
 turning 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.780
 head turned fixed and it means 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780
 produce pruning 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.369
 very handy tool who does not 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.380
 enough effort to work like this 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 large shears can be used 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.189
 battery pruner 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.619
 it is slightly more expensive than conventional pruners but 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.229
 This battery gives you the opportunity 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.289
 make 500 cuts wood thickness 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.030
 about 10 millimeters is not enough 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.489
 I really liked this tool 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 very interesting here I press a button and 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.810
 he starts work it is rechargeable 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.090
 saw that allows you to cut trees 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 up to 6 centimeters a day 30 branch this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.560
 is gaining exactly in this thread brands 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.019
 I want it myself so naturally means 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630
 hold the tool here there is such 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.299
 the recess which we set on the branch 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.150
 you first turn on the fuse and 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:35.700
 turn on trigger it can 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.739
 hand I forgive 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.760
 very scraping serve to your 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.150
 the file was tight on the branch and did not give 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.849
 strong vibration that's principle not 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 hacksaw basically a woman with such here 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.230
 thick branch can handle 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.750
 here again, look, we cut them 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.030
 and we got such rims 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.750
 but that is not desirable to leave both 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.870
 fight it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.390
 This limiter is removed and we 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.299
 get a working pilot you are watching here 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.580
 when we cut a branch is desirable also 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.580
 leave her without a penny turn on 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 here pay attention turned out 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.819
 quite a cut in principle 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.280
 does not even require knife treatment Vladimir 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.890
 here on this thread you can see that it is very sharp 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.500
 angle therefore with growth fragile in any 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.640
 case ever 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 splitting happen this is what can 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.459
 here yourself baited whether chainsaw again 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.019
 there is a certain way of cutting 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.019
 such flowers 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.730
 yes means it turned out perfectly smooth 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.030
 that vladimir will help us still have 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.140
 trees without question well, try to give 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.140
 battery saw in action 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.129
 In principle, the battery is not bad at saw 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.860
 showed itself a good weight and enough 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.499
 fast no worse than a chainsaw and here on 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.689
 further pills for the bath 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.509
 in the spring after pruning always remains 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.430
 a lot of branches that need 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.639
 recycle as it is easiest 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.159
 make safe we ​​found a solution to this 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.439
 from special goats who understand 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.560
 they are easily stored when needed 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.080
 Yasina yes you installed them at the dacha 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.849
 plot the working part of a goat is very 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.629
 high so we all accumulated 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.610
 trash after pruning put here 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.529
 very uncomfortable 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.590
 this garbage store it takes very 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:12.529
 a lot of space it's uncomfortable to cut it bale 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.240
 with an ax so we are now putting everything 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:19.789
 here goats and try it all quickly 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.749
 quickly chop the branches completely 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:26.360
 different sizes and configurations stick out in 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:30.259
 all sides from another good branch 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.870
 tightly put so we scored a bunch 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.300
 brushwood and now that this horse does not 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.669
 ran it is necessary to fix it yes it 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.229
 change special planochka set on 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.659
 average kitty 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.589
 only the first quest collected by us 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.839
 stuff all 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.050
 but now we take a chainsaw and the case 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.050
 simple 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.479
 dogs 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.009
 already 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.069
 shafikov 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.150
 Ksyusha pay attention there with 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:11.139
 sand group what diameter is needed 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.139
 peace we are sawing 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.419
 no, I'm good 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.950
 she is 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.960
 tumbler dog 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.070
 very low is metal 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.070
 parts are therefore not afraid that I am for 1 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:38.810
 and here we just pay attention 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.810
 fixed in the middle she stayed 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:49.360
 taking off with a fox protagonist we grow 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:52.730
 hara spirina wood 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.360
 pointed going and about very easy 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.090
 cleaned up somewhere in the garage or 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.710
 some storage space they occupy 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.200
 a bit from on the dacha 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.170
 here are neatly cut and twigs 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.510
 and can be easily put into the stove to do 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.160
 kebab or just cook yourself dinner 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.160
 work with enthusiasm
