spot any enemies coming in across that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.420 
spot any enemies coming in across that
orbital<00:01:34.310> area<00:01:34.490> they're<00:01:38.200> not<00:01:39.200> going<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.740> wrist

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
orbital area they're not going to wrist

shot<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:40.909> teach<00:01:41.149> one<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:41.659> very

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
shot this teach one is it's very

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.620 
shot this teach one is it's very
unlikely<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.380> they're<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.680> hit<00:01:43.630> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
unlikely that they're going to hit and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.990 
unlikely that they're going to hit and
even<00:01:44.899> if<00:01:45.020> they<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.289> hit<00:01:46.039> probably<00:01:46.640> not<00:01:46.759> going

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
even if they do hit probably not going

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.880 
even if they do hit probably not going
to<00:01:47.090> penetrate<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.719> front<00:01:47.990> turret<00:01:48.439> armor<00:01:48.770> of

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.690 

so<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.070> speed<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.549> little

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
so just going to speed it up a little

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.830 
so just going to speed it up a little
until<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.479> get<00:01:55.750> into<00:01:56.409> some<00:01:57.280> action<00:01:58.090> it's

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
until we get into some action it's

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240 
until we get into some action it's
pretty<00:01:59.049> much<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.229> going<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.650> be<00:01:59.740> sitting<00:01:59.950> on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
pretty much just going to be sitting on

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.429 
pretty much just going to be sitting on
the<00:02:00.430> hill<00:02:00.610> spotting<00:02:01.090> out<00:02:01.240> who<00:02:01.509> they<00:02:01.869> can<00:02:02.170> and

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439

letting<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.009> battle<00:02:03.369> progress<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> little<00:02:03.850> bit

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
letting the battle progress a little bit

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.980 
letting the battle progress a little bit
and<00:02:04.960> then<00:02:05.860> deciding<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.759> move<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.570> right

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
and then deciding to move out right

and then deciding to move out right
about<00:02:08.140> now<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.770> one<00:02:08.920> thing<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.190> can

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
about now so that's one thing you can

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.680 
about now so that's one thing you can
deal<00:02:09.550> with<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.729> Chafee<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.539> more

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
deal with the Chafee is get more

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.110 
deal with the Chafee is get more
advanced<00:02:10.929> position<00:02:11.350> spot<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:11.950> then<00:02:12.489> let<00:02:12.760> your

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
advanced position spot and then let your

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.100 
advanced position spot and then let your
allies<00:02:13.600> tick<00:02:15.209> basically<00:02:16.209> take<00:02:16.450> over<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.870> take

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
allies tick basically take over you take

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.009 
allies tick basically take over you take
the<00:02:17.470> frontal<00:02:17.890> position<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.520> you're<00:02:19.480> now<00:02:19.720> in

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
the frontal position so you're now in

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.550 
the frontal position so you're now in
the<00:02:20.050> middle<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.920> back<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:22.560> advancing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the middle to the back of the advancing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
the middle to the back of the advancing
force<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.130> then<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:24.940> wait<00:02:25.120> out<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
force and then you can just wait out the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.030 
force and then you can just wait out the
battle<00:02:25.690> until<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.050> winds<00:02:26.410> down<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.620> bit<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
battle until it winds down a bit and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
battle until it winds down a bit and
then<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.610> use<00:02:27.819> your<00:02:29.010> superior<00:02:30.010> speed<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
then you can use your superior speed and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.059 
then you can use your superior speed and
maneuverability<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.319> zip<00:02:32.620> around<00:02:32.709> to

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
maneuverability to zip around to

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.559 
maneuverability to zip around to
different<00:02:33.220> areas<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> battlefield<00:02:34.360> and

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
different areas on the battlefield and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.250 
different areas on the battlefield and
either<00:02:35.290> spot<00:02:35.680> people<00:02:36.010> out<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:36.400> take<00:02:37.000> out

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
either spot people out or take out

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.840 
either spot people out or take out
weakened<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.530> damaged<00:02:39.459> opponents<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
weakened and damaged opponents so the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.729 
weakened and damaged opponents so the
spots<00:02:43.150> out<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.510> law<00:02:43.750> not<00:02:44.019> sure<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.380> he's<00:02:44.410> been

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
spots out this law not sure if he's been

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.410 
spots out this law not sure if he's been
spotted<00:02:44.950> himself<00:02:45.459> probably<00:02:48.060> takes<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> shot

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
spotted himself probably takes a shot

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.820 
spotted himself probably takes a shot
but<00:02:49.600> unfortunate<00:02:50.170> doesn't<00:02:50.380> penetrate<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
but unfortunate doesn't penetrate the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.680 
but unfortunate doesn't penetrate the
armor<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.190> yes<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.580> said<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.209> one

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
armor so yes like I said one of the one

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.300 
armor so yes like I said one of the one
of<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> key<00:02:53.080> tactic<00:02:53.440> until<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.860> Chafee<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
of the key tactic until the Chafee is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.880 
of the key tactic until the Chafee is
just<00:02:55.239> visited<00:02:55.930> play<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> waiting<00:02:56.319> game<00:02:56.500> and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
just visited play the waiting game and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.770 
just visited play the waiting game and
let<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.370> battle<00:02:58.000> progress<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.390> little<00:02:58.540> bit

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
let the battle progress a little bit

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.930 
let the battle progress a little bit
further<00:02:58.930> let<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.530> idiots<00:03:00.040> kill<00:03:00.579> each<00:03:00.790> other

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
further let the idiots kill each other

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.530 
further let the idiots kill each other
off<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.829> let<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.250> people<00:03:04.030> who<00:03:04.150> decide<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
off and let the people who decide to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.630 
off and let the people who decide to
rush<00:03:05.140> get<00:03:05.590> killed<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.430> wait

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
rush get killed and then you can wait

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.910 
rush get killed and then you can wait
until<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.600> enemy<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.019> worn<00:03:08.350> down<00:03:08.560> slightly

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
until the enemy is worn down slightly

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.680 
until the enemy is worn down slightly
and<00:03:09.070> then<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.609> relocate<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.329> different

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and then you can relocate the different

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.420 
and then you can relocate the different
areas<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.170> battlefield<00:03:11.560> where<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.190> are

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
areas on the battlefield where you are

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.030 
areas on the battlefield where you are
needed<00:03:13.060> which<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.930> pretty<00:03:14.380> much<00:03:14.500> exactly<00:03:14.739> what

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
needed which is pretty much exactly what

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
needed which is pretty much exactly what
he's<00:03:15.220> doing<00:03:15.250> here<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.359> to<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.630> moving

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
he's doing here just going to be moving

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.810 
he's doing here just going to be moving
to<00:03:17.440> probably<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.070> center<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.549> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
to probably the center of the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.240 
to probably the center of the
battlefield<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.690> far<00:03:19.959> south<00:03:20.260> pretty<00:03:21.010> much

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
battlefield as the far south pretty much

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.069 
battlefield as the far south pretty much
looks<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.640> it's<00:03:21.790> also<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.329> up<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.959> going

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
looks like it's also on up so just going

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.759 
looks like it's also on up so just going
to<00:03:23.170> speed<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.470> up<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.680> little<00:03:23.829> bit<00:03:25.500> until<00:03:26.500> we

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
to speed this up a little bit until we

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.229 
to speed this up a little bit until we
get<00:03:26.980> back<00:03:27.190> into<00:03:28.090> some<00:03:28.660> action<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.790> yes<00:03:30.940> as<00:03:31.120> you

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
get back into some action so yes as you

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.520 
get back into some action so yes as you
can<00:03:31.359> see<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.690> there's<00:03:31.810> pretty<00:03:32.109> much<00:03:32.170> nobody

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
can see there there's pretty much nobody

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.020 
can see there there's pretty much nobody
in<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.859> middle<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.400> going<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.579> be<00:03:33.670> taking

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
in the middle so just going to be taking

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.599 
in the middle so just going to be taking
a<00:03:34.120> spotting<00:03:35.049> role<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.799> center<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.430> map

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
a spotting role in the center of the map

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.000 
a spotting role in the center of the map
and<00:03:36.880> then<00:03:37.720> advancing<00:03:38.290> up<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.590> trying<00:03:38.799> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
and then advancing up and trying to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.830 
and then advancing up and trying to
flank<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.790> enemy<00:03:39.819> search<00:03:40.390> going<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.690> try<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
flank the enemy search going to try and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.470 
flank the enemy search going to try and
get<00:03:41.019> into<00:03:41.230> some<00:03:41.410> safe<00:03:41.829> cover<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:43.239> not

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
get into some safe cover so that is not

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.610 
get into some safe cover so that is not
visible<00:03:43.900> from<00:03:44.170> all<00:03:44.680> angles<00:03:44.950> at<00:03:45.760> least<00:03:46.620> spots

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
visible from all angles at least spots

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.559 
visible from all angles at least spots
out<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.069> t32<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:49.060> going<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.359> few

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
out the t32 so just going to have a few

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.090 
out the t32 so just going to have a few
shots<00:03:49.780> at<00:03:49.959> him<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:50.440> should<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.620> some<00:03:50.859> easy

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
shots at him so this should be some easy

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
shots at him so this should be some easy
damage<00:03:52.500> 140<00:03:53.500> got<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> critical<00:03:54.880> there<00:03:55.000> with

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
damage 140 got a critical there with

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.849 
damage 140 got a critical there with
more<00:03:55.269> damage<00:03:55.600> definitely<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> little<00:03:56.440> bit<00:03:56.680> down

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
more damage definitely a little bit down

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.840 
more damage definitely a little bit down
on<00:03:56.920> this<00:03:57.190> t32<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:59.290> we'll<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.950> weakened<00:04:00.549> him
