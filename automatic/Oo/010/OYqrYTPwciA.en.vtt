thing is going to come out all right
pull<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.000> copper<00:01:52.299> thing

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
pull this on out of the copper thing

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.219 
pull this on out of the copper thing
there<00:01:52.659> okay<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.429> here<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.090> polaris<00:01:55.479> 120

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
there okay so here is the polaris 120

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.330 
there okay so here is the polaris 120
you<00:01:56.920> can<00:01:57.100> see<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:58.090> has<00:01:58.350> lots<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.590> heat

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
you can see that it has lots of heat

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.990 
you can see that it has lots of heat
fins<00:02:00.610> all<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.600> way<00:02:01.750> down<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.439> also<00:02:02.799> has<00:02:03.250> copper

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
fins all the way down it also has copper

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
fins all the way down it also has copper
inner<00:02:04.420> tubing<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.770> has<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.310> cup<00:02:06.969> or<00:02:07.090> base

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
inner tubing and it has a cup or base

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.469 
inner tubing and it has a cup or base
surrounded<00:02:08.979> by<00:02:09.099> aluminum<00:02:09.610> now<00:02:10.119> what<00:02:10.360> this

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
surrounded by aluminum now what this

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.150 
surrounded by aluminum now what this
does<00:02:10.539> right<00:02:10.929> here<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.349> all<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.799> these<00:02:11.950> heat

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
does right here is all of these heat

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.640 
does right here is all of these heat
pipes<00:02:12.430> right<00:02:12.610> here<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.090> see<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:14.349> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
pipes right here that you see all the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.350 
pipes right here that you see all the
heat<00:02:14.799> from<00:02:14.950> your<00:02:15.040> CP<00:02:15.519> 0<00:02:15.549> gets<00:02:15.880> gathered<00:02:16.269> up

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
heat from your CP 0 gets gathered up

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.240 
heat from your CP 0 gets gathered up
here<00:02:16.660> goes<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.410> through<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.040> gets

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
here goes up through here and gets

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.280 
here goes up through here and gets
dissipated<00:02:18.760> into<00:02:19.090> these<00:02:19.360> fins<00:02:19.750> for

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
dissipated into these fins for

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.890 
dissipated into these fins for
additional<00:02:20.739> cooling<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> fan<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.690> fan

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
additional cooling you get a fan the fan

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 
additional cooling you get a fan the fan
is<00:02:23.079> mounted<00:02:23.410> onto<00:02:23.560> here<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.099> then<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.579> fat

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
is mounted onto here and then the fat

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.670 
is mounted onto here and then the fat
helps<00:02:25.120> keep<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> additional<00:02:25.930> cooling<00:02:26.170> down

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
helps keep the additional cooling down

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160 
helps keep the additional cooling down
so<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> unboxing<00:02:28.329> will<00:02:28.750> actually<00:02:29.019> go

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
so this is the unboxing will actually go

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.539 
so this is the unboxing will actually go
ahead<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.410> mount<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.829> thing<00:02:30.040> up<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:30.519> of

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
ahead and mount this thing up on one of

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.170 
ahead and mount this thing up on one of
our<00:02:30.790> new<00:02:31.180> Intel<00:02:31.660> p67<00:02:32.410> systems<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.700> we're<00:02:34.120> going

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
our new Intel p67 systems so we're going

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420 
our new Intel p67 systems so we're going
to<00:02:34.329> take<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.569> Polaris<00:02:34.900> 120<00:02:35.470> we'll<00:02:35.950> hook<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.280> up

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
to take the Polaris 120 we'll hook it up

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.710 
to take the Polaris 120 we'll hook it up
to<00:02:36.610> will<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> actually<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.480> know<00:02:37.569> what<00:02:37.660> I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
to will you actually you know what I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.350 
to will you actually you know what I
think<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.930> woke<00:02:38.019> up<00:02:38.110> on<00:02:38.349> my<00:02:38.440> ex<00:02:38.470> 58a<00:02:39.310> might<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.760> 27

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
think I woke up on my ex 58a might be 27

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
think I woke up on my ex 58a might be 27
just<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.629> we<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.840> see<00:02:41.019> what<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.410> results

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
just so we can see what kind of results

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.530 
just so we can see what kind of results
were<00:02:41.920> getting<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.670> full<00:02:42.879> review<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.329> for

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.370 
the box of the new swiftech Polaris 120
heatsink<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:48.940> fan<00:02:49.030> combo<00:02:49.600> thanks<00:02:50.230> for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
heatsink and fan combo thanks for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.410
