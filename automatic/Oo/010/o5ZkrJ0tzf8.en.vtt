00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
blank pattern in there and set that up

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280 
blank pattern in there and set that up
right<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.570> then<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> shift<00:03:13.140> right

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
right so and then if you shift right

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400 
right so and then if you shift right
here<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:14.400> gives<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> little<00:03:14.790> more<00:03:14.880> info<00:03:15.410> in

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
here it gives you a little more info in

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.960 
here it gives you a little more info in
case<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.740> have<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:17.040> lots<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.640> stuff<00:03:17.820> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
case you have like lots of stuff you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.390 
case you have like lots of stuff you
know<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.180> goes<00:03:18.300> into<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.510> recipe<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:20.310> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
know that goes into that recipe but on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
know that goes into that recipe but on
the<00:03:20.490> very<00:03:20.520> top<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:20.940> there<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.209> oh<00:03:21.270> shoot

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the very top right there it's oh shoot

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.790 
the very top right there it's oh shoot
four<00:03:21.570> times<00:03:21.750> Styx<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.230> that's<00:03:22.410> what<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.620> makes

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
four times Styx and that's what it makes

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.790 
four times Styx and that's what it makes
right<00:03:23.280> below<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.790> what<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.330> requires<00:03:24.800> so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
right below it is what it requires so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.100 
right below it is what it requires so
cool<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.490> then<00:03:26.610> make<00:03:26.730> these<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:27.990> need

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
cool and then make these you just need

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.260 
cool and then make these you just need
some<00:03:28.230> paper<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.800> lapis<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.060> your

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
some paper in the lapis you get your

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.160 
some paper in the lapis you get your
schematic<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:32.540> over<00:03:33.540> here<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:33.989> can

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
schematic now over here you know you can

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.970 
schematic now over here you know you can
have<00:03:34.320> your<00:03:34.500> liquids<00:03:35.250> say<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:37.680> know<00:03:37.800> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
have your liquids say if you know it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.030 
have your liquids say if you know it's
something<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.370> requires<00:03:38.670> water<00:03:39.770> so<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.920> is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
something that requires water so this is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.760 
something that requires water so this is
kind<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.170> autocracy<00:03:43.170> from<00:03:43.560> mine

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
kind of like the autocracy from mine

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.720 
kind of like the autocracy from mine

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.990 
liquid takes this one has one but it's
got<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> nice<00:03:51.180> big<00:03:51.510> inventory<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.820> can

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
got a nice big inventory here and it can

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.970 
got a nice big inventory here and it can
also<00:03:54.270> be<00:03:54.630> configured<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:55.350> here<00:03:55.500> for

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
also be configured right here for

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.540 
also be configured right here for
various<00:03:56.340> inputs<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.290> or<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:59.130> outputs

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
various inputs like that or in outputs

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.060 
various inputs like that or in outputs
like<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.780> then<00:04:00.900> I've<00:04:01.380> got<00:04:01.560> an<00:04:01.650> example

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
like this and then I've got an example

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.449 
like this and then I've got an example
of<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.430> right<00:04:02.730> over<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.160> here<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.640> am

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
of this right over here so in here I am

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.460 
of this right over here so in here I am
crafting<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.580> some<00:04:08.790> invert<00:04:09.150> boots<00:04:09.360> go<00:04:10.290> ahead

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
crafting up some invert boots go ahead

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.259 
crafting up some invert boots go ahead
and<00:04:12.380> throw<00:04:13.380> for<00:04:13.620> those<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.130> there<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.640> you

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and throw for those in there and you

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.490 
and throw for those in there and you
know<00:04:15.390> what<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.959> already<00:04:15.989> have<00:04:16.229> one<00:04:16.260> in

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
know what I think I already have one in

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.750 
know what I think I already have one in
here<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.479> it'll<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.600> pump<00:04:19.100> all<00:04:20.100> these<00:04:20.459> into

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
here and it'll just pump all these into

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.990 
here and it'll just pump all these into
here<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.180> then<00:04:21.870> any<00:04:22.109> output<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:22.860> set<00:04:23.400> to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
here and then any output you can set to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.590 
here and then any output you can set to
a<00:04:24.360> chest<00:04:25.200> right<00:04:25.770> next<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.280> or<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:27.510> you

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
a chest right next to it or if you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.650 
a chest right next to it or if you
wanted<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:28.860> have<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.160> go<00:04:29.340> up<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.030> out

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
wanted to you can have it go up and out

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.890 
wanted to you can have it go up and out
like<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.590> was<00:04:32.490> messing<00:04:33.450> around<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.750> here

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
like this I was messing around in here

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.060 
like this I was messing around in here
so<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.080> didn't<00:04:34.290> see<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.680> can<00:04:37.830> pipe

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
so we didn't see that but you can pipe

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.580 
so we didn't see that but you can pipe
stuff<00:04:38.430> out<00:04:38.640> or<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.240> have<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.540> go<00:04:39.960> out<00:04:40.200> into

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
stuff out or you can have it go out into

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.690 
stuff out or you can have it go out into
the<00:04:40.620> adjacent<00:04:41.310> inventory<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:44.100> would

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
the adjacent inventory and this would

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.170 
the adjacent inventory and this would
also<00:04:44.850> if<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.479> could<00:04:46.229> figure<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.770> work<00:04:46.950> with

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
also if you could figure it to work with
