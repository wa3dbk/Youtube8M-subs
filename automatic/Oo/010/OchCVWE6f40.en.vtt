00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this for a while and I actually did do

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.849 
this for a while and I actually did do
it<00:00:03.389> but<00:00:04.110> then<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.990> video<00:00:07.230> came<00:00:07.620> out<00:00:07.710> too

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
see it's changed a little bit because

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.370 
see it's changed a little bit because
then<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.880> picked<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> four<00:00:34.170> pack

then I picked up this one in a four pack

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
then I picked up this one in a four pack

with Wolverine Sabretooth and the
Phoenix<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.890> why<00:00:38.370> does<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:38.670> need

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
Phoenix and I was like why does he need

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.170 
Phoenix and I was like why does he need
four<00:00:39.780> swords<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> took<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> arms<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
four swords so I took the arms off the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850 
four swords so I took the arms off the
Punisher<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.379> her<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
Punisher and we put her on that and I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.889 
Punisher and we put her on that and I
did<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> repaint<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.940> fix<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> lot<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
did a repaint on it fix a lot of the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
did a repaint on it fix a lot of the
paint<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.399> came

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
paint really like the way that one came

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
paint really like the way that one came
out<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:49.140> pretty<00:00:49.350> cool<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.920> my

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
out I think it's it's pretty cool if my

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
out I think it's it's pretty cool if my
thing<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.460> focus<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.649> but

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
thing will focus on it but

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
thing will focus on it but
coincidentally<00:00:53.090> after<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> did<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> know

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
coincidentally after I did that you know

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.119 
coincidentally after I did that you know
gave<00:00:54.960> me<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.199> guns<00:00:55.440> since<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:55.949> two

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
gave me two guns since here I had two

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.970 
gave me two guns since here I had two

off a storm shadow and I don't know if
you<00:02:15.300> see<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.810> shaved<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.410> away<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.830> was

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you see it I shaved it away and I was

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.730 
you see it I shaved it away and I was
gonna<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> full<00:02:17.790> repaint<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:19.470> make<00:02:19.590> it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
gonna do a full repaint on it to make it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.170 
gonna do a full repaint on it to make it
look<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.070> scarred<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.490> Deadpool<00:02:20.850> head<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
look like a scarred up Deadpool head and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.750 
look like a scarred up Deadpool head and
then<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.570> realized<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.290> still<00:02:22.800> had<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.010> Marvel

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
then I realized I still had my Marvel

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.930 
then I realized I still had my Marvel
Legends<00:02:25.070> extra<00:02:26.070> Deadpool<00:02:26.490> head<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
Legends extra Deadpool head and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.750 
Legends extra Deadpool head and
coincidentally<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:29.070> falls<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
coincidentally now if it falls down it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
coincidentally now if it falls down it
fits<00:02:30.240> on<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.630> pretty<00:02:31.260> close<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.770> perfectly

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
fits on there pretty close to perfectly

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.900 
fits on there pretty close to perfectly
and<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.870> pop<00:02:34.080> off<00:02:34.290> fairly<00:02:34.710> easily<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.760> now

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and it can pop off fairly easily but now

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.510 
and it can pop off fairly easily but now
it<00:02:36.030> gives<00:02:36.120> me<00:02:36.300> something<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.870> Oh<00:02:37.250> crud

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
it gives me something to do Oh crud

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.760 
it gives me something to do Oh crud
now<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.150> gives<00:02:39.270> me<00:02:39.360> something<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.930> with

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
now it gives me something to do with

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.360 
now it gives me something to do with
that<00:02:40.830> head<00:02:42.560> aside<00:02:43.560> from<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.130> leave

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
that head aside from just you know leave

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.040 
that head aside from just you know leave
it<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:44.550> my<00:02:44.790> bookshelf<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.510> sit<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:45.990> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
it on my bookshelf to sit there and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.420 
it on my bookshelf to sit there and
stare<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.380> me<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.890> me<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> freak<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
stare at me and for me to freak out I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.770 
stare at me and for me to freak out I
don't<00:02:47.520> know<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.820> gonna<00:02:47.940> get<00:02:48.090> lost<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.450> day<00:02:48.600> I

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
don't know it's gonna get lost one day I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.990 
don't know it's gonna get lost one day I
think<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.500> may<00:02:49.710> eventually<00:02:49.920> repaint<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> head

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
think I may eventually repaint the head

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.720 
think I may eventually repaint the head
anyways<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.870> let's<00:02:52.110> face<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.040> does<00:02:53.370> look

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
anyways but let's face it that does look

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.300 
anyways but let's face it that does look
really<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.630> soon<00:02:54.870> as<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.050> focuses<00:02:55.200> come<00:02:56.190> on

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
really as soon as it focuses come on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220 
really as soon as it focuses come on
you're<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> hard<00:02:57.120> computer<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:58.020> does

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you're not that hard computer that does

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.690 
you're not that hard computer that does
look<00:02:58.410> actually<00:02:58.830> pretty<00:02:59.070> awesome<00:02:59.520> like<00:02:59.670> that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
look actually pretty awesome like that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
look actually pretty awesome like that
with<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.240> head<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.230> yeah<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.410> can

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
with that head on there so yeah I can

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.950 
with that head on there so yeah I can
like<00:03:01.740> turn<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.100> move<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> how<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.640> want<00:03:02.970> doesn't

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
like turn it move it how I want doesn't

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.990 
like turn it move it how I want doesn't
pop<00:03:04.290> off<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.950> leap<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.310> overall<00:03:05.850> I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
pop off that it is leap but overall I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.940 
pop off that it is leap but overall I
think<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.360> looks<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.530> cool<00:03:07.740> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
think it looks really really cool and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.560 
think it looks really really cool and
then<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.310> course<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.790> weapon<00:03:08.940> 11<00:03:09.390> back

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
then of course I have the weapon 11 back
