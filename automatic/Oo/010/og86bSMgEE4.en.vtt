a<00:00:10.380> Phoenician<00:00:10.889> stick<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.370> originally<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.969> gone

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
a Phoenician stick I originally had gone

a Phoenician stick I originally had gone

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to CVS to pick this up but all of these

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.330 
to CVS to pick this up but all of these
shades<00:00:15.450> were<00:00:15.960> pretty<00:00:16.289> much<00:00:16.440> compromised<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
shades were pretty much compromised and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
shades were pretty much compromised and
they<00:00:17.430> were<00:00:17.520> open<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> didn't<00:00:18.660> pick<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.960> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
they were open so I didn't pick it up so

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.570 
they were open so I didn't pick it up so
I<00:00:19.140> ended<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.410> picking<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.160> Walmart

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I ended up picking this up at Walmart

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120 
I ended up picking this up at Walmart
surprisingly<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.230> had<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> whole<00:00:22.800> bunch

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
surprisingly and they had a whole bunch

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
surprisingly and they had a whole bunch
it<00:00:23.699> retails<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.300> six<00:00:24.600> dollars<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it retails for about six dollars and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
it retails for about six dollars and
ninety<00:00:25.289> seven<00:00:25.619> cents<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.279> pretty

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
ninety seven cents so it is pretty

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
ninety seven cents so it is pretty
inexpensive<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.900> foundation<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
inexpensive for foundation but when you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
inexpensive for foundation but when you
look<00:00:29.099> at<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:29.820> pretty<00:00:29.970> small<00:00:30.390> I

foundation stick and so long so let's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520 
foundation stick and so long so let's
see<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.809> like<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> circle<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> middle

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and I believe that's a jelly part of the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
and I believe that's a jelly part of the
foundation<00:01:09.110> not<00:01:10.110> exactly<00:01:10.470> sure<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.710> remember

there's<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> gel<00:01:11.790> part<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
there's like a gel part of the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
there's like a gel part of the
foundation<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.890> we'll<00:01:14.130> see

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
foundation but and I know we'll see

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.300 

my<00:02:00.200> cheek<00:02:02.290> actually<00:02:03.290> i<00:02:03.320> think<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:04.130> my<00:02:04.159> color<00:02:04.700> I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.730 
my cheek actually i think is my color I
think<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.729> little<00:02:07.850> bit<00:02:08.410> darker<00:02:09.410> than<00:02:09.440> I

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
think it's a little bit darker than I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.490 
think it's a little bit darker than I
expected<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:10.850> if<00:02:11.000> I'm<00:02:11.150> just<00:02:11.300> gonna<00:02:11.500> gonna

expected to be if I'm just gonna gonna
play<00:02:12.860> everywhere<00:02:16.989> like<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.709> gonna<00:02:18.800> take

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
play everywhere like that I'm gonna take

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.430 
play everywhere like that I'm gonna take
a<00:02:19.010> kabuki<00:02:19.459> brush<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.000> kind<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:21.310> blend<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.489> out

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
a kabuki brush and kind of blend it out

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.620 
a kabuki brush and kind of blend it out
she<00:02:24.440> feels<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:24.860> smooth<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.970> far<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
she feels really smooth as far as the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.470 
she feels really smooth as far as the
color<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.019> think<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> color<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.769> really<00:02:34.610> nice<00:02:35.000> I

color I think the color is really nice I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.410 
color I think the color is really nice I
think<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.110> perfect<00:02:36.730> make<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.910> matches<00:02:38.269> my

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
think it's perfect make it matches my

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.509 
think it's perfect make it matches my
skin<00:02:38.480> pretty<00:02:38.930> well<00:02:39.170> considering<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.800> I'm<00:02:40.489> a

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
skin pretty well considering that I'm a

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.520 
skin pretty well considering that I'm a
little<00:02:41.060> tan<00:02:41.390> right<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:44.170> it'll<00:02:45.170> end<00:02:45.410> it

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
little tan right now so it'll end it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.470 
little tan right now so it'll end it
into<00:02:45.800> my<00:02:45.950> skin<00:02:46.340> really<00:02:46.519> nicely<00:02:46.970> with<00:02:47.300> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
into my skin really nicely with this

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.080 
into my skin really nicely with this
kabuki<00:02:48.319> brush<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.040> definitely<00:02:49.280> even<00:02:49.970> out

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
kabuki brush and it definitely even out

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.780

my<00:02:50.120> skin<00:02:50.269> tone<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.110> would<00:02:52.069> say<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.430> more<00:02:52.519> of<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.930 
my skin tone I would say it's more of a
light<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.180> medium<00:02:53.420> coverage<00:02:53.870> foundation<00:02:54.940> you

before<00:05:27.160> your<00:05:27.310> face<00:05:27.460> gets<00:05:27.730> super<00:05:28.090> oily<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:28.630> it's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
before your face gets super oily so it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.810 
before your face gets super oily so it's
like<00:05:28.900> kind<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.440> oily<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:29.920> kind<00:05:30.370> of<00:05:30.490> shiny

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
around here and around here I wouldn't

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.630 
around here and around here I wouldn't
say<00:05:35.140> that<00:05:35.170> this<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.710> like<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.890> shine<00:05:36.250> free

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.820 
say that this is like a shine free
foundation<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.780> think<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.170> goes<00:05:38.350> on<00:05:38.650> very

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
foundation I think it goes on very

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.360 
foundation I think it goes on very
smooth<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:40.900> mean

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
smooth and I mean

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.610 
smooth and I mean
has<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.790> right<00:05:42.479> coverage<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> best

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
has a right coverage not the best

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.020 
has a right coverage not the best
