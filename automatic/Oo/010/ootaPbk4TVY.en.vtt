first of all so for this first a little

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.099 
first of all so for this first a little
lesson<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.880> want<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> show<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.929> bit

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
lesson I just want to show a little bit

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.810 
lesson I just want to show a little bit
about<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.740> hand<00:00:32.009> techniques<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.700> take

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
about right hand techniques but take

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.819 
about right hand techniques but take
particularly<00:00:33.360> whatever<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:34.050> strumming

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
particularly whatever you are strumming

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.060 
particularly whatever you are strumming
a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.480> 10<00:00:36.860> whenever<00:00:37.860> they're

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a lot of people 10 whenever they're

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
a lot of people 10 whenever they're
strumming<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:39.120> tend<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> move

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
strumming they tend to want to move

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.600 
strumming they tend to want to move
their<00:00:40.350> arm<00:00:41.030> kind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
their arm kind of like this it's the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
their arm kind of like this it's the
same<00:00:44.910> motion<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> make<00:00:46.079> whenever

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
same motion that you make whenever

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.490 
same motion that you make whenever
you're<00:00:47.160> wiping<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.610> table<00:00:48.059> off<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:49.200> wrists

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you're wiping a table off your wrists

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400 
you're wiping a table off your wrists
can<00:00:49.739> make<00:00:49.980> three<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:51.090> distinct<00:00:51.750> kinds<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can make three pretty distinct kinds of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.700 
can make three pretty distinct kinds of
motion<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.850> motion<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.260> wiping<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
motion one is that motion the wiping a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.810 
motion one is that motion the wiping a
table<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.219> motion<00:00:56.809> another<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
table off motion another one is the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
table off motion another one is the
rotation<00:00:59.820> motion<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.410> kind

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
rotation motion like this which is kind

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
rotation motion like this which is kind
of<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.710> opening<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.340> doorknob<00:01:03.439> going<00:01:04.439> like

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
of like opening up a doorknob going like

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.740 
of like opening up a doorknob going like
this<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> prefer<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.630> use

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
this but the one that I prefer to use

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
this but the one that I prefer to use
the<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> think<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.710> helps<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the one that I think really helps just

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.510 
the one that I think really helps just
as<00:01:09.510> far<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.810> expression<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:11.100> far<00:01:11.400> as

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
as far as expression goes as far as

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
as far as expression goes as far as
range<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.630> far<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.869> efficiency<00:01:13.380> goes<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
range and as far as efficiency goes is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
range and as far as efficiency goes is
the<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> throwing<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.439> Frisbee<00:01:16.799> motion<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the the throwing of Frisbee motion so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
the the throwing of Frisbee motion so
it's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.479> motion<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.460> notice

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's a motion just like this you notice

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's a motion just like this you notice
that<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.060> arm<00:01:21.350> doesn't<00:01:22.350> rotate<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:24.060> like

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that my arm doesn't rotate at all like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
that my arm doesn't rotate at all like
this<00:01:25.189> I'm<00:01:26.189> doing<00:01:26.580> straight

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this I'm doing straight

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
this I'm doing straight
up<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.399> like<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.700> puppet<00:01:30.210> saying

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
up and down kind of like a puppet saying

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.490 
up and down kind of like a puppet saying
yes<00:01:31.469> you<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.429> that<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.960> reason<00:01:34.170> why<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.289> use

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
yes you see that so the reason why I use

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.719 
yes you see that so the reason why I use
that<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.270> large<00:01:36.570> range<00:01:37.729> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that one you get a very large range to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.480 
that one you get a very large range to
you're<00:01:39.719> using<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.140> much<00:01:40.530> larger<00:01:40.979> muscle<00:01:41.369> in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're using a much larger muscle in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
you're using a much larger muscle in
your<00:01:41.520> arm<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.380> more<00:01:43.560> strength

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
your arm so you get a lot more strength

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.090 
your arm so you get a lot more strength
but<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.299> don't<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.569> to<00:01:45.659> work<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.049> hard

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
but also you don't have to work as hard

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.480 
but also you don't have to work as hard
all<00:01:47.100> right

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
all right

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
all right
so<00:01:47.789> whereas<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.569> you<00:01:48.659> use<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.959> other<00:01:49.110> methods

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so whereas if you use the other methods

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
so whereas if you use the other methods
you<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.219> smaller<00:01:50.610> range<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> end

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you get a much smaller range and you end

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.969 
you get a much smaller range and you end
up<00:01:51.569> having<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> use<00:01:51.959> your<00:01:51.990> arm<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.860> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
up having to use your arm a lot more to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
up having to use your arm a lot more to
compensate<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> let<00:01:54.750> me<00:01:54.840> demonstrate<00:01:54.959> it<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
compensate so let me demonstrate it a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.059 
compensate so let me demonstrate it a
little<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:57.170> let's<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.319> here<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.829> go<00:01:58.920> just

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
little bit let's see here we go just

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.819 
little bit let's see here we go just
this<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.490> down<00:01:59.700> down<00:01:59.939> up<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.179> down<00:02:00.360> up

louder like for instance if I want to
accent<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> note<00:02:26.280> I'll<00:02:27.060> use<00:02:27.270> my<00:02:27.300> farm<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.140> do

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
accent a note I'll use my farm to do

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.250 
accent a note I'll use my farm to do
that<00:02:28.500> accent<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.100> get<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.780> accent

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that accent so I get so you can accent

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.030 
that accent so I get so you can accent
right<00:02:34.860> there<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.290> allows<00:02:40.560> me<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.800> get

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
right there so this allows me to get

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
right there so this allows me to get
just<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> little<00:02:41.490> more<00:02:41.820> strength<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
just a little more strength out of it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.050 
just a little more strength out of it
than<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.410> use<00:02:43.590> normally<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.610> also<00:02:44.730> allows

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
than I use normally but it also allows

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
than I use normally but it also allows
me<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.390> keep<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.630> very<00:02:46.080> simple<00:02:46.470> motion<00:02:46.650> going

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
me to keep that very simple motion going

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550 
me to keep that very simple motion going
in<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> right<00:02:47.460> hand<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.540> uh<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:49.320> allows

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
in the right hand so we see uh it allows

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.180 
in the right hand so we see uh it allows
me<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.740> lot<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.980> speed<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.320> also<00:02:55.500> more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
me a lot of speed you know but also more

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.410 
me a lot of speed you know but also more
importantly<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.850> allows<00:02:56.910> me<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> lot<00:02:57.330> of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
importantly it allows me a lot of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.960 
importantly it allows me a lot of
expression<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.640> I'm<00:02:59.790> going

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
expression I can really get if I'm going

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270 
expression I can really get if I'm going
to<00:03:00.060> fairly<00:03:00.510> complicated<00:03:01.010> strumming<00:03:02.010> pattern

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
to fairly complicated strumming pattern

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.040 
to fairly complicated strumming pattern
I<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.240> lots<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.660> light<00:03:03.810> nice

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
I can you know get lots of light nice

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.600 
I can you know get lots of light nice
little<00:03:04.350> accents<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.130> change<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.490> around

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
little accents you know change it around

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:37.349 
little accents you know change it around
a<00:03:05.760> little<00:03:05.850> bit

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.849 

so<00:03:38.430> let's<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.579> now<00:03:40.379> how<00:03:41.379> do<00:03:41.439> you<00:03:41.560> get<00:03:41.739> that

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
so let's see now how do you get that

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.500 
so let's see now how do you get that
motion<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.489> how<00:03:42.639> do<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.790> actually<00:03:43.030> apply<00:03:43.450> it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
motion and how do you actually apply it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.300 
motion and how do you actually apply it
to<00:03:43.689> guitar<00:03:44.049> now<00:03:44.439> the<00:03:44.499> biggest<00:03:44.829> problem<00:03:44.980> that

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
to guitar now the biggest problem that

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.149 
to guitar now the biggest problem that
most<00:03:46.060> people<00:03:46.209> have<00:03:46.420> with<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.499> motion<00:03:47.769> is

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
most people have with this motion is

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.199 
most people have with this motion is
that<00:03:48.549> if<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.689> can<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:50.189> my<00:03:51.189> wrist<00:03:51.549> is<00:03:51.760> moving

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
that if you can see my wrist is moving

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.309 
that if you can see my wrist is moving
like<00:03:52.599> this<00:03:52.829> if<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.920> imagine<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.459> car<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.870> just

like this if you imagine the car is just
like<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.639> if<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.480> see<00:03:58.689> the<00:03:59.019> pic<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.590> on

to kind of turn their pick down so that

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.899 
to kind of turn their pick down so that
it's<00:04:40.630> pointing<00:04:40.840> upwards<00:04:41.699> whenever<00:04:42.699> they're

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
it's pointing upwards whenever they're

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.790 
it's pointing upwards whenever they're
doing<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.990> strumming<00:04:44.289> this<00:04:44.409> way<00:04:44.560> you're

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
doing the strumming this way you're

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.290 
doing the strumming this way you're
building<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.699> then<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.909> end<00:04:46.090> up<00:04:46.150> having

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
building this and then you end up having

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.480 
building this and then you end up having
to<00:04:46.449> get<00:04:46.599> a<00:04:46.659> lot<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.080> extra<00:04:47.380> right<00:04:47.740> hand<00:04:48.009> motion

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
to get a lot of extra right hand motion

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.610 
to get a lot of extra right hand motion
whatever<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.360> doing<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:50.320> you<00:04:50.440> really

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
whatever you doing that what you really

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.680 
whatever you doing that what you really
want<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.949> be<00:04:51.039> able<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.220> do<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.330> take<00:04:52.479> that

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
want to be able to do is to take that

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.469 
want to be able to do is to take that
pick<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.229> have<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.979> be<00:04:54.099> perpendicular<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:55.150> the

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
pick and have it be perpendicular to the

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.700 
pick and have it be perpendicular to the
guitar<00:04:56.729> like<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.750> reason<00:04:59.050> why<00:04:59.199> is

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
guitar like that and the reason why is

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.270 
guitar like that and the reason why is
because<00:04:59.770> if<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.250> do<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.330> allows<00:05:01.659> you<00:05:01.930> to

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
because if you do that it allows you to

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080 
because if you do that it allows you to
go<00:05:03.280> down<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:04.690> then<00:05:05.349> back<00:05:05.380> up<00:05:05.800> again<00:05:06.090> without

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
go down and then back up again without

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.220 
go down and then back up again without
having<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.509> make<00:05:07.659> any

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
having to make any

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.080 
having to make any
extra<00:05:08.800> motion<00:05:09.070> in<00:05:09.520> your<00:05:09.670> right<00:05:09.880> hand<00:05:09.910> so<00:05:10.720> yeah

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.990 

okay<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.900> allows<00:05:17.290> you<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:18.790> more

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
okay so that allows you to just more

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.090 
okay so that allows you to just more
efficiently<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.900> it's<00:05:20.470> more<00:05:20.710> efficient

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
efficiently it just it's more efficient

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.650 
efficiently it just it's more efficient
it<00:05:21.190> allows<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.610> kind<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.880> take<00:05:22.120> out<00:05:22.390> a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
it allows you to kind of take out a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.260 
it allows you to kind of take out a
level<00:05:23.290> of<00:05:23.590> thought<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.160> goes<00:05:24.340> into<00:05:24.370> plank<00:05:25.060> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
level of thought that goes into plank it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.490 
level of thought that goes into plank it
allows<00:05:25.450> you<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.660> really<00:05:25.750> simplify<00:05:26.320> your

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
allows you to really simplify your

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.920 
allows you to really simplify your
motion

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.219 

as<00:05:32.889> opposed<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.610> if<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.270> if<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.660> hold<00:05:34.870> my<00:05:34.930> pick

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
as opposed to if I if I hold my pick

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.310 
as opposed to if I if I hold my pick
kind<00:05:35.949> of<00:05:36.039> more<00:05:36.360> you<00:05:37.360> know<00:05:37.419> pointing<00:05:37.900> up<00:05:38.080> or

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
kind of more you know pointing up or

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.050 
kind of more you know pointing up or
pointing<00:05:38.650> down<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.160> don't<00:05:39.610> have<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:39.850> make<00:05:40.030> a

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
pointing down I don't have to make a

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.550 
pointing down I don't have to make a
motion<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.630> was<00:05:40.690> kind<00:05:40.930> of<00:05:40.960> more<00:05:41.139> like<00:05:41.289> this

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
motion that was kind of more like this

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.050 
motion that was kind of more like this
now<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.860> see<00:05:41.949> people<00:05:42.370> do<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.610> kind<00:05:42.669> of<00:05:42.850> thing

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
now you see people do that kind of thing

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.719 
now you see people do that kind of thing
but<00:05:43.750> this<00:05:44.020> is<00:05:44.169> not<00:05:44.350> quite<00:05:44.500> as<00:05:44.680> efficient<00:05:45.160> and

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
but this is not quite as efficient and

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.670 
but this is not quite as efficient and
you<00:05:45.910> can't<00:05:46.180> quite<00:05:46.389> get<00:05:47.229> quite<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.650> much

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
you can't quite get quite as much

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.650 
you can't quite get quite as much
expression<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.669> different<00:05:48.940> kinds<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.210> sounds

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
expression and different kinds of sounds

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
expression and different kinds of sounds
yeah<00:05:51.990> because<00:05:52.990> you're<00:05:53.289> having<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.500> think

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
yeah because you're having to think

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.570 
yeah because you're having to think
about<00:05:53.800> an<00:05:54.160> extra<00:05:54.610> motion<00:05:54.870> so<00:05:56.070> let's<00:05:57.070> see<00:05:57.190> the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
about an extra motion so let's see the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.439 
about an extra motion so let's see the
other<00:05:58.150> problem<00:05:58.509> people<00:05:58.630> have<00:05:58.750> with<00:06:00.210> this<00:06:01.210> kind

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
other problem people have with this kind

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.060 
other problem people have with this kind
of<00:06:01.509> motion<00:06:01.690> is<00:06:02.400> there's<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.490> tendency<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:05.740> hold

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
of motion is there's a tendency to hold

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.089 
of motion is there's a tendency to hold
your<00:06:06.310> pic<00:06:06.550> flat<00:06:07.440> against<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.530> guitar<00:06:08.830> and<00:06:08.979> I

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
your pic flat against the guitar and I

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.749 
your pic flat against the guitar and I
might<00:06:09.310> have<00:06:09.340> come<00:06:10.180> pretty<00:06:10.509> close<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:12.400> make<00:06:12.610> it

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
might have come pretty close to make it

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.670 
might have come pretty close to make it
so<00:06:12.880> that's<00:06:13.060> your<00:06:13.180> pic<00:06:13.449> will<00:06:14.259> hit<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.560> guitar

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
so that's your pic will hit the guitar

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.719 
so that's your pic will hit the guitar
flat<00:06:15.310> like<00:06:15.639> this<00:06:17.340> hopefully<00:06:18.340> you<00:06:18.430> can<00:06:18.550> see

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
flat like this hopefully you can see

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.360 
flat like this hopefully you can see
that<00:06:18.910> um<00:06:19.630> what<00:06:20.020> you<00:06:20.139> want<00:06:20.349> to<00:06:20.440> do<00:06:20.620> is<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.220> want

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
that um what you want to do is you want

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.870 
that um what you want to do is you want
to<00:06:21.400> actually<00:06:21.520> turn<00:06:21.970> your<00:06:22.030> pic<00:06:22.419> a<00:06:22.720> little<00:06:23.440> bit

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
to actually turn your pic a little bit

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.540 
to actually turn your pic a little bit
so<00:06:25.500> demonstrate<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.590> this<00:06:26.650> way<00:06:26.800> if<00:06:27.220> this<00:06:27.400> is

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
so demonstrate it this way if this is

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.420 
so demonstrate it this way if this is
the<00:06:27.729> string<00:06:28.259> then<00:06:29.259> the<00:06:29.289> pic<00:06:29.650> you<00:06:29.979> don't<00:06:30.220> want

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
the string then the pic you don't want

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.040 
the string then the pic you don't want
it<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.580> lay<00:06:30.729> down<00:06:30.940> flat<00:06:31.270> on<00:06:31.419> little<00:06:31.840> on<00:06:31.930> the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
it to lay down flat on little on the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.749 
it to lay down flat on little on the
string<00:06:32.289> like<00:06:32.470> this<00:06:32.680> you<00:06:33.190> want<00:06:33.370> have<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.580> hit

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
string like this you want have to hit

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.450 
string like this you want have to hit
the<00:06:33.880> string<00:06:34.150> either<00:06:34.389> this<00:06:34.750> angle<00:06:35.320> or<00:06:36.070> that

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
the string either this angle or that

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.909 
the string either this angle or that
angle<00:06:37.080> different<00:06:38.080> people's<00:06:38.320> palms<00:06:38.590> work

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
angle different people's palms work

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.029 
angle different people's palms work
different<00:06:39.280> way<00:06:39.370> so<00:06:40.229> for<00:06:41.229> me<00:06:41.380> it<00:06:41.620> works<00:06:41.800> better

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
different way so for me it works better

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:47.250 
different way so for me it works better
if<00:06:42.340> I<00:06:42.430> have<00:06:42.610> my<00:06:42.760> tape<00:06:43.000> angled<00:06:43.419> like<00:06:43.810> this<00:06:46.260> and

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
if I have my tape angled like this and

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.320 
if I have my tape angled like this and
what<00:06:47.380> that<00:06:47.500> allows<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:47.949> do<00:06:48.130> that<00:06:49.000> allows

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
what that allows you to do that allows

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.210 
what that allows you to do that allows
whenever<00:06:50.080> your<00:06:50.260> pic<00:06:50.470> hits<00:06:50.770> the<00:06:50.949> string

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
whenever your pic hits the string

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.909 
whenever your pic hits the string
instead<00:06:51.789> of<00:06:51.849> being<00:06:52.180> like<00:06:52.330> a<00:06:52.360> brick<00:06:52.750> wall<00:06:52.919> like

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
instead of being like a brick wall like

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.490 
instead of being like a brick wall like
this<00:06:54.400> which<00:06:55.180> forces<00:06:55.210> you<00:06:55.810> to<00:06:55.840> kind<00:06:56.080> of<00:06:56.229> turn

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
this which forces you to kind of turn

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.429 
this which forces you to kind of turn
your<00:06:56.530> pic<00:06:56.919> down<00:06:57.880> or<00:06:58.270> up<00:06:58.510> you<00:06:59.169> know

00:06:59.429 --> 00:06:59.439 
your pic down or up you know

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.929 
your pic down or up you know
not<00:07:00.279> moral<00:07:00.759> into<00:07:01.059> that<00:07:01.239> it<00:07:02.169> allows<00:07:02.409> you<00:07:02.649> to

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:02.939 
not moral into that it allows you to

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.779 
not moral into that it allows you to
make<00:07:03.939> the<00:07:04.149> pick<00:07:04.449> kind<00:07:05.379> of<00:07:05.529> move<00:07:06.009> the<00:07:06.249> string<00:07:06.550> so

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
make the pick kind of move the string so

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:07.889 
make the pick kind of move the string so
you<00:07:06.849> get<00:07:07.029> it's<00:07:07.179> kind<00:07:07.330> of<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.449> little<00:07:07.569> motorcycle

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899 
you get it's kind of a little motorcycle

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:12.379 
you get it's kind of a little motorcycle
right<00:07:08.199> after<00:07:08.349> you<00:07:08.409> good<00:07:08.529> boom

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.420 

so<00:07:12.990> the<00:07:13.169> string<00:07:13.500> gets<00:07:13.800> out<00:07:13.949> of<00:07:13.979> the<00:07:14.129> way<00:07:14.250> of<00:07:14.370> the

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
so the string gets out of the way of the

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.279 
so the string gets out of the way of the
pic<00:07:14.699> instead<00:07:15.210> of<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.360> pic<00:07:15.569> having<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.080> get<00:07:16.199> out

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
pic instead of the pic having to get out

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:17.600 
pic instead of the pic having to get out
of<00:07:16.379> the<00:07:16.439> way<00:07:16.530> the<00:07:16.710> string<00:07:16.949> okay<00:07:17.310> that<00:07:17.460> makes

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
of the way the string okay that makes

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.089 
of the way the string okay that makes
sense<00:07:17.669> so<00:07:18.569> as<00:07:18.900> a<00:07:19.199> result<00:07:19.500> if<00:07:19.740> you<00:07:19.800> get<00:07:19.949> those

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 
sense so as a result if you get those

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.279 
sense so as a result if you get those
three<00:07:20.219> elements<00:07:20.430> together<00:07:20.759> one<00:07:21.449> the<00:07:22.020> risk

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:22.289 
three elements together one the risk

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.540 
three elements together one the risk
motion<00:07:23.180> to<00:07:24.180> the<00:07:24.900> pic<00:07:25.289> being<00:07:25.740> perpendicular<00:07:26.520> to

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
motion to the pic being perpendicular to

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.730 
motion to the pic being perpendicular to
the<00:07:26.729> guitar<00:07:27.139> sticking<00:07:28.139> straight<00:07:28.409> into<00:07:28.650> the

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
the guitar sticking straight into the

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.890 
the guitar sticking straight into the
guitar<00:07:28.830> and<00:07:29.219> also<00:07:29.699> the<00:07:29.969> pic<00:07:30.240> of<00:07:30.599> being<00:07:30.840> a

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
guitar and also the pic of being a

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.800 
guitar and also the pic of being a
slight<00:07:31.259> angle<00:07:31.590> to<00:07:31.830> the<00:07:32.099> strings<00:07:32.490> this<00:07:33.360> way<00:07:33.569> as

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
slight angle to the strings this way as

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.420 
slight angle to the strings this way as
opposed<00:07:34.110> to<00:07:34.169> being<00:07:34.349> flat<00:07:34.680> on<00:07:34.860> the<00:07:34.949> string<00:07:35.300> then

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
opposed to being flat on the string then

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.980 
opposed to being flat on the string then
it<00:07:38.430> allows<00:07:38.639> you<00:07:38.789> to<00:07:38.879> get<00:07:39.000> a<00:07:39.060> very<00:07:39.389> very<00:07:39.659> smooth

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:39.990 
it allows you to get a very very smooth

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.619 
it allows you to get a very very smooth
and<00:07:40.289> very<00:07:40.349> very<00:07:40.770> simple<00:07:41.039> and<00:07:41.460> fast<00:07:41.669> and

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:42.629 
and very very simple and fast and

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:49.190 
and very very simple and fast and
expressive

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.200 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.050 

all<00:07:50.100> right<00:07:50.220> so<00:07:50.430> hopefully<00:07:50.610> this<00:07:50.940> has<00:07:51.000> been

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 
all right so hopefully this has been

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.420 
all right so hopefully this has been
helpful<00:07:51.150> and<00:07:51.660> I<00:07:52.620> believe<00:07:52.980> I'm<00:07:53.100> gonna<00:07:53.220> have<00:07:53.400> a
