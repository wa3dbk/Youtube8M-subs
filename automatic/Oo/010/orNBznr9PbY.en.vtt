00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
was my plan we thought the defensive

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.659 
was my plan we thought the defensive
front<00:04:17.940> was<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.510> was<00:04:18.780> good<00:04:19.430> we<00:04:20.430> thought<00:04:20.609> that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
account for the quarterback so that's

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.180 
account for the quarterback so that's
what<00:04:24.840> we<00:04:24.930> did<00:04:24.960> how<00:04:25.470> do<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.650> think<00:04:25.770> he<00:04:25.919> did<00:04:26.070> in

think<00:06:14.559> football<00:06:14.979> is<00:06:15.189> football<00:06:15.549> I<00:06:16.059> think<00:06:16.989> the

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:17.049 
think football is football I think the

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:18.989 
think football is football I think the
talent<00:06:17.439> in<00:06:17.499> this<00:06:17.589> conference<00:06:17.949> is<00:06:18.159> excellent<00:06:18.699> I

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:18.999 
talent in this conference is excellent I

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.469 
talent in this conference is excellent I
think<00:06:19.569> it's<00:06:20.369> it's<00:06:21.369> equal<00:06:21.759> across<00:06:21.969> the<00:06:22.089> board

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
think it's it's equal across the board

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.779 
think it's it's equal across the board
for<00:06:22.629> the<00:06:22.749> most<00:06:22.959> part<00:06:23.229> so<00:06:23.709> it<00:06:24.129> all<00:06:24.459> comes<00:06:24.639> down

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
for the most part so it all comes down

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.289 
for the most part so it all comes down
to<00:06:24.909> execution<00:06:25.079> but<00:06:26.079> no<00:06:26.349> in<00:06:26.619> terms<00:06:26.860> of<00:06:27.299> your
