the video showing the brushless upgrade

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.499 
the video showing the brushless upgrade
I<00:00:10.380> did<00:00:10.769> not<00:00:10.920> show<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.519> battery<00:00:11.969> fits<00:00:12.210> in

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
I did not show how the battery fits in

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.189 
I did not show how the battery fits in
okay<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.830> fact<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.099> had<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> request<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:15.199> my

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
okay in fact I had a request on my

channel<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.650> show<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.760> battery<00:00:18.029> fits<00:00:18.240> in

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
channel to show how the battery fits in

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.580 
channel to show how the battery fits in
so<00:00:18.690> hopefully<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.230> clear<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.560> things

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590

instead of reaming on it with a sharp
knife<00:00:46.700> which<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> could<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> took<00:00:49.020> an

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
exacto knife and I took a torch to it to
heat<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.770> cut<00:00:53.070> through<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
heat it up so just cut through the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
heat it up so just cut through the
plastic<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.940> butter<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.910> cut

this is to hold the battery secure from
moving<00:01:15.689> around<00:01:16.130> through<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> do

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
moving around through this if you do

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
moving around through this if you do
this<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.110> sure<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:20.009> too<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

another thing you have to do is make

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.060 
another thing you have to do is make
sure<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.110> wires<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> way

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
sure all your wires are out of the way

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.760 
sure all your wires are out of the way
so<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> push<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> battery<00:01:27.600> in

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
so when you push the battery in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.080 
so when you push the battery in
especially<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> wing<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
won't push any of the wires out of the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
won't push any of the wires out of the
way<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.250> possibly<00:01:32.430> disconnect<00:01:33.119> anything<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
way and possibly disconnect anything so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.630 
way and possibly disconnect anything so
make<00:01:34.439> sure<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> clear<00:01:35.009> path<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
make sure it's a clear path for the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.630 
make sure it's a clear path for the
battery<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> come<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.710> okay<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> reason<00:01:38.009> why<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
battery to come up okay the reason why I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
battery to come up okay the reason why I
just<00:01:39.060> put<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> couple<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.600> pieces<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.990> velcro

just put a couple of pieces of velcro

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
just put a couple of pieces of velcro
here<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.880> here's<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> battery<00:01:42.420> looks

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
here and here's what the battery looks

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
here and here's what the battery looks
like<00:01:42.750> -<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.930> put<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> hard<00:01:43.950> velcro<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
like - I put the hard velcro here

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
like - I put the hard velcro here
actually<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.630> velcro<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.110> -<00:01:46.320> but

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
actually have some velcro here - but
that's<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.340> use<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.759> other

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that's so I can use it with my other

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
that's so I can use it with my other
planes<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.890> velcro

that<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.990> side<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.610> really<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.759> holds

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that the this side is really what holds

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
that the this side is really what holds
the<00:01:54.090> battery<00:01:54.299> secure<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.200> Super<00:01:55.500> Cub<00:01:55.680> from

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the battery secure in my Super Cub from

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490 
the battery secure in my Super Cub from
moving<00:01:56.549> around<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> use

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
moving around and you don't want to use

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
moving around and you don't want to use
too<00:01:58.710> much<00:01:58.829> velcro<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.490> here

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
too much velcro on here

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.260 
too much velcro on here
the<00:02:01.049> reason<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.530> it'll<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.460> tough<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.939> pull<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the reason is it'll be tough to pull the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.499 
the reason is it'll be tough to pull the
battery<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> keep<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.590> wing<00:02:04.740> on

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
battery out when you keep the wing on

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.020 
battery out when you keep the wing on
right<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.429> just<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
right now I have it just just so where I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.240 
right now I have it just just so where I
can<00:02:09.209> keep<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> wing<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.170> take<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
can keep the wing on and take the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.059 
can keep the wing on and take the
battery<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.060> out

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
battery in and out

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.530 
battery in and out
without<00:02:13.310> too<00:02:13.459> much<00:02:13.579> trouble<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.450> just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
without too much trouble so it's just

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.319 
without too much trouble so it's just
enough<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.930> keep<00:02:15.079> it<00:02:15.230> from<00:02:15.650> moving<00:02:15.769> around<00:02:15.920> but

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
enough to keep it from moving around but

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.550 
enough to keep it from moving around but
you<00:02:17.329> know<00:02:17.420> not<00:02:17.629> too<00:02:17.780> much<00:02:17.989> from<00:02:18.230> getting<00:02:18.469> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
you know not too much from getting it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.559 
you know not too much from getting it
real<00:02:18.680> stuck<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.129> there<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.579> okay

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
real stuck in there so okay

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.240 
real stuck in there so okay
show<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.409> how<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> battery<00:02:22.069> fits<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.609> there

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
show you how the battery fits in there

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.520 
show you how the battery fits in there
all<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:26.409> okay

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
all right now okay

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.970 
all right now okay
it<00:02:27.829> fits<00:02:28.459> vertically<00:02:29.269> okay<00:02:30.140> stands<00:02:30.799> up

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it fits vertically okay stands up

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.280 
it fits vertically okay stands up
vertically<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.000> pretty<00:02:32.930> obvious

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
vertically like this and pretty obvious

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.009 
vertically like this and pretty obvious
but<00:02:33.700> when<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.790> push<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> battery<00:02:35.239> in<00:02:35.569> you're

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
but when you push the battery in you're

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.619 
but when you push the battery in you're
going<00:02:36.109> to<00:02:36.170> want<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.409> push<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:38.709> okay<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.629> you

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
going to want to push it in okay and you

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.839 
going to want to push it in okay and you
hear<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.840> bell<00:02:42.079> curl<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.579> will<00:02:43.670> kind

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
hear that bell curl you really will kind

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.250 
hear that bell curl you really will kind
of<00:02:43.879> want<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> wiggle<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.569> around<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.930> little<00:02:45.019> bit

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
of want to wiggle it around a little bit

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.610 
of want to wiggle it around a little bit
up<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.040> down<00:02:46.129> just<00:02:46.579> so<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.659> velcro<00:02:47.900> has

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
up and down just so the velcro has

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.530 
up and down just so the velcro has
enough<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:49.939> attach<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.420> that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
enough to to really attach to that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.110 
enough to to really attach to that
battery<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.489> flip<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.609> over<00:02:52.700> see<00:02:52.909> if<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.030> looks

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
battery so flip it over see if it looks

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.960 
battery so flip it over see if it looks
like<00:02:53.269> inside<00:02:56.230> okay<00:02:57.310> that's<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.609> battery

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
like inside okay that's how the battery

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.899 
like inside okay that's how the battery
sits<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.389> there<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.659> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.870> see<00:03:00.519> both<00:03:01.519> sides

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
sits in there and you can see both sides

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.789 
sits in there and you can see both sides
of<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> velcro<00:03:02.480> pieces<00:03:02.659> touch<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.530> battery

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
of the velcro pieces touch the battery

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.140 
of the velcro pieces touch the battery
hold<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.129> real<00:03:04.280> secure<00:03:04.669> it's<00:03:04.819> not<00:03:04.939> going<00:03:05.060> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
hold it real secure it's not going to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.170 
hold it real secure it's not going to
move<00:03:05.209> around<00:03:05.359> at<00:03:05.599> all<00:03:06.819> so<00:03:07.819> that's<00:03:07.939> all<00:03:08.150> that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
move around at all so that's all that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.800 
move around at all so that's all that
sets<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.200> about<00:03:10.419> just<00:03:11.419> for<00:03:11.659> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
sets and it's just about just for the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.789 
sets and it's just about just for the
center<00:03:12.079> gravity<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.530> fact<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:15.319> plane<00:03:15.530> flies

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
center gravity in fact the plane flies

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.969 
center gravity in fact the plane flies
perfectly<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:16.609> balanced<00:03:16.939> just<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.979> so

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979 
perfectly so it's balanced just right so

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.240 
perfectly so it's balanced just right so
that<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.400> how<00:03:19.639> a<00:03:20.000> battery<00:03:20.440> fits<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.680> there<00:03:21.889> okay

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
that is how a battery fits in there okay

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.199 
that is how a battery fits in there okay
and<00:03:22.690> when<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.720> want<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.930> take<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.199> out<00:03:24.319> just

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
and when you want to take it out just

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.409 
and when you want to take it out just
you<00:03:26.209> know<00:03:26.329> wiggle<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.900> little<00:03:26.989> bit<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:29.269> it

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
you know wiggle it a little bit and it

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.770 
you know wiggle it a little bit and it
should<00:03:31.840> holes<00:03:32.840> right<00:03:33.019> out<00:03:33.199> okay

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
should holes right out okay

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.849 
should holes right out okay
so<00:03:35.780> that's<00:03:35.959> how<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.109> sits<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.409> there<00:03:36.530> let<00:03:36.799> me

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
so that's how it sits in there let me

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.329 
so that's how it sits in there let me
know<00:03:36.979> if<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.129> get<00:03:37.220> any<00:03:37.340> questions<00:03:37.669> thanks
