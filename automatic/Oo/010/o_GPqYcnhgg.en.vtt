00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 salute all the games spaces are learned 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 white we are here today with a new one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.610
 episode of our career never gm su 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.980
 m2k 14 we left with two parts 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 we have seen intermezzo episodes 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.449
 how was the draft and how it went 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.580
 to take our quintet wall 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 bradley parker james m a quintet 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.920
 fantastic we switched to it one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.269
 team with the highest protection after 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.369
 to have been with the best 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 evaluation last year as a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.739
 summer can change everything 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.390
 we faced the holders of the lbl 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 chicago bulls that have already beaten 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 last year with training did not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.520
 complete this year we try again one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 game of chicago and the beginning is 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 balanced I have to say why the first one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 fourth was very very balanced 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 but then in the second quarter one digs a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530
 furrow thanks above all the defense 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.030
 we have a lebron james cain marcaria 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 we have already by pass that its best 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.199
 match in the league so far with 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.080
 thirty and passes points 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.180
 we have a marcus smart coming out of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 bench evil has not done so many 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 points but still a good presence 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.530
 defensive and rebounds ago we have to do 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.659
 tv the brands and therefore a quintet 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 fantastic that is very difficult to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.840
 stop then good first half of the race 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520
 because however you are dominated you are watching 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 a couple of actions that are not there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.530
 actions also very beautiful like this tap 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 in by john wall that goes to crush in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 middle of the area marked by several 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 people 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.979
 convincing the first half of the race since 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.229
 problemino instead in the second half 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.540
 now we're going to see the third quarter 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 that however, enough has been conducted 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 there was an amazing and already bari parker 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.520
 a fantastic player 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 I must say for those who downloaded the first one 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.079
 draft class by turris share 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.360
 you have noticed that the parks do not crush 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 I've hardly ever seen this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.320
 game that has had so many good 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.299
 occasions even alone but never has 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 dunk seems to project the ball 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.500
 board so this is enough 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 strange for a player because mba 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.619
 anyway go crush look here 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.380
 derrick roses he didn't want 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.030
 absolutely 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.540
 lose and guide the comeback of the chicago 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.520
 bulls in the fourth quarter 80 79 ball in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.890
 chicago and magda tv hand starts to play 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.440
 by god because he starts to score with 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.730
 regularity and chicago goes on 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.550
 fortunately my team is 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.840
 clearly superior and I can turn 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 this is Bari to my advantage then 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 I go to win in the end I wanted to talk to you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.050
 of this coin as we will go to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.720
 face the last period of life of 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.670
 anne v 2k 14 simple instead of making you 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 games for weeks I 'll bring you two 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.780
 bar three best games of the month 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.870
 culture where maybe just against the tops 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.670
 team like san antonio the lakers chicago 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.170
 bulls miami therefore only with remain i 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.760
 best I will play I will make you the highlights 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.050
 until you reach the playoffs which are the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.400
 our a video of this year because 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.830
 we absolutely have to win the title 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.760
 so stay tuned to this one 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.560
 modality 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 ok here the brawns placed because 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.860
 probably closes the game 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.330
 we will meet again soon if the truth is 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.860
 liked studying a comment sign up 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.670
 on the canal we will decide soon 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.670
