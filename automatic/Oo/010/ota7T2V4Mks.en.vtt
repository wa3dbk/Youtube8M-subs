let's<00:00:14.659> go<00:00:14.869> over<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.169> abilities<00:00:15.499> let's<00:00:15.740> start

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
let's go over the abilities let's start

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.370 
let's go over the abilities let's start
with<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.190> passive<00:00:16.840> as<00:00:17.840> you<00:00:17.960> can<00:00:18.080> see<00:00:18.230> she

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
with the passive as you can see she

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.960 
with the passive as you can see she
creates<00:00:18.650> these<00:00:18.770> weak<00:00:19.130> point<00:00:19.490> things<00:00:19.760> on

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
creates these weak point things on

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.790 
creates these weak point things on
people<00:00:20.150> like<00:00:20.420> that<00:00:20.480> no<00:00:20.900> directionally<00:00:21.590> based

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
people like that no directionally based

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.390 
people like that no directionally based
with<00:00:22.100> a<00:00:22.300> very<00:00:23.300> clear<00:00:23.570> indicator<00:00:24.280> appear<00:00:25.280> there

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
with a very clear indicator appear there

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.860 
with a very clear indicator appear there
if<00:00:25.490> yours<00:00:25.670> gonna<00:00:25.820> attack<00:00:26.290> it's<00:00:27.290> a<00:00:27.380> heel<00:00:27.620> spewed

if yours gonna attack it's a heel spewed

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.490 
if yours gonna attack it's a heel spewed
speed<00:00:29.870> boost<00:00:30.200> and<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:32.480> ideals<00:00:32.900> extra<00:00:33.290> true

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
speed boost and the ideals extra true

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.950 
speed boost and the ideals extra true
damage<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.520> just<00:00:35.060> to<00:00:35.150> kind<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.360> be<00:00:35.630> clear<00:00:35.870> about

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
damage so just to kind of be clear about

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.870 
damage so just to kind of be clear about
that<00:00:36.170> again<00:00:36.290> it's<00:00:36.650> positional<00:00:37.430> thing<00:00:37.610> see

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
that again it's positional thing see

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.520 
that again it's positional thing see
there's<00:00:38.090> one<00:00:38.120> here<00:00:38.600> you're<00:00:39.200> always<00:00:39.290> going<00:00:39.470> to

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
hit that reappear of all the way up here

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.819 
hit that reappear of all the way up here
just<00:00:43.100> go<00:00:43.489> around<00:00:44.020> now<00:00:45.020> I<00:00:45.290> find<00:00:45.649> that<00:00:45.770> quite

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
just go around now I find that quite

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.380 
just go around now I find that quite
curious<00:00:46.220> because<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.520> don't<00:00:46.700> know<00:00:46.820> why<00:00:47.060> maybe

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
curious because I don't know why maybe

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.569 
curious because I don't know why maybe
I'm<00:00:47.570> thinking<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> very<00:00:48.500> old<00:00:48.560> riot<00:00:48.980> post<00:00:49.340> or

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
I'm thinking of a very old riot post or

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.830 
I'm thinking of a very old riot post or
something<00:00:49.940> or<00:00:50.060> maybe<00:00:50.090> I'm<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.329> making<00:00:50.690> stuff

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
something or maybe I'm just making stuff

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.590 
something or maybe I'm just making stuff
up<00:00:50.899> but<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:51.140> thought<00:00:51.350> right<00:00:51.710> didn't<00:00:52.190> like

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
up but I thought right didn't like

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.450 
up but I thought right didn't like
positional<00:00:53.600> sort<00:00:53.870> of<00:00:53.960> based<00:00:54.399> sort<00:00:55.399> of

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
positional sort of based sort of

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.970 
positional sort of based sort of
conditional<00:00:55.910> stuff<00:00:56.090> like<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.300> like<00:00:56.660> um<00:00:56.980> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
conditional stuff like that like um the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.709 
conditional stuff like that like um the
only<00:00:58.010> real<00:00:58.489> other<00:00:58.700> examples<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.420> are<00:00:59.660> I

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
only real other examples of this are I

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.860 
only real other examples of this are I
think<00:00:59.899> off<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.559> top<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.829> my<00:01:00.950> head<00:01:01.010> tryndamere

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
think off the top of my head tryndamere

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.539 
think off the top of my head tryndamere
slow<00:01:02.870> thing<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:05.710> shake<00:01:06.710> owes<00:01:06.890> passive<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.520> I

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
slow thing and shake owes passive and I

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.590 
slow thing and shake owes passive and I
thought<00:01:07.760> they<00:01:07.880> were<00:01:07.970> trying<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:08.240> work<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:08.510> out

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
thought they were trying to work it out

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.910 
thought they were trying to work it out
of<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.780> game<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.020> i<00:01:09.080> guess<00:01:09.260> not<00:01:09.470> right<00:01:09.770> it's

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
of the game but i guess not right it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920 
of the game but i guess not right it's
cool<00:01:10.159> with<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.000> positional<00:01:11.479> stuff<00:01:11.690> because

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
cool with the positional stuff because

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.289 
cool with the positional stuff because
there's<00:01:12.170> here's<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.440> new<00:01:12.560> example<00:01:12.799> that<00:01:13.299> anyway

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
there's here's a new example that anyway

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.190 
there's here's a new example that anyway
let's<00:01:14.450> move<00:01:14.510> on<00:01:15.130> here's<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.220> lunge<00:01:17.200> appears

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
let's move on here's the lunge appears

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.190 
let's move on here's the lunge appears
to<00:01:18.320> be<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> skill-shot<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.250> sorts<00:01:23.049> it's<00:01:24.049> got<00:01:24.170> a

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
to be a skill-shot of sorts it's got a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.649 
to be a skill-shot of sorts it's got a
bunch<00:01:24.409> of<00:01:24.530> blesser<00:01:25.520> mechanics<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.299> on<00:01:26.450> with

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
bunch of blesser mechanics going on with

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.030 
bunch of blesser mechanics going on with
it<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:26.930> let's<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.260> read<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.560> over<00:01:27.650> real<00:01:27.860> quick

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.270 
that double dash thing it used to be
anymore<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.110> looks<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:45.439> it's<00:01:45.650> at<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.950> skill

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
anymore it looks like it's at the skill

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.399 
anymore it looks like it's at the skill
shot<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.880> interacts<00:01:47.540> with<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:48.110> know<00:01:48.200> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
shot that interacts with the you know a

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.649 
shot that interacts with the you know a
number<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.830> things<00:01:49.130> now<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:49.970> kind<00:01:50.570> of

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
number of things now so kind of

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.390 
number of things now so kind of
interesting<00:01:51.049> not<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.350> most<00:01:51.650> rework<00:01:52.100> scale

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
interesting not the most rework scale

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.060 
interesting not the most rework scale
ever<00:01:52.549> but<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.150> different<00:01:53.360> right<00:01:54.070> next

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
ever but it is different right next

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.340 
ever but it is different right next
let's<00:01:55.220> go<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.729> riposte<00:01:56.259> Harvard<00:01:57.259> like

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
let's go with the riposte Harvard like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.500 
let's go with the riposte Harvard like
to<00:01:57.439> pronounce

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.719 

so<00:02:07.510> it's<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:07.990> kind<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.729> directional

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
so it's now kind of like a directional

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.780 
so it's now kind of like a directional

thing<00:02:12.940> reminds<00:02:13.660> me<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.470> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
thing reminds me of you know I think a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.980 
thing reminds me of you know I think a
little<00:02:14.830> bit<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.459> guess<00:02:15.670> ions<00:02:16.090> charge<00:02:16.480> up<00:02:16.720> Q

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
little bit like I guess ions charge up Q

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.510 
little bit like I guess ions charge up Q
I<00:02:17.020> guess<00:02:17.260> that's<00:02:17.440> kind<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> idea<00:02:17.980> except

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
I guess that's kind of the idea except

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.940 
I guess that's kind of the idea except
your<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.720> absorb<00:02:20.080> damage<00:02:20.260> what's<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.830> on

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
your you absorb damage what's going on

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.230 
your you absorb damage what's going on

then counter stunned so that's kind of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.509 
then counter stunned so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:53.730> let's<00:02:54.730> go<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.239> blade<00:02:55.570> work<00:02:55.870> next

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
interesting let's go to blade work next

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.650 
interesting let's go to blade work next
let's<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.670> raise<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.000> off<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.239> us<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.510> go

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
let's just raise it off for us we go

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.449 
let's just raise it off for us we go
into<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> fewer<00:02:59.380> gains<00:02:59.680> increased<00:03:00.190> attack

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
into it fewer gains increased attack

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.490 
into it fewer gains increased attack
speed<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.880> our<00:03:01.030> next<00:03:01.300> two<00:03:01.450> basic<00:03:01.780> attacks<00:03:02.050> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
speed on our next two basic attacks the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.830 
speed on our next two basic attacks the
first<00:03:02.860> attack<00:03:03.190> cannot<00:03:03.700> crit<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.360> slows<00:03:04.660> your

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
first attack cannot crit but slows your

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.259 
first attack cannot crit but slows your
target<00:03:05.290> while<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.799> second<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.489> guaranteed

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
target while the second is a guaranteed

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.590 
target while the second is a guaranteed
crit<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.049> kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.680> interesting<00:03:12.600> did

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
crit so that's kind of interesting did

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.930 
crit so that's kind of interesting did
you<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:13.870> if<00:03:13.989> it's<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.170> big<00:03:14.350> quit<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.950> mean

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
you see if it's a big quit there I mean

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.550 
you see if it's a big quit there I mean
it's<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> most<00:03:16.540> complicated<00:03:16.989> skill<00:03:17.440> ever

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
it's not the most complicated skill ever

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.990 
it's not the most complicated skill ever
but<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.860> certainly<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> different<00:03:18.400> from<00:03:18.730> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
but it certainly is different from the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.960 
but it certainly is different from the
the<00:03:19.420> old<00:03:19.570> one<00:03:20.519> pneumatically<00:03:21.519> it's<00:03:21.760> similar

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
the old one pneumatically it's similar

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.000 
the old one pneumatically it's similar
though<00:03:22.150> alright<00:03:22.720> last<00:03:23.049> let's<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
had a chance to go off so if you kill

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.760 
had a chance to go off so if you kill
the<00:03:50.030> person<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.540> whole<00:03:50.570> healing<00:03:50.990> effect<00:03:51.380> goes

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
the person the whole healing effect goes

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.830 
the person the whole healing effect goes
off<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.970> let's<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.240> read<00:03:53.390> over<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> thing

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
off so let's just read over the thing

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.970 
off so let's just read over the thing
really<00:03:53.960> pick<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.290> we're<00:03:54.440> very<00:03:54.560> clear<00:03:54.860> as<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
really pick so we're very clear as to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.280 
really pick so we're very clear as to
what<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.220> does<00:03:55.390> fewer<00:03:56.390> targets<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.080> enemy

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290

way<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.650> saying<00:05:12.980> theme<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.700> don't<00:05:14.150> know<00:05:14.330> why<00:05:14.480> but

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
way of saying theme I don't know why but

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.590 
way of saying theme I don't know why but
why<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:14.990> know<00:05:15.080> why<00:05:15.320> but<00:05:15.590> anyway<00:05:16.520> someone<00:05:17.450> who

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
why I know why but anyway someone who

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.090 
why I know why but anyway someone who
wins<00:05:17.840> through<00:05:18.080> smarts<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.620> mechanical

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
wins through smarts and mechanical

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.340 
wins through smarts and mechanical
ability<00:05:19.430> rather<00:05:19.640> than<00:05:19.850> brute<00:05:20.180> numbers<00:05:20.660> so

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
ability rather than brute numbers so

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.480 
ability rather than brute numbers so
that's<00:05:21.530> always<00:05:21.680> kind<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:21.980> getting<00:05:22.220> at<00:05:22.340> there

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
that's always kind of getting at there

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.030 
that's always kind of getting at there
is<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.820> whole<00:05:23.230> your<00:05:24.230> was<00:05:24.500> essentially<00:05:24.980> a

is this whole your was essentially a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.000 
is this whole your was essentially a
very<00:05:25.370> kind<00:05:25.670> of<00:05:25.820> brute<00:05:26.600> force<00:05:26.930> your<00:05:27.350> master<00:05:27.830> alt

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
and then people die or they don't die

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.510 
and then people die or they don't die
kind<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:30.380> thing<00:05:30.530> depending<00:05:30.830> on<00:05:30.950> how<00:05:31.100> hard

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
kind of thing depending on how hard

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.540 
kind of thing depending on how hard
you'd<00:05:31.760> snowball<00:05:32.210> so<00:05:32.930> if<00:05:33.530> right<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:33.980> successful

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
you'd snowball so if right is successful

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.920 
you'd snowball so if right is successful
their<00:05:34.700> goals<00:05:34.910> and<00:05:35.060> just<00:05:35.240> kind<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.479> making<00:05:35.720> or

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
their goals and just kind of making or

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.700 
their goals and just kind of making or
more<00:05:36.200> of<00:05:36.229> a

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
more of a

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.160 
more of a
I<00:05:36.770> don't<00:05:37.310> know<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.400> tactical<00:05:38.060> player<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.600> suppose

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
I don't know a tactical player I suppose

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.830 
I don't know a tactical player I suppose
which<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:39.800> guess<00:05:40.240> mainly<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.450> lot<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.720> it's

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
which is I guess mainly a lot of it's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.210 
which is I guess mainly a lot of it's
going<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.050> come<00:05:42.170> from<00:05:42.230> this<00:05:42.500> whole<00:05:42.680> passive

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
going to come from this whole passive

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.530 
going to come from this whole passive
thing<00:05:43.460> here<00:05:43.700> we're<00:05:43.910> talking<00:05:44.030> about<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:44.420> kind

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
thing here we're talking about just kind

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.720 
thing here we're talking about just kind
of<00:05:44.570> moving<00:05:44.780> around<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.410> being<00:05:46.160> careful<00:05:46.430> about

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
of moving around and being careful about

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.510 
of moving around and being careful about
your<00:05:46.850> mechanics<00:05:47.920> definitely<00:05:48.920> create<00:05:49.280> sort<00:05:49.430> of

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
your mechanics definitely create sort of

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.210 
your mechanics definitely create sort of
this<00:05:49.640> uh<00:05:49.750> if<00:05:50.750> not<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:51.140> illusion<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.770> like<00:05:52.010> the

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
this uh if not the illusion of like the

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.000 
this uh if not the illusion of like the
you<00:05:52.490> know<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.790> very<00:05:52.940> least<00:05:53.030> or<00:05:53.570> rather<00:05:54.140> easier

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
you know the very least or rather easier

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.000 
you know the very least or rather easier
it<00:05:55.100> will<00:05:55.160> create<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.430> illusion<00:05:55.730> of<00:05:56.060> or<00:05:57.010> in

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
it will create the illusion of or in

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.740 
it will create the illusion of or in
fact<00:05:58.250> requires<00:05:58.670> sort<00:05:58.910> of<00:05:58.970> very<00:05:59.150> skilled<00:05:59.630> and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
fact requires sort of very skilled and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.210 
fact requires sort of very skilled and
precise<00:06:00.110> play<00:06:00.410> mostly<00:06:00.860> how<00:06:01.010> it<00:06:01.100> actually

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
precise play mostly how it actually

style<00:06:28.760> kind<00:06:28.910> of<00:06:29.030> thing<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:29.660> you<00:06:29.780> know<00:06:29.840> I'll

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930

incidentally<00:06:33.890> fewer<00:06:34.220> was<00:06:34.490> actually<00:06:34.970> the

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
incidentally fewer was actually the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.590 
incidentally fewer was actually the
first<00:06:36.400> unreleased<00:06:37.400> champion<00:06:37.970> i<00:06:38.030> purchased

first unreleased champion i purchased

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.080 
first unreleased champion i purchased
and<00:06:39.290> i<00:06:39.560> really<00:06:39.920> didn't<00:06:40.130> like<00:06:40.280> her<00:06:40.490> so<00:06:40.700> that<00:06:40.970> was

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
and i really didn't like her so that was

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.010 
and i really didn't like her so that was
unfortunate<00:06:41.390> but<00:06:42.200> anyway<00:06:42.590> uh<00:06:43.240> yeah<00:06:44.240> i<00:06:44.570> hope

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
unfortunate but anyway uh yeah i hope
