00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 best 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.050
 luckily we were not the five to bruno 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.260

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.260

 d 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.820
 organization supported but I already know 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.620
 presents 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.710
 what will happen to the competitions 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.700
 oxxo the players were committed 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.170
 everything is transferred to and on a new 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.410
 the problem also tell us a little 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.410

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.060
 the competition that are each we have 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.060
 taste 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.610
 very clear 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.430
 we think playing them clearly we're going to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.060
 play as if alone 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 I guess not 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.730
 good player esteem that sure 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.850
 although it is not so that the realities and 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.010
 feeling in three lawsuits and solos 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.010

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.340
 to mention what reality is 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.310
 obviously the reality existed so 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.860
