00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
you want to focus on and yeah that's

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420 
you want to focus on and yeah that's
basically<00:02:28.810> obviously<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.219> go<00:02:30.370> to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
basically obviously you can go to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
you want but to be honest I think it's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
you want but to be honest I think it's
very<00:02:37.629> easy<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.019> use<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.560> as<00:02:38.769> long<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.159> you<00:02:39.219> keep

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
very easy to use and as long as you keep

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.789 
very easy to use and as long as you keep
it<00:02:39.549> at<00:02:39.639> the<00:02:39.760> highest<00:02:39.969> quality<00:02:40.389> you<00:02:40.659> know<00:02:41.290> every

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
it at the highest quality you know every

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.390 
it at the highest quality you know every
everything<00:02:42.609> is<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:42.879> look<00:02:42.939> fine<00:02:43.269> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
everything is going to look fine and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
everything is going to look fine and
then<00:02:45.400> yeah<00:02:45.849> that's<00:02:46.150> basically<00:02:46.359> it<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
then yeah that's basically it for the
