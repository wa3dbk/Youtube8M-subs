this<00:00:11.320> video<00:00:11.680> concerns<00:00:12.309> reversing<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.389> shaft

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
this video concerns reversing the shaft

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.530 
this video concerns reversing the shaft
on<00:00:13.990> an<00:00:14.379> e<00:00:14.620> flight<00:00:14.950> power<00:00:15.849> 10<00:00:16.529> electric<00:00:17.529> motor

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
on an e flight power 10 electric motor

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.240 
on an e flight power 10 electric motor
this<00:00:19.540> motor<00:00:19.779> is<00:00:19.960> going<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.259> go<00:00:20.410> into<00:00:20.710> a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
this motor is going to go into a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.029 
this motor is going to go into a
multiplex<00:00:21.939> aircraft<00:00:22.450> and<00:00:22.840> they<00:00:23.380> require<00:00:23.800> the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
multiplex aircraft and they require the

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.029 
multiplex aircraft and they require the
shaft<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:25.180> stick<00:00:25.450> out<00:00:25.630> basically<00:00:26.380> what<00:00:26.949> would

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
shaft to stick out basically what would

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.589 
shaft to stick out basically what would
be<00:00:27.160> considered<00:00:27.279> I<00:00:27.699> guess<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.029> back<00:00:28.269> end<00:00:28.510> of

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
be considered I guess the back end of

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.650 
be considered I guess the back end of
the<00:00:28.689> motor<00:00:28.900> so<00:00:29.679> that<00:00:29.710> it<00:00:29.920> came<00:00:30.070> out<00:00:30.160> in<00:00:30.400> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the motor so that it came out in the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.119 
the motor so that it came out in the
mounting<00:00:31.660> plate<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.080> holds<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.439> in<00:00:32.500> place<00:00:32.650> so

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.950 

so<00:00:36.129> we're<00:00:36.280> going<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.430> go<00:00:36.550> ahead<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:36.960> reverse

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
so we're going to go ahead and reverse

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.130 
so we're going to go ahead and reverse
this<00:00:38.170> shaft<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:40.180> first<00:00:40.449> thing<00:00:40.600> we<00:00:40.690> need<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.900> do

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
this shaft so first thing we need to do

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.950 
this shaft so first thing we need to do
is<00:00:41.580> take<00:00:42.580> a<00:00:42.640> one<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.059> half<00:00:43.089> millimeter<00:00:43.720> and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
is take a one and a half millimeter and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.799 
is take a one and a half millimeter and
e-flite<00:00:44.680> actually<00:00:45.129> makes<00:00:45.339> a<00:00:45.640> wrench<00:00:46.449> for<00:00:46.540> this

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
e-flite actually makes a wrench for this

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.430 
e-flite actually makes a wrench for this
although<00:00:47.559> don't<00:00:47.920> try<00:00:48.190> this<00:00:48.250> wrench<00:00:48.699> on<00:00:48.970> there

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
although don't try this wrench on there

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.890 
although don't try this wrench on there
for<00:00:50.440> 80<00:00:50.650> series<00:00:51.040> motors<00:00:51.549> it<00:00:51.790> doesn't<00:00:52.420> fit

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
for 80 series motors it doesn't fit

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.049 
for 80 series motors it doesn't fit
that's<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:54.390> 0.05<00:00:55.979> 0.05<00:00:56.979> 0<00:00:57.970> inch<00:00:59.129> okay<00:01:00.159> allen

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
that's a 0.05 0.05 0 inch okay allen

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.920 
that's a 0.05 0.05 0 inch okay allen
wrench<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:01.659> but<00:01:02.650> on<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.640> motor<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.119> who

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
wrench so but on this motor and who

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.600 
wrench so but on this motor and who
knows<00:01:05.110> how<00:01:05.260> many<00:01:05.320> others<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.010> efj<00:01:06.340> light

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
knows how many others this efj light

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.330 
knows how many others this efj light
wrench<00:01:06.880> does<00:01:07.180> or<00:01:07.420> does<00:01:07.780> work<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.159> first

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
wrench does or does work so the first

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.270 
wrench does or does work so the first
thing<00:01:09.520> we<00:01:09.610> need<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.790> do<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.830> need<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:11.920> loosen

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
thing we need to do is need to loosen

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.429 
thing we need to do is need to loosen
these<00:01:12.430> two<00:01:14.520> grub<00:01:15.520> screws<00:01:15.789> here<00:01:16.200> I'll<00:01:17.200> go<00:01:17.350> ahead

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
these two grub screws here I'll go ahead

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.349 
these two grub screws here I'll go ahead
and<00:01:17.590> do<00:01:17.679> that<00:01:19.740> pretty<00:01:20.740> straightforward

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
and do that pretty straightforward

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:28.219 
and do that pretty straightforward
hopefully<00:01:22.359> that<00:01:22.539> they're<00:01:22.899> not<00:01:23.079> stripped<00:01:26.939> less

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hopefully that they're not stripped less

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.529 
hopefully that they're not stripped less
and<00:01:29.229> there<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:29.770> go

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
and there we go

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.319 
and there we go
takes<00:01:31.539> just<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.929> little<00:01:32.170> bit<00:01:32.289> effort<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
takes just a little bit effort the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.139 
takes just a little bit effort the
wrench<00:01:34.539> out<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.899> there<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.490> we'll<00:01:36.820> do<00:01:36.999> the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
wrench out of there and we'll do the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:48.800 
wrench out of there and we'll do the
second<00:01:37.570> one

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.450 

all<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.649> those<00:01:49.950> should<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.250> clear<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:52.460> then

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
all right those should be clear and then

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
all right those should be clear and then
on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.880> end<00:01:54.180> there's<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.200> collet

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
on the back end there's this collet

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.639 
on the back end there's this collet
alright<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.539> this<00:01:57.720> call<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.079> needs<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.470> be

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
alright and so this call it needs to be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
alright and so this call it needs to be
loosened<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.250> stay<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.970> end

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
loosened up and it will stay on this end

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999 
loosened up and it will stay on this end
of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> engine<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.320> basically<00:02:04.740> what

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
of the engine this is basically what

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
of the engine this is basically what
keeps<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.580> pulling<00:02:06.539> apart<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.690> ahead

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
keeps it from pulling apart so go ahead

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.729 
keeps it from pulling apart so go ahead
and<00:02:09.899> loosen<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.530> set<00:02:10.830> screw<00:02:12.200> very<00:02:13.200> good

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and loosen that set screw very good

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.699 
and loosen that set screw very good
so<00:02:14.160> much<00:02:14.340> better<00:02:14.640> than<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.620> 480<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> had

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
so much better than the 480 that I had

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.570 
so much better than the 480 that I had
and<00:02:19.709> let's<00:02:20.489> see<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.600> yep<00:02:22.519> it's<00:02:23.519> pretty

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and let's see we can yep it's pretty

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.080 
and let's see we can yep it's pretty
tight<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:28.310> should<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.459> able<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:29.880> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
tight on here should be able to get that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.220 
tight on here should be able to get that
right<00:02:30.299> off<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.660> looks<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.049> it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
right off of there it looks like it's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.339 
right off of there it looks like it's
probably<00:02:34.470> got<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:36.150> thread<00:02:36.480> compound<00:02:37.110> or

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
probably got some thread compound or

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.300 
probably got some thread compound or
something<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:39.630> here<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.560> causing<00:02:40.950> this

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
something in here that's causing this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.509 
something in here that's causing this
thing<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> stick<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.040> bear<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.069> me

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
thing to want to stick so bear with me

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.699 
thing to want to stick so bear with me
while<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.299> out<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> your<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.290> but

cool<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:04.049> one<00:03:04.680> thing<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.950> watch<00:03:05.100> out<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.340> on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
cool so one thing to watch out for on

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.410 
cool so one thing to watch out for on
these<00:03:05.819> e<00:03:05.850> flight<00:03:06.209> motors<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.690

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
they do have a little split ring kind of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.720 
they do have a little split ring kind of
washer<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:17.430> kind<00:03:17.670> of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
washer in here and it it's kind of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
washer in here and it it's kind of
important<00:03:18.239> not<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.540> lose<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.750> let's<00:03:22.470> get

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
important not to lose this so let's get

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.009 
important not to lose this so let's get
this<00:03:22.799> one<00:03:22.859> off<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.370> here<00:03:23.549> set<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.209> aside<00:03:24.389> so<00:03:24.630> we

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
this one off of here set it aside so we

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.540 
this one off of here set it aside so we
definitely<00:03:25.170> don't<00:03:25.560> lose<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:27.410> there

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.500 

and<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.800> in<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.860> previous<00:03:34.520> video<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.000> can<00:03:35.330> kind

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510

and so in a previous video you can kind
of<00:03:35.600> see<00:03:35.870> what<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.530> thing<00:03:36.800> looks<00:03:36.830> like<00:03:37.160> it's

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
of see what this thing looks like it's

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.680 
of see what this thing looks like it's
pretty<00:03:37.700> small<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.410> set<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:39.740> aside<00:03:40.510> now<00:03:41.510> we're

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
pretty small so set that aside now we're

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.850 
pretty small so set that aside now we're
ready<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.960> go<00:03:42.230> ahead<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.740> impress<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.820> motor

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
ready to go ahead and impress this motor

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
screws at the back end and you're

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.200 
screws at the back end and you're
finished<00:05:28.120> it's<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.930> simple<00:05:29.229> and<00:05:30.000> there<00:05:31.000> and

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
so if you ever have to reverse the shaft

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.390 
so if you ever have to reverse the shaft
on<00:05:33.699> one<00:05:33.849> of<00:05:33.880> these<00:05:34.000> motors<00:05:35.190> it's<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> pretty

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
on one of these motors it's a pretty

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.150 
on one of these motors it's a pretty
simple<00:05:36.930> straightforward<00:05:37.930> process<00:05:38.470> nothing

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
simple straightforward process nothing

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.059
