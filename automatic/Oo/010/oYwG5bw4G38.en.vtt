00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 of course what happened yesterday 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 match between the rivers of ruby in the formidable 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.870
 now everyone is talking and of course this is not 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.269
 right if even so calm 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.679
 man as Vasily utkin this brought 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.529
 from yourself what is already talking about simple 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.270
 fans 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 everyone here sees this a bit 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 negative in what happened to me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.420
 it seems that yesterday was laid such 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.420
 nice new tradition 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 team leader talk 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.309
 head of the republic there area 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.260
 province handsfree with fans 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 judges immediately know such a direct 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 addressed to the people in one way or since 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
 people of the guests of the city and, in principle, I 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.899
 I think Russian Versailles should 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 allow the quality of the experiment to the end 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 seasons in terrible conduct such here 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 hands-free conversations and I think that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 This can himself Ramzan Kadyrov do 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.610
 every match can almost be someone 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.199
 of his assistants do if there 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 communication engineer here's a young guy 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.160
 says said there is also something if 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 there really is such a person 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.850
 can you give him a try to say 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.439
 anything at all anyone needs 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.460
 develop battery who will today 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 speak for example a judge over the radio node 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 there I want to say that in principle on 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.630
 project because he is more than something 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.580
 stimulates during the match in western 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.009
 countries even home teams mostly 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 cheers supports i think that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.070
 such a new trend yesterday palop 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.390
 It is supposed to be such a good tradition to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.670
 to encourage a judge for example 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.350
 Here in the formidable if there is a game next 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 if the judge is not very compatible 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 good in terms of leadership 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 Television commands, then you can tell me again 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.899
 that here we have in the past last game 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 there was a sales you there even worse there 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.439
 bought a number to call him 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 and if for example you will delete the player 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.939
 teams of the opponent there the turn is possible 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.920
 tell them that here is our dear 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.570
 especially for you here now sings 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.149
 Stas Mihailov for example 1 game 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 it came out mihailov sang that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.760
 for you there is not any there on foot 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.940
 principle can 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.400
 Pour mate because ramzan 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.280
 Kadyrov can afford none and 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.170
 other as they were together and separately 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.420
 Well, that is, as it were, in principle, a game like that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.760
 go more fun you know well i think that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.830
 it's okay seriously 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.510
 I wanted to say such a thing as if from 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.990
 you as a fan as a person 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.000
 who is 30 years old love football 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.280
 sick in what i'm heading fan 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.740
 not team anzhi Makhachkala disease 110 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.810
 csk but now it has like some 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 meanings just i want to say what if 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 half a year ago on in this city 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.930
 when events did not occur 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 acceptable to the local leadership 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.820
 leadership team for that billy then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.680
 today they are just being insulted by radio 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.570
 that is, there is already a tendency to 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.210
 better tomorrow means can already 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.630
 be some kind of conversation after the game and in 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.459
 Basically, I think that Ramzan Kadyrov too 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.950
 must understand that such things are not 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.420
 being made in principle we of course don't care 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.190
 to my opinion as to the opinion of many 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.070
 other people probably just i don't care 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.920
 and you tell the most important thing that no one 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.410
 they killed very well that no one was beaten 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 and it's great that the war did not happen and there were 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.140
 hope that such things are played 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.140
 repeat not
