intro and has been several changes to
this<00:00:36.770> trusty<00:00:37.580> steam<00:00:37.879> but<00:00:38.809> things<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:39.320> went

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
this trusty steam but things we went

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.799 
this trusty steam but things we went
after<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:39.890> year<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:41.239> engine

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
after this year was the engine

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.979 
after this year was the engine
performance<00:00:42.400> light<00:00:43.400> weight<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:44.360> improved

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
performance light weight and improved

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.950 
performance light weight and improved
handling<00:00:48.820> on<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.970> engine<00:00:50.300> performance<00:00:50.390> we

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
handling on the engine performance we

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.170 
handling on the engine performance we
changed<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.440> muffler<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.830> little<00:00:52.129> bit<00:00:52.280> which

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
changed the muffler a little bit which

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.030 
changed the muffler a little bit which
gave<00:00:53.420> us<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.690> little<00:00:53.870> more<00:00:54.050> mid<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.800> top

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
gave us a little more mid to top

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.000 
gave us a little more mid to top
horsepower<00:00:55.730> as<00:00:56.059> well<00:00:56.870> as<00:00:57.080> some<00:00:57.320> changes<00:00:57.890> in

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
horsepower as well as some changes in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.700 
horsepower as well as some changes in
the<00:00:58.100> carburetor<00:00:58.540> ignition<00:00:59.540> and<00:01:00.079> we've<00:01:00.500> also

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
the carburetor ignition and we've also

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.979 
the carburetor ignition and we've also
put<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.070> forty<00:01:01.430> nine<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.910> sprocket<00:01:02.540> on<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.809> rear

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
put a forty nine to sprocket on the rear

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.229 
put a forty nine to sprocket on the rear
last<00:01:03.350> year<00:01:03.559> was<00:01:03.680> 48<00:01:03.950> we<00:01:04.430> found<00:01:04.699> most<00:01:05.000> guys

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
last year was 48 we found most guys

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.900 
last year was 48 we found most guys
preferred<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.410> 49<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.280> we've<00:01:07.430> kind<00:01:07.820> of

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
preferred the 49 so we've kind of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.400 
preferred the 49 so we've kind of
already<00:01:08.060> did<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.450> addition<00:01:08.869> for<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.229> guys

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
already did that addition for you guys

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.710 
already did that addition for you guys
and<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.490> seems<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.910> match<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.450> engine

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
and that seems to match the engine

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.210 
and that seems to match the engine
character<00:01:12.110> really<00:01:12.350> well<00:01:12.500> gets<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:12.950> out<00:01:13.039> of<00:01:13.160> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
character really well gets it out of the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.310 
character really well gets it out of the
turns<00:01:13.490> real<00:01:13.850> quick<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.479> then<00:01:14.720> with<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.990> added

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
turns real quick and then with the added

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.889 
turns real quick and then with the added
mid<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.680> top<00:01:15.860> makes<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> engine<00:01:16.700> really<00:01:17.000> long

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.719 

the<00:01:20.899> front<00:01:21.200> brake<00:01:21.410> too<00:01:21.920> much<00:01:22.130> lighter<00:01:22.460> it's

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
the front brake too much lighter it's

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.290 
the front brake too much lighter it's
exclusive<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.570> 250f<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.580> lot<00:01:26.149> of

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
exclusive to the 250f we have a lot of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.120 
exclusive to the 250f we have a lot of
changes<00:01:26.780> not<00:01:26.960> just<00:01:27.020> lightweight<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.039> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
changes not just lightweight but in the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.609 
changes not just lightweight but in the
piston<00:01:28.550> size<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.600> makeup<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.440> lower

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
piston size and the makeup of the lower

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.309 
piston size and the makeup of the lower
caliper<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.520> went<00:01:31.849> from<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.149> cast<00:01:32.420> piece<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.110> a

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
caliper it went from a cast piece to a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.410 
caliper it went from a cast piece to a
forge<00:01:33.830> piece<00:01:34.190> giving<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> lot<00:01:35.209> more

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
forge piece giving it a lot more

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.949 
forge piece giving it a lot more
strength<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.950> performance<00:01:37.940> increase<00:01:38.390> so

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
strength and the performance increase so

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.680 
strength and the performance increase so
we've<00:01:39.319> taken<00:01:39.950> over<00:01:40.099> 3<00:01:40.429> pounds<00:01:40.670> off<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.179> o7

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
we've taken over 3 pounds off the o7

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.230 
we've taken over 3 pounds off the o7
yz250<00:01:42.259> off<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.830> lot<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.490> weight<00:01:43.700> was<00:01:43.849> taken

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
yz250 off a lot of that weight was taken

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.089 
yz250 off a lot of that weight was taken
off<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.390> front<00:01:44.780> end<00:01:44.990> with<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.470> different<00:01:45.950> outer

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
off the front end with a different outer

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.609 
off the front end with a different outer
tube<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:47.119> front<00:01:47.509> brake<00:01:47.720> as<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:48.050> mentioned

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
tube and front brake as I mentioned

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.020 
tube and front brake as I mentioned
triple<00:01:49.459> clamp<00:01:49.729> some<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.300> bolts<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:51.349> a<00:01:52.340> lot

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
triple clamp some of the bolts so a lot

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.880 
triple clamp some of the bolts so a lot
of<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.390> three<00:01:53.660> pounds<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.259> taken<00:01:54.619> off<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
of that three pounds is taken off the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.620 
of that three pounds is taken off the
front<00:01:55.190> which<00:01:55.399> really<00:01:55.729> helped<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.209> handling

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
front which really helped the handling

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.059 
front which really helped the handling
of<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> bike<00:01:57.050> gives<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.440> lot<00:01:57.649> light<00:01:57.890> of

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
of the bike gives a lot light of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.249 
of the bike gives a lot light of
steering<00:01:58.459> feeling<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:59.090> lot<00:01:59.390> more<00:01:59.450> nimble<00:01:59.989> more

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
steering feeling a lot more nimble more

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.559 
steering feeling a lot more nimble more
agile<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.550> all<00:02:01.700> sounds<00:02:02.060> great<00:02:02.209> but<00:02:02.360> what

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
agile that all sounds great but what

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.449 
agile that all sounds great but what
that<00:02:02.690> really<00:02:02.929> means<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.679> track<00:02:03.950> you

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
that really means is on the track you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.219 
that really means is on the track you
get<00:02:04.640> into<00:02:04.849> the<00:02:04.970> turns<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.420> better<00:02:05.690> and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
get into the turns a little better and

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.230 
get into the turns a little better and
you<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.619> stay<00:02:06.890> in<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:07.250> turn<00:02:07.489> better

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
you can stay in that turn better

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.120 
you can stay in that turn better

you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.670> we've<00:02:11.880> also<00:02:12.380> moved<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.740> head<00:02:14.010> tube

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
you know we've also moved the head tube

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250 
you know we've also moved the head tube
the<00:02:14.880> frame<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.390> three<00:02:15.660> millimeters<00:02:15.870> shorter

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the frame is three millimeters shorter

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.680 
the frame is three millimeters shorter
so<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.250> does<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> few<00:02:17.700> things<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.240> helps<00:02:18.480> put<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so it does a few things that helps put a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.660 
so it does a few things that helps put a
little<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:19.050> weight<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> front<00:02:19.530> end<00:02:19.950> give

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
little more weight on the front end give

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.970 
little more weight on the front end give
me<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:20.970> more<00:02:21.150> bite<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.140> as<00:02:22.500> well<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.950> just

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
me one more bite and as well as just

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.310 
me one more bite and as well as just
shortening<00:02:23.610> up<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> overall<00:02:24.360> length<00:02:24.630> it's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
shortening up the overall length it's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.050 
shortening up the overall length it's
got<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> one<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> half<00:02:26.070> millimeter<00:02:26.640> longer

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
got a one and a half millimeter longer

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.210 
got a one and a half millimeter longer
rear<00:02:27.240> shock<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:28.200> helps<00:02:28.560> deepen<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
rear shock just helps deepen up that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
rear shock just helps deepen up that
pork<00:02:29.520> angle<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.390> give<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.930> more

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
pork angle just to give it a little more

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.470 
pork angle just to give it a little more
agile<00:02:31.710> feeling<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> turns

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.940 

so<00:02:38.480> we've<00:02:38.690> taken<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.200> engine<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.800> we've

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
so we've taken the engine and we've

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.640 
so we've taken the engine and we've
rotated<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.209> get<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.750> cylinder<00:02:42.200> head<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
rotated it to get the cylinder head a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.470 
rotated it to get the cylinder head a
little<00:02:42.800> bit<00:02:42.950> more<00:02:43.190> upright<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.940> did<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.270> on

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
little bit more upright we did this on

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.410 
little bit more upright we did this on
the<00:02:44.630> 450<00:02:45.140> last<00:02:45.950> year<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> really<00:02:47.090> helped

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the 450 last year and it really helped

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.300 
the 450 last year and it really helped
to<00:02:47.510> centralize<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.290> mass<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.950> gives<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
to centralize the mass and it gives the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.430 
to centralize the mass and it gives the
overall<00:02:49.490> bike<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> lighter<00:02:50.540> feeling<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.290> all

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
overall bike a lighter feeling in all

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:11.660 
overall bike a lighter feeling in all
directions

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:30.910
