00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
 Since Volvo launched its hybrid truck in March 2011- 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.040
 - About 50 trucks have been delivered to customers all over Europe. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.000
 Roteb, with more than 6,000 employees, is Rotterdam's largest employer 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.720
 - specializes in waste management and street cleaning. 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.000
 Two years ago they bought Volvo's hybrid trucks - 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 -to be able to live up to their own and the city's environmental policy. 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.360
 It runs really well. It's quiet. It's perfect. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 It is fully automatic. I just have to start the engine. 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 I put it in "drive" and then it runs. The rest is automatic. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.680
 If you want to continue using electricity, press a button. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 Then it uses electricity. If you want diesel, you press "diesel". 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.760
 One should not do anything else. It lets itself up. It's easy. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.800
 Two experts have been appointed to assist engineers in workshops - 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.200
 - on a market that has problems with hybrid transmission. 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 They have not been busy, because the trucks have proved to be just as reliable - 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.640
 - like any other Volvo truck. 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.680
 It works like a regular truck. 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.080
 You save a lot of fuel and it doesn't sound so much. 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.280
 It fits into everyday life. 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 Utility time is normal. It is the same as other trucks. 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.120
 It is no different in use. It's like the other trucks. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.960
 The truck reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 20%. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.000
 With an electric grinder, the reduction is up to 30%. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.080
 Depending on the use it can run short distances silently- 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.280
 -and without discharge with up to 50 km / h.- 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.560
 - all with his electric motor. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.520
 When making deceleration, energy is stored in the battery. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.040
 The energy can be used for acceleration. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 Therefore, transport tasks such as waste management or urban driving 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.200
 - very suitable. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.160
 If you also install an electric grinder on the hybrid chassis 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.720
 - you have a truck that optimizes fuel savings. 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.360
 It is very quiet. I often get compliments from people in the street. 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.120
 They ask if it is electric and I tell you it is. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.240
 Then they turn their thumbs up. 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.480
 People are surprised that it is so quiet and they smile. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.680
 They are happy that such a large truck is electric. They like it. 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.280
 I think hybrid technology is promising for the future. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.440
 It has revolutionized fuel and emission savings. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.880
 We cannot afford not to further explore this field. 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 That's something we want to do.
