in<00:00:25.460> core<00:00:25.670> clean<00:00:25.910> system<00:00:26.180> there's<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.960> valve<00:00:27.290> and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
in core clean system there's a valve and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.800 
in core clean system there's a valve and
the<00:00:27.980> water<00:00:28.010> comes<00:00:28.490> into<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:28.759> valve<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:29.330> then

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
the water comes into the valve and then

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.160 
the water comes into the valve and then
at<00:00:30.110> intervals<00:00:31.040> it's<00:00:31.340> circulated<00:00:32.329> out<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.780> six

you'd always go for the bottom up it's
way<00:01:35.540> more<00:01:35.570> efficient<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:36.710> when<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:36.860> pool<00:01:37.100> is

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189

from<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.259> bottom<00:01:42.590> you're<00:01:43.009> heating<00:01:43.219> and<00:01:43.549> the

from the bottom you're heating and the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.950 
from the bottom you're heating and the
heat<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.969> rising<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.540> get<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.719> nice

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
heat is rising and you get a nice

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.780 
heat is rising and you get a nice
uniform<00:01:45.290> temperature<00:01:45.890> throughout<00:01:46.219> and<00:01:46.399> it

uniform temperature throughout and it

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.840 
uniform temperature throughout and it
certainly<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.420> efficient
