00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
right here well this one right here is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.180 
right here well this one right here is
more<00:01:22.420> pink<00:01:24.160> there<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.220> go<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:26.000> like<00:01:26.240> that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
so it's like a pale pink and when she

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.300

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
deep purple and the pink because this is
