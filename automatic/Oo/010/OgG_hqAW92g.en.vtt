a<00:00:05.920> tornado<00:00:06.910> is<00:00:07.270> the<00:00:07.420> most<00:00:07.600> volatile<00:00:08.230> of<00:00:08.500> these

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770 
a tornado is the most volatile of these

a tornado is the most volatile of these

in the Midwest of America a region known

in the Midwest of America a region known
as<00:00:18.310> Tornado<00:00:19.000> Alley

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:35.050 

come<00:00:23.529> on

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.200 

but<00:00:35.630> despite<00:00:36.020> its<00:00:36.530> violence<00:00:37.010> at<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.760> core<00:00:38.180> of

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
but despite its violence at the core of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.100 
but despite its violence at the core of
a<00:00:38.420> tornado<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.260> very<00:00:39.830> simple<00:00:40.220> process

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:54.090 

I<00:00:43.370> just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.700 

at<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.850> tornados<00:00:55.449> core<00:00:55.809> is<00:00:56.050> an<00:00:56.260> area<00:00:56.680> of

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
at the tornados core is an area of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.369 
at the tornados core is an area of
intense<00:00:56.920> low<00:00:57.789> pressure<00:00:58.149> which<00:00:58.989> draws

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
intense low pressure which draws

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.740 
intense low pressure which draws
high-pressure<00:01:00.160> air<00:01:00.460> towards<00:01:01.120> it

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
high-pressure air towards it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.020 
high-pressure air towards it
the<00:01:03.290> dust<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.830> debris<00:01:04.010> picked<00:01:04.610> up<00:01:04.820> by<00:01:04.970> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
the dust and debris picked up by the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.750 
the dust and debris picked up by the
tornado<00:01:05.390> reveal<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.560> swirling<00:01:07.250> pattern<00:01:07.640> of

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
tornado reveal the swirling pattern of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
tornado reveal the swirling pattern of
winds

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.380 

so<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.520> high<00:01:31.729> pressure<00:01:32.060> is

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
so this is it the high pressure is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980 
so this is it the high pressure is
swirling<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.080> was<00:01:33.260> an<00:01:33.470> up<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.190> funnel<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.990> hit

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
swirling it was an up that funnel I hit

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.150 
swirling it was an up that funnel I hit
enormous

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.890 

no<00:01:40.160> idea<00:01:40.580> Big<00:01:42.160> it's<00:01:43.160> just<00:01:43.370> amazing<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.150> here

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
no idea Big it's just amazing and here

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.520 
no idea Big it's just amazing and here
it's<00:01:45.050> almost<00:01:45.320> calm<00:01:45.790> but<00:01:46.790> over<00:01:47.060> there<00:01:47.530> those

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's almost calm but over there those

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.550 
it's almost calm but over there those
winds<00:01:48.980> ago<00:01:49.160> hundreds<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.940> miles<00:01:50.120> an<00:01:50.360> hour

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
winds ago hundreds of miles an hour

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.260 
winds ago hundreds of miles an hour
pushing<00:01:51.560> stuff<00:01:51.830> right<00:01:52.370> up<00:01:52.610> into<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.910> heart<00:01:53.150> of

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
pushing stuff right up into the heart of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.530 
pushing stuff right up into the heart of
the<00:01:53.360> storm<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:54.550> just<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:55.700> can't<00:01:55.970> stop<00:01:56.180> looking<00:01:56.330> at

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
the storm I just I can't stop looking at

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.000 
the storm I just I can't stop looking at
it<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.810> incredible

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010
