it's not as grippy from the sides but it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's not as grippy from the sides but it
still<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:38.219> provide<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:39.180> protection<00:00:39.540> I

adjust the focus ok there you go the
cutouts<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.989> perfect<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> microphone

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cutouts are perfect for the microphone

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
cutouts are perfect for the microphone
for<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> camera<00:01:06.979> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.580> microphone

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
for the camera for the other microphone

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.770 
for the camera for the other microphone
in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> micro<00:01:10.080> USB<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:12.360> volume<00:01:12.570> rocker

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
in the micro USB and the volume rocker

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
in the micro USB and the volume rocker
as<00:01:13.290> well<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:16.130> everything<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.610> perfect

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
as well and everything there's perfect

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
as well and everything there's perfect
cutouts<00:01:18.409> there's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> slight<00:01:19.860> lip<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> top

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
cutouts there's a slight lip on the top

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
cutouts there's a slight lip on the top
so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> protect<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> falls

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so it's going to protect it if it falls

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.289 
so it's going to protect it if it falls
from<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.890> angle<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.439> even<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:26.180> even<00:01:27.180> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
from that angle and even from even on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.800 
from that angle and even from even on
the<00:01:27.420> sides<00:01:27.860> if<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.310> falls<00:01:29.759> directly<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the sides if it falls directly on the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
the sides if it falls directly on the
top<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.740> I'll<00:01:31.890> still<00:01:32.280> protect<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
top I think I'll still protect it to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.100 
top I think I'll still protect it to
some<00:01:33.450> degree<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> be

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
some degree but if this is going to be

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050 
some degree but if this is going to be
freak<00:01:37.380> accidents<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> case<00:01:38.640> because

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
freak accidents with this case because

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.080 
freak accidents with this case because
it<00:01:39.240> does<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> way<00:01:40.259> around<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
it does not go all the way around and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
it does not go all the way around and
there's<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.840> freak<00:01:43.170> accidents

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
there's there can be freak accidents

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.810 
there's there can be freak accidents
with<00:01:43.920> any<00:01:44.100> case<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> believe<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:47.340> provides

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
with any case but I believe it provides

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
with any case but I believe it provides
a<00:01:47.970> premium<00:01:48.420> feeling<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.350> subtract

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
a premium feeling it doesn't subtract

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.200 
a premium feeling it doesn't subtract
from<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> phone<00:01:50.790> too<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:54.000> can

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
from the phone too much and the you can

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
from the phone too much and the you can
still<00:01:54.479> access<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:55.020> buttons<00:01:55.380> very<00:01:56.340> easily

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
still access your buttons very easily

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.010 
still access your buttons very easily
and

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.730 
and
it's<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.649> very<00:01:59.890> minimalistic<00:02:00.430> case<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:02.380> is

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
it's a very minimalistic case that is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.789 
it's a very minimalistic case that is
pretty<00:02:03.219> good<00:02:03.429> I<00:02:04.049> can't<00:02:05.049> say<00:02:05.259> it's<00:02:05.439> going<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.649> be

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
pretty good I can't say it's going to be

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.469 
pretty good I can't say it's going to be
the<00:02:05.950> most<00:02:06.159> protection<00:02:06.609> you<00:02:06.820> ever<00:02:06.969> had<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
the most protection you ever had in the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.180 
the most protection you ever had in the
case<00:02:07.689> i<00:02:08.050> actually<00:02:08.560> prefer<00:02:09.750> TPU<00:02:10.750> softer<00:02:11.709> cases

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
case i actually prefer TPU softer cases

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.020 
case i actually prefer TPU softer cases
because<00:02:13.019> softer<00:02:14.019> cases<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.819> disperse<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
because softer cases can disperse the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.630 
because softer cases can disperse the
force<00:02:16.299> more<00:02:16.540> evenly<00:02:16.930> during<00:02:17.319> impact<00:02:17.640> harder

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
force more evenly during impact harder

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.880 
force more evenly during impact harder
cases<00:02:18.910> they'll<00:02:19.870> usually<00:02:20.200> pop<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
cases they'll usually pop out but this

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.600 
cases they'll usually pop out but this
case<00:02:24.250> feels<00:02:25.000> very<00:02:25.870> solid<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.860> very<00:02:26.890> premium

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
case feels very solid and very premium

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.170 
case feels very solid and very premium
and<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:29.260> been<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.590> case<00:02:29.830> review<00:02:30.250> hope<00:02:30.940> you
