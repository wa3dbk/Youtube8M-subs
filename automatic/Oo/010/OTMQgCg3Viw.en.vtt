00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.250 
tries to get used to the keyboard so
they<00:00:44.859> just<00:00:45.059> text<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.539> also<00:00:46.660> what<00:00:46.899> I<00:00:46.929> notice

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
they just text and also what I notice

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.950 
they just text and also what I notice
about<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:48.489> goes<00:00:48.820> up<00:00:49.149> I<00:00:49.539> don't<00:00:49.719> know<00:00:49.809> if<00:00:49.870> you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
about it it goes up I don't know if you

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.840 
about it it goes up I don't know if you
guys<00:00:50.050> can<00:00:50.109> maybe<00:00:50.410> see<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:50.829> too<00:00:51.039> well<00:00:51.219> but<00:00:51.699> it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
guys can maybe see this too well but it

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
guys can maybe see this too well but it
goes<00:00:52.030> up<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:54.190> on<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.640> side<00:00:54.910> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
goes up like this up on this side and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.250 
goes up like this up on this side and
it's<00:00:56.649> like<00:00:56.800> flat<00:00:57.100> here<00:00:57.489> for<00:00:57.730> these<00:00:57.879> keys<00:00:58.870> right

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
it's like flat here for these keys right

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.639 
it's like flat here for these keys right
here<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.679> then<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.670> goes<00:01:00.820> back<00:01:00.850> down<00:01:01.480> or<00:01:01.809> you

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
here and then it goes back down or you

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.240 
here and then it goes back down or you
could<00:01:02.800> say<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.100> goes<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.579> flat<00:01:04.420> down<00:01:05.250> basically

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
could say it goes up flat down basically

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.950 
could say it goes up flat down basically
just<00:01:06.670> curves<00:01:07.320> hence<00:01:08.320> curve<00:01:09.300> plus<00:01:10.300> this<00:01:10.690> part

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
just curves hence curve plus this part

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.340 
just curves hence curve plus this part
also<00:01:11.350> curves<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.460> think<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:13.540> don't<00:01:14.140> know<00:01:14.200> why

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
also curves so I think I don't know why

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.570 
also curves so I think I don't know why
they<00:01:14.500> call<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.830> curve<00:01:15.010> it's<00:01:15.160> either<00:01:15.310> for

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
they call it the curve it's either for

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.870 
they call it the curve it's either for
this<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.060> keyboard<00:01:16.450> curving<00:01:16.900> or<00:01:17.410> for<00:01:17.890> it

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
this the keyboard curving or for it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 
this the keyboard curving or for it
going<00:01:19.180> curving<00:01:19.660> like<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:19.990> like<00:01:20.230> curving

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
going curving like this like curving

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
going curving like this like curving
around<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.630> screen<00:01:22.990> it's<00:01:23.800> pretty<00:01:23.950> good

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
around and this screen it's pretty good

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.090 
around and this screen it's pretty good
so<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.720> put<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> blurriness<00:01:26.470> right<00:01:26.770> now<00:01:26.860> all

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
so I put a blurriness right now all

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.310 
so I put a blurriness right now all
right<00:01:27.250> here<00:01:27.400> we<00:01:27.430> go<00:01:27.580> it's<00:01:28.540> pretty<00:01:28.720> good<00:01:28.960> it's
