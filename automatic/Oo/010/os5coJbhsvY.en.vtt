welcome<00:00:04.140> friends<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.100> video<00:00:05.400> tutorial

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
welcome friends in this video tutorial

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.550 
welcome friends in this video tutorial
we<00:00:06.029> are<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.390> talk<00:00:06.600> about<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.080> mode<00:00:07.350> of

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
we are going to talk about the mode of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.169 
we are going to talk about the mode of
conservative<00:00:08.460> side<00:00:08.610> specifically

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
conservative side specifically

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.709 
conservative side specifically
combination<00:00:09.870> or<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.469> types<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.889> CSS<00:00:11.490> are<00:00:11.790> now

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
combination or the types of CSS are now

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.030 
combination or the types of CSS are now
in<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.080> case<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.530> seen<00:00:13.740> three

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
in this case we have seen three

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.220 
in this case we have seen three
different<00:00:14.070> types<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> insertion<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
different types one is insertion and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.620 
different types one is insertion and
deletion<00:00:16.260> then<00:00:17.010> inversion<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.359> three

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
deletion then inversion so these three

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
deletion then inversion so these three
steps<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:19.140> important<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.770> are<00:00:19.920> really

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
steps are important and these are really

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.740 
steps are important and these are really
really<00:00:20.279> simple<00:00:20.730> steps<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
really simple steps you can see the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
really simple steps you can see the
picture<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.109> will<00:00:22.289> understand<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:22.949> but

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
picture you will understand all but

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
picture you will understand all but
still<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.880> am<00:00:23.910> explaining<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:25.619> let

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
still I am explaining it to you now let

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.870 
still I am explaining it to you now let
me<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> color<00:00:26.400> okay

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
me take a color okay

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
me take a color okay
now<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.570> let<00:00:27.750> us<00:00:28.019> first<00:00:28.199> talk<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
now here let us first talk about the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
now here let us first talk about the
insertion<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.240> these

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
insertion if you think in all these

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810 
insertion if you think in all these
cases<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.710> donor<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
cases we have a donor and we have a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
cases we have a donor and we have a
recipient<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.200> case<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> very

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
recipient now in this case in the very

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
recipient now in this case in the very
first<00:00:35.070> case<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.600> region

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
first case if we think about this region

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.049 
first case if we think about this region
this<00:00:37.230> part<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> donor<00:00:38.550> region

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
this part so this is the donor region

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.790 
this part so this is the donor region
and<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> recipient

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and this is one this one is a recipient

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.389 
and this is one this one is a recipient
in<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> case<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.920> recipient<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.219> know

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
in this case so recipient as we know

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
in this case so recipient as we know
will<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:44.789> something<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> donor<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:46.739> give

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
will take something and donor will give

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
will take something and donor will give
something<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.059> case<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
something and in this case that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
something and in this case that
something<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> gene<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.620> donor<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.039> give

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
something is a gene so donor will give

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.770 
something is a gene so donor will give
the<00:00:50.370> gene<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.730> recipient<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.270> receive<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the gene and recipient will receive it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
the gene and recipient will receive it
now<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.559> case<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> gene<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> light

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
now in this case the gene is this light

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580 
now in this case the gene is this light
colored<00:00:54.120> orange<00:00:54.480> region<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> really

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
colored orange region and this is really

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
colored orange region and this is really
in<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.039> dark<00:00:56.340> orange<00:00:56.730> regions<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> site

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
in this dark orange regions are the site

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
in this dark orange regions are the site
which<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> marked<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
which which is marked that this this is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
which which is marked that this this is
the<00:01:00.870> start<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> gene<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> end<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the start of the gene this is the end of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
the start of the gene this is the end of
the<00:01:02.430> gene<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> marking<00:01:03.480> region<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the gene so it is the marking region and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.620 
the gene so it is the marking region and
this<00:01:04.320> black<00:01:04.619> site<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> specified<00:01:06.150> site

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this black site are the specified site

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.520 
this black site are the specified site
of<00:01:06.869> specified<00:01:07.530> locations<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:09.260> from<00:01:10.260> where

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of specified locations where from where

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
of specified locations where from where
this<00:01:10.890> gene<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.490> cut<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this gene will be cut and from where the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
this gene will be cut and from where the
gene<00:01:13.049> will<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.350> uptaken<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.670> we

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
gene will be uptaken right because we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.480 
gene will be uptaken right because we
are<00:01:14.880> talking<00:01:15.030> about<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.960> site-specific

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
are talking about the site-specific

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
are talking about the site-specific
recombination<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:18.030> cases<00:01:18.299> site

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
recombination in all these cases site

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
recombination in all these cases site
specificity<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.460> important

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
specificity is really really important

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
specificity is really really important
now<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> case<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> recipient<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> also

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
now in this case the recipient is also

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
now in this case the recipient is also
having<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> site<00:01:24.210> specificity<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
having the site specificity and also the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
having the site specificity and also the
these<00:01:26.549> donor<00:01:26.939> sequences<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.570> also<00:01:27.810> having

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
these donor sequences are also having

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.649 
these donor sequences are also having
that<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.520> cleave<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> sequence<00:01:30.450> from

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that so it will cleave the sequence from

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
that so it will cleave the sequence from
these<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.020> regions<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.130> sequence

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
these two regions and take this sequence

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
these two regions and take this sequence
and<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.659> incorporate<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.650> between

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and it will incorporate it in between

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.310 
and it will incorporate it in between
this<00:01:35.369> region<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> result<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:36.960> after

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this region and as a result right after

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.679 
this region and as a result right after
that<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.710> form<00:01:38.070> something<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> okay

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that will form something like that okay

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
that will form something like that okay
so<00:01:39.990> you'll<00:01:40.110> form<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> structure<00:01:41.390> okay<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.659> if

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so you'll form this structure okay so if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.770 
so you'll form this structure okay so if
you<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.740> genes<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> B<00:01:45.180> now

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you think about this genes a and B now

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
you think about this genes a and B now
in<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:45.990> case<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.439> find<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> end<00:01:46.890> B<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in this case you can find the end B in

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
in this case you can find the end B in
both<00:01:47.399> cases<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> necks<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.450> Y<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.689> there

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
both cases and the necks and Y is there

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
both cases and the necks and Y is there
as<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.560> okay<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.700> called<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
as it is okay so this is called the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730 
as it is okay so this is called the
insertion<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.290> deleting

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
insertion because we are not deleting

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
insertion because we are not deleting
anything<00:01:52.950> we're<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.280> inversing<00:01:53.970> anything<00:01:54.270> we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
anything we're not inversing anything we

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
anything we're not inversing anything we
are<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.689> taking<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.170> segment<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> gene<00:01:56.460> we

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
are just taking a segment of the gene we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
are just taking a segment of the gene we
incorporate<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.630> another<00:01:58.079> gene<00:01:58.350> that's

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
incorporate it into another gene that's

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
incorporate it into another gene that's
called<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> insertion<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> look

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
called the insertion now if you look

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
called the insertion now if you look
look<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> second<00:02:02.460> process<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
look about the second process which is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
look about the second process which is
called<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.329> deletion<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.530> name<00:02:04.710> suggests

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
called the deletion as the name suggests

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590 
called the deletion as the name suggests
we<00:02:05.159> will<00:02:05.280> delete<00:02:05.670> some<00:02:05.969> part<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> chain

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
we will delete some part of the chain

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
we will delete some part of the chain
suppose<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.530> longer<00:02:07.979> gene<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.759> yet<00:02:09.000> we

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
suppose this is a longer gene now yet we

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
suppose this is a longer gene now yet we
do<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.840> need<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> gene<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.649> between<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
do not need the gene in between that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.640 
do not need the gene in between that
means<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> genes<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.180> B

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
means the genes a and B

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.440 
means the genes a and B
not<00:02:12.829> need<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.280> gene<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.849> B<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.090> need<00:02:14.329> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
not need this gene a and B you need to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.569 
not need this gene a and B you need to
get<00:02:14.629> rid<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.959> these<00:02:15.230> genes<00:02:15.500> now<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.189> we'll<00:02:16.370> do

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
get rid of these genes now what we'll do

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.399 
get rid of these genes now what we'll do
we'll<00:02:16.849> cleave<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.360> part<00:02:17.689> out<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.230> these

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
we'll cleave this part out from these

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.380 
we'll cleave this part out from these
two<00:02:18.560> regions<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.129> it'll<00:02:19.519> make<00:02:19.700> us<00:02:19.879> make<00:02:20.329> a

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
two regions and it'll make us make a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.600 
two regions and it'll make us make a
circular<00:02:20.689> loop<00:02:21.200> out<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.459> it's

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
circular loop out of it and then it's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.149 
circular loop out of it and then it's
reseal<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.689> part<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.140> gene<00:02:24.319> we<00:02:24.470> need<00:02:24.920> in

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
reseal the part of the gene we need in

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.640 
reseal the part of the gene we need in
this<00:02:25.340> case<00:02:25.549> x<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.060> y<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.720> still<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.260> x<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.530> y

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
this case x and y we still the x and y

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.550 
this case x and y we still the x and y
we<00:02:27.950> cleave<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.640> B<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.019> make<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.049> circle<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
we cleave a and B and make a circle and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.929 
we cleave a and B and make a circle and
cleave<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.579> out

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
cleave it out

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.729 
cleave it out
we<00:02:32.150> call<00:02:32.329> it<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.599> deletion<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.560> name

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
we call it the deletion as the name

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.890 
we call it the deletion as the name
suggests<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.000> picture<00:02:35.329> pretty

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
suggests you can see the picture pretty

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.960 
suggests you can see the picture pretty
clearly<00:02:36.290> then<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.129> third<00:02:37.370> type<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.909> are

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
clearly then the third type we are

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.970 
clearly then the third type we are
talking<00:02:38.269> about<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.689> inversion<00:02:39.439> now<00:02:39.709> as<00:02:39.859> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
talking about the inversion now as the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.589 
talking about the inversion now as the
name<00:02:40.099> subject<00:02:40.489> inversion<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.239> means<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.569> are

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
name subject inversion that means we are

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.509 
name subject inversion that means we are
having<00:02:41.689> something<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.280> B

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
having something like that this a and B

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.720 
having something like that this a and B
they<00:02:44.120> inversely<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:45.799> inverse<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.549> two

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
they inversely we inverse it in two

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.819 
they inversely we inverse it in two
different<00:02:46.879> ways<00:02:47.239> one<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.569> first<00:02:48.290> inversion<00:02:48.590> is

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
different ways one is first inversion is

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.009 
different ways one is first inversion is
like<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.250> 180<00:02:49.670> degree<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.569> means<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.870> end

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
like that 180 degree that means we end

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.160 
like that 180 degree that means we end
up<00:02:51.139> with<00:02:51.290> B<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.450> second<00:02:53.870> inversion

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
up with B and a and the second inversion

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.940 
up with B and a and the second inversion
will<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.069> another<00:02:55.930> 180<00:02:56.930> degree<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.739> this

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
will be another 180 degree in this

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.179 
will be another 180 degree in this
direction<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:58.879> will<00:02:59.180> be<00:03:01.209> opposite<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.599> and

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
direction so that will be opposite a and

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.580 
direction so that will be opposite a and
an<00:03:04.189> opposite<00:03:04.760> B<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.989> challenge<00:03:06.260> okay

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
an opposite B this is the challenge okay

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.589 
an opposite B this is the challenge okay
so<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.389> two

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
so that is that is it right so two

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.869 
so that is that is it right so two
inversion<00:03:09.109> one<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.409> left<00:03:10.129> to<00:03:10.280> right<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.489> one

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
inversion one is left to right a one

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.449 
inversion one is left to right a one
until<00:03:11.150> again<00:03:11.389> this<00:03:11.599> up<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.769> down<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.129> top<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
until again this up up to down or top to

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.910 
until again this up up to down or top to
bottom<00:03:13.609> one<00:03:14.269> 180<00:03:14.930> D<00:03:15.139> so<00:03:15.409> two<00:03:15.590> types<00:03:15.769> of

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
bottom one 180 D so two types of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.530 
bottom one 180 D so two types of
inversion<00:03:16.459> in<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:16.699> case<00:03:16.879> you<00:03:16.970> can<00:03:17.120> see<00:03:17.299> here

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
inversion in this case you can see here

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.300 
inversion in this case you can see here
so<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.049> will<00:03:18.139> cleave<00:03:18.470> from<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.859> first<00:03:19.129> sides

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
so it will cleave from this first sides

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.949 
so it will cleave from this first sides
and<00:03:19.660> then<00:03:20.660> inversion<00:03:21.730> then<00:03:22.730> again<00:03:23.090> reseal<00:03:23.720> and

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
and then inversion then again reseal and

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.589 
and then inversion then again reseal and
remake<00:03:24.949> all<00:03:25.160> these<00:03:25.430> things<00:03:25.669> so<00:03:26.090> as<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.299> result

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
remake all these things so as a result

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.149 
remake all these things so as a result
what<00:03:26.870> we'll<00:03:27.049> end<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.530> we'll<00:03:27.829> end<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.099> with

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
what we'll end up with we'll end up with

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.339 
what we'll end up with we'll end up with
the<00:03:28.549> location<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.329> varying<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> location

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
the location of the varying the location

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.229 
the location of the varying the location
of<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.560> genes<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> normal<00:03:31.819> gene<00:03:32.030> we<00:03:32.150> are

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
of the genes in the normal gene we are

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.680 
of the genes in the normal gene we are
having<00:03:32.419> a<00:03:33.139> right<00:03:33.709> next<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.370> X<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.909> be<00:03:35.480> right

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
having a right next to X and be right

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.949 
having a right next to X and be right
next<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.019> Y<00:03:36.230> but<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:36.889> case<00:03:37.099> of<00:03:37.129> this<00:03:37.400> inverse

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
next to Y but in case of this inverse

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.110 
next to Y but in case of this inverse
segment<00:03:38.959> we<00:03:39.079> are<00:03:39.169> having<00:03:39.319> B<00:03:40.310> instead<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.879> a

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
segment we are having B instead of a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.789 
segment we are having B instead of a
next<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.720> next<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.229> X<00:03:42.349> right

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
next to it next to X right

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.530 
next to it next to X right
so<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> varying<00:03:43.819> proportion<00:03:44.479> of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so this is a varying proportion of

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.530 
so this is a varying proportion of
inversion<00:03:45.109> so<00:03:45.470> no<00:03:45.709> information<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.370> lost<00:03:46.879> but

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
inversion so no information is lost but

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.619 
inversion so no information is lost but
still<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.989> information<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.530> shuffled<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.190> to

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
still the information is shuffled and to

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.119 
still the information is shuffled and to
eventually<00:03:50.629> create<00:03:50.780> some<00:03:51.139> difference<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.829> the

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
eventually create some difference in the

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.219 
eventually create some difference in the
expression<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:52.729> this<00:03:52.849> gene<00:03:52.909> okay<00:03:53.389> as<00:03:53.569> we<00:03:53.930> know

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
expression of this gene okay as we know

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.960 
expression of this gene okay as we know
because<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.650> small<00:03:54.979> change<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:55.669> gene

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
because the small change in this gene

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.089 
because the small change in this gene
can<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.359> can<00:03:56.750> express<00:03:57.049> lethally<00:03:57.680> can<00:03:57.829> express

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
can it can express lethally can express

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.059 
can it can express lethally can express
devastating<00:03:59.000> right<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.840> we<00:03:59.989> know<00:04:00.139> that<00:04:00.319> okay

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
devastating right and we know that okay

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.729 
devastating right and we know that okay
so<00:04:01.599> but<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:02.810> most<00:04:03.019> important<00:04:03.500> thing<00:04:03.620> about

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
so but the most important thing about

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.740 
so but the most important thing about
all<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:04.609> all<00:04:04.849> these<00:04:05.120> cases<00:04:05.389> there<00:04:05.690> are

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
all in all these cases there are

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.500 
all in all these cases there are
specified<00:04:06.530> regions<00:04:07.040> those<00:04:07.549> are<00:04:07.879> conserved

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
specified regions those are conserved

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.059 
specified regions those are conserved
and<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.840> specified<00:04:09.319> regions<00:04:09.680> are<00:04:09.829> really

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
and the specified regions are really

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.659 
and the specified regions are really
important<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:11.389> take<00:04:11.780> any<00:04:12.079> part<00:04:12.709> inside

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
important to to take any part inside

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.029 
important to to take any part inside
this<00:04:13.909> CSS<00:04:14.329> R<00:04:14.599> so<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.049> have<00:04:15.199> to<00:04:15.349> cleave<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.799> you

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
this CSS R so it have to cleave it you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.800 
this CSS R so it have to cleave it you
need<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.220> specific<00:04:16.489> side<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.030> need<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.299> join<00:04:17.599> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
need a specific side you need to join it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.629 
need a specific side you need to join it
you<00:04:17.930> need<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.109> specific<00:04:18.620> side<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.310> that's<00:04:19.489> why

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
you need a specific side so that's why

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.519 
you need a specific side so that's why
they<00:04:19.789> are<00:04:19.820> called<00:04:20.060> size<00:04:20.959> specific

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:21.529 
they are called size specific

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.950 
they are called size specific
recombination<00:04:22.130> side<00:04:22.520> okay<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.419> that's<00:04:23.630> it<00:04:23.840> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
recombination side okay so that's it and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.520 
recombination side okay so that's it and
I<00:04:24.050> hope<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.320> will<00:04:24.440> help<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.710> thank<00:04:25.400> you
