00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.220
Laink : Hey, did you leave without me ?

Oh no, I thought he was leaving !

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.300

Terracid : Arrrrrgh !

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.320
Laink : I don't give a shit !

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.060
I've lost my wife and my children !

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.360
[laughs]

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.560
I'm Max Payne bastard !

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.160
I don't care !

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.460
Terracid : I neither have a wife nor children

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.400
Arrrrrgh !

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.600
Laink : And on top of that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.620
I don't have friends !

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.120
No one is waiting for me at home !

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.920
Laink : Go ! I'm shooting the cops

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.840
I'm creating a diversion !

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.240
Terracid : Oops..

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.040
Laink : So, you're pushing the wrong button.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.840
Game NPC : Come on ! We have to keep going !

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.160
Laink : We have to keep going !

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.580
Terracid : Hey, who's that over there ?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.240
He's doing nothing, why is he doing nothing ?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.780
Laink : Who's that ?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.440
Terracid : Come see

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.020
Laink : You're gonna kill him ?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm coming then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.100
Terracid : OOH ! He cutted me !

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.240
Oh the bluff !

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.600
Aaah ! Bastard !

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.900
You know, he says nothing

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.880
he was looking at me and then he did :

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.420
Ahhh take this !

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.760
Laink : *laughs*

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.040
If you want, we can unite

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.340
and get out of here alive

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.080
Terracid : *laughs*

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.460
Terracid : Hehehehe !

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.840
Laink : Hehehehe

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.340
We're the pro of QTEs

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Terracid : Is that his face ?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.980
Yeah it is his face !

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.360
Laink : That's him !

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.980
Terracid : It's okay, i'm calling my girl

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.400
Laink : *laughs*

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.920
Honey, I've won

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.000
Terracid : *laughs*

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.200
It's done ! Aah !

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.660
Hey look !

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.360
It's my ass !

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.780
Laink : *laughs*

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.580
Look, we're already on Twitter

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.720
Two

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.660
One

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.940
Shit !

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.400
Terracid : They won't be watching TV anymore

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.240
Laink : Damn, stop doing this you're stressing me !

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.360
I'm always imagining the fat guy with his burger

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.720
in the video surveillance room

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.020
He sees the screens turning off one by one

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.940
and he's telling himself

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.960
"Weird..."

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.540
Terracid : You didn't manage to break it !

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.360
Laink : Quick ! I'm running !

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.880
Quick !

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520
Terracid : He passed by on full speed !

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.360
Laink : *laughs*

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.600
Protect the convoy,  well yeah

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.840
but it's gonna be hard

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.300
Fuck...

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.640
It's going to be complicated

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.580
Oh shit, another RPG

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.080
Everything's okay

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.200
Terracid : It's okay, it continues to move on fire !

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.540
Laink : It's okay, the engine is intact.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880
Terracid : There are juste the ones which are passing that are burning !

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.060
Nothing to report !

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.220
Laink : Pur your pants back on !

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.440
Laink [whisper] : The camera...

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.660
Terracid : *laughs*

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.480

Laink : Come on ! Come on come on !

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.040
Come oooon !

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.980
*They both laugh*

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.220
Terracid : HURRY UUUUP !

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.520

Laink : *laughs*

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.260
Under his feet

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.880
Like in the Western movies

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.440
I'm blocking his path with cardboard boxes

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.760
Soo...

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.080
Terracid : I'm keeping him from passing

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
Laink : I'm putting your fat calves under a hard test ?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.700
Go on

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.340
Go scout the area to see what's happening

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.420
Terracid : Ah ! I was starting to chase him !

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.560
Laink : Oh no !

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.120
It's behind you !

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.940
Hurry ! Run !

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.980
It's still behind you !

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.300
I'm trying to hold it back !

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.560
I'm trying to hold it back !

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.900
Ah !

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280
Terracid : It's going too fast !

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.300
Laink : Hurry ! Run with all your strength !

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.620
Terracid : Rha ! I'm covering on the ground !

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.240
It was a close call !

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.060
Laink : In the end, it's that door that took everything !

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.080
Thank God !

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.020
The KFC !

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.560
Stop to the chicken !

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.160
Terracid ! There !

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.940
Stop

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.560

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.880
We want some Kebab

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.680
Terracid : Quick ! I'm swapping my thing with a sniper

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.560
Quick quick quick !

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.980

Laink : Thanks ma'am...

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.300
Ma'am can I have extra ammo ?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.520
*laughs*

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.620
Terracid : We still have extra ammos ?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.920
*laughs*

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.560
Laink : You still got some grenades ?

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.820
*laughs*

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.300
Laink : Ma'am can I take two grenades ?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.360
Terracid : Aaah !

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.040
*laughs*

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.380
Laink : We'll soon see the end Johnson

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.720
We're gonne be able to go home

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360
and stop this damned war

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.740
Come on Hamid !

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.100
Come on Hamid, we're pissed !

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.500
*laughs*

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.780
Terracid : We don't have time for this !

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.800
Laink : Hurry !

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.260
We have a game to win

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.920
Hurry dammit !

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.080
Terracid : He's slow...

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.840
Laink : Yeah !

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.340
But him, he's always the last one who's picked in P.E

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.780
He's very very slow !

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.420
Come on come oooon !

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.840
You'll never be able to make friends Hamid

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.960
if you keep going like this

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.420
Oh !

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.760
Washing machines !

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.200
Terracid : They're trapped !

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.540
Laink : They're all trapped !

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.200
But perhaps...

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.160
Perhaps they're trapped...

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.240
Who's telling us the contrary ?

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.160
The State ?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.220
Nonsense

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.560
If the State trapped the washing machines

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.560
They won't tell us

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.000
Hamid ! Which car are you into ?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.900
Ah there you are Hamid

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.400
You're okay ?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.040
Feeling nice ?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.920
Well, i'm trying huh

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.500
Terracid : Ah ! But i died in the thing !

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.720
Ah, no, I'm getting out to die.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
It's a clever system.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.100
Laink : Hey, you're in the air.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.880
Well, hm, i'm going out.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.260
Terracid : I can't even get back in ?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.400
Laink : I can't come out.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.480
I can't come out there's a bug.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.100
Terracid : This mission is nice.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.480
Laink : There's a bug, there's a bug.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.400
Terracid : Heey !

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.340
Laink : I'm leaving without you !

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.060
Terracid : You're abandoning me here just like that ?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.100
Laink : Oh no !

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.020
But does it mean that you're gonna die ?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.980
It means that we've lost ?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.600
Oh God...

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.260
It looks like a Disney ride

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.880
With pirates in plastic

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.040
Terracid : Yeah, yeah

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.420
Laink : Getting out of my place relaxed

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320
Knock the camera

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.700
*laughs*

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.120
I just got a picture in my head

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.300
The guy he says "Knock the camera"

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.560
And the guy knocks on the camera with his hand

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.740
until it falls down.
