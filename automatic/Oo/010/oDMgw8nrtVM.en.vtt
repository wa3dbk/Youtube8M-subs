I played 40 minutes to the game so I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
I played 40 minutes to the game so I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that I'm willing to work and hopefully

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.980 
that I'm willing to work and hopefully
that<00:01:33.990> won't<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> problem<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that won't be a problem but you know you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
that won't be a problem but you know you
just<00:01:37.020> gotta<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.610> guess<00:01:38.610> take<00:01:38.820> each<00:01:38.970> each

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
just gotta I guess take each each

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
just gotta I guess take each each
instance<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.049> each<00:01:40.170> situation<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.979> make

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
instance in each situation and just make

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.819 
instance in each situation and just make
the<00:01:41.369> best<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> sounds<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.409> curry

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the best of it so it sounds like curry

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350 
the best of it so it sounds like curry
wants<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> Warriors

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
wants to be here and the Warriors

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
wants to be here and the Warriors
