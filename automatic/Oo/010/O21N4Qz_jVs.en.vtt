00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 Hey, people, panda beauty talking to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 people talk in fundeic play 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 battlefield 3 did not want to talk about 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.760
 absence of furniture and six at night there 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 Is not it? I wanted to talk to you about it. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.880
 it was an unexpected thing for me 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
 mavs and were already ready here and I 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.810
 I'm leaving normally next week. 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.179
 what happened that did not to do 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 upload them this week is do not know if 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.200
 You noticed but leave a little 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 video too this week I'm small 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 video on headsets on Tuesday and I 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.879
 There was more video to put to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 But you were at my father's house there. 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.950
 internet is not so good for the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 videos and it turned out that I could not 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 pay the rest in demand for three more 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 hours for that headset video and I 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 I had another video, it was a little bit 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 smaller and took another five hours and gave 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 Error in the end so I did not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.300
 opting and pupa video for you and me 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.140
 I got home on Saturday now this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.299
 week, right? 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.740
 so everything will be back to normal there 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.200
 will probably have enough 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.960
 videos this week and the mob is on 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.720
 come back next week about who went 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.090
 indeed a son and three is played 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.700
 quite and is the one with the cuts to ikea 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.150
 which was a new map pack of the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 Garfield that for me surpasses all 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.820
 others that mw3 has already released is a package 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 this map pack with the cuts is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.790
 very good even a little more action 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.280
 It's near you and neither are the maps smaller. 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.530
 and it's just a killing so it's really good 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 for who likes things and wants to play 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 with the bellfield guns on the maps to see 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.680
 the son, I think it's very interesting 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.110
 It 's just that they see a little of the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.049
 of tdm with courts are playing with 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.259
 this f 2000 and that they say I am a weapon 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.850
 or see, I can not pump and I can squeeze a little 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 more about this rivalry and di bello 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 son versus mw3 I think it's one thing 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 very silly 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 and that the staff still has a bit of 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.430
 personal color prejudice has 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 prejudice against the son he thinks 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 which is a bit more of a game too 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 more 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.290
 there already do not know a product more in right action 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.310
 which does not cease to be true I was one 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.800
 little more without the action than of mw3 of the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 which cody in general because the maps a 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.220
 little bigger and a thousand always are 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.110
 further 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 mother is still a very 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010
 fun and personal to see the son 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.460
 also has a prejudice account cody nÃ© 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.900
 what's the name of the day is a little game 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.210
 100 strategy game game that the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.130
 people come out killing just like crazy 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.590
 which also does not cease to be true 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.410
 a lot more game that you can act 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.970
 alone there and ends up killing everyone and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 win the game alone 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.280
 but that does not make it does not make 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 games are bad is my son who has 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.300
 its moments of action and today 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.280
 also had a moment of strategy there 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 the competitive not to say the opposite 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.160
 huh 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 so I think the staff have for a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.140
 little with this is this rivalry is this 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 That was a good pace, neither 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.720
 as they say then it was the end of a game 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 excellent race too I think one 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.769
 the main differences between cut to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.470
 The son for me is not talking here in the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.660
 My opinion, I think I ran a 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.420
 much more game you play with friends 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.160
 It's a lot more game for you and it gives you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.150
 much more interaction for you to play with 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.190
 friends, right? 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.100
 and you're going to play, go and have a chat 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.560
 cool, how are you guys at the same time? 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.269
 It has a nice game to play in the background. 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280
 where you do not need so much 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.650
 communication 11 minutes ahead 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.470
 strategy you can be there to give a 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.580
 zapped with friends playing with a gun 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.640
 It will be different, then. 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.170
 go play is going to chat a go-go of 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.459
 contracting there with friends will hit a 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.680
 talk about other things that are not 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.690
 game and I think this is the main 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.910
 difference I think my son you 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.230
 You can even do this but it's not as 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.510
 simple, right? 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.290
 You can only make one wall up to four 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.260
 people 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.420
 and it's much, much more I do not know the day there 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.340
 difficult I think the Coritiba that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.099
 promotes ease with a simple 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.259
 two clicks you 're in a game right 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.109
 It's how your friends call themselves the world. 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.419
 They prepare very fast and I think it 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.080
 in big difference you hit 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.300
 chat 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.639
 but playing steam because it interacts a lot 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.220
 more that the maps are smaller or 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.440
 game modes are much easier and 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.780
 do not need the continuous strategy 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.060
 bellfield I think this to me is a 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.919
 of the main differences was that 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.360
 I fell in love so much for the back 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.030
 office did not always play with someone 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.020
 always played on the stop is always playing with 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.509
 the people who called me vital of the clan 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.320
 I think the movie is not so so you. 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:58.479
 do not have so many moments of action and there 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.039
 staff does not interact so much 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.349
 so the staff is talking to you 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.199
 It is wrong to see his fellow 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.509
 team and although there was a system of 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.550
 discord and rarely saw their 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.400
 comrades here because they look good 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.150
 away from you and you have an action 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.070
 much more primary than I say you 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.110
 She's got so much more alone from the fifth 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.750
 with your teammates, right? 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.099
 It's good, but this is what it is. This is what I 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.449
 I wanted to talk to you today. 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.500
 I think the staff gave a little 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.060
 this rivalry are two great games and 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.220
 It is up to you to choose which two 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.690
 You want but that's it I hope you have 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.729
 liked the gameplay video di bello 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.010
 background in the background worth the game back 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.010
 This week usually and father
