00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
video is my Casio exf c100 the reason I

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720 
video is my Casio exf c100 the reason I
chose<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> get<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.889> camera<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.639> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
chose to get this camera is because it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
chose to get this camera is because it
can<00:00:14.820> take<00:00:15.000> high-speed<00:00:15.509> video<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.139> other<00:00:16.260> words

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
can take high-speed video in other words

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
can take high-speed video in other words
slow<00:00:17.070> motion<00:00:17.279> video<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.180> has<00:00:18.330> various<00:00:18.660> options

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
slow motion video it has various options

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
slow motion video it has various options
as<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> how<00:00:19.260> slow<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.619> want<00:00:19.800> video<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.670> for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
as to how slow you want video but for

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900 
as to how slow you want video but for
this<00:00:21.029> projects<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.869> using<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.519> 210<00:00:23.519> frames

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this projects I'm using it as 210 frames

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
this projects I'm using it as 210 frames
per<00:00:24.090> second<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.019> seven<00:00:25.949> times

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
per second which is about seven times

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
per second which is about seven times
slower<00:00:26.670> than<00:00:26.789> real<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> record<00:00:28.019> set

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
slower than real time but it record set

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.160 
slower than real time but it record set
at<00:00:28.490> 360<00:00:29.490> P<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> quite<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> low<00:00:30.990> resolution

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
at 360 P which is quite a low resolution

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
at 360 P which is quite a low resolution
but<00:00:31.920> believe<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> highest

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but believe it or not that's the highest

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
but believe it or not that's the highest
resolution<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.690> camera'll<00:00:34.050> taggcat

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
resolution is camera'll taggcat

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
resolution is camera'll taggcat
slow-motion<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.030> I've<00:00:36.120> chosen

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
slow-motion so that's what I've chosen

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
slow-motion so that's what I've chosen
to<00:00:36.510> use<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.530> thing<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.739> had<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> do

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to use so the first thing I had to do

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
to use so the first thing I had to do
was<00:00:38.219> build<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> set<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> built

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
was build the set this is what I built

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470 
was build the set this is what I built
to<00:00:40.350> support<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> set<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.670> basically<00:00:42.090> wooden

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
to support the set it's basically wooden

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.569 
to support the set it's basically wooden
planks<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.110> loads<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> books<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
planks and then loads of books and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
planks and then loads of books and
pieces<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> furniture<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> tray<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.230> going

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
pieces of furniture so the tray is going

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
pieces of furniture so the tray is going
to<00:00:46.500> wrap<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.059> nice<00:00:48.059> long<00:00:48.329> run<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> can

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to wrap here nice long run up so I can

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
to wrap here nice long run up so I can
get<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.500> good<00:00:49.620> speed<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.760> build

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
get some good speed and then I build

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
get some good speed and then I build
some<00:00:51.899> sort<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.219> trestle<00:00:53.219> bridge<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.640> which

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
some sort of trestle bridge thing which

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
some sort of trestle bridge thing which
you'll<00:00:54.300> sit<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> train<00:00:55.440> going

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you'll sit on here with the train going

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
you'll sit on here with the train going
along<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> it'll<00:00:56.520> go<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> fall<00:00:57.570> over

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
along here and it'll go and fall over

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
along here and it'll go and fall over
the<00:00:57.809> edge<00:00:57.840> down<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.219> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the edge down there so now I put this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
the edge down there so now I put this
green<00:01:00.030> blanket<00:01:00.300> over<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> top<00:01:00.980> hopefully

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
green blanket over the top hopefully

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
green blanket over the top hopefully
I'll<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.340> look<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.640> more<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.239> sort

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I'll make it look a bit more like a sort

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
I'll make it look a bit more like a sort
of<00:01:03.629> railway<00:01:03.930> embankment<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.100> building

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
of railway embankment so I'm building

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
of railway embankment so I'm building
the<00:01:05.489> trestle<00:01:05.880> bridge<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> connects

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the trestle bridge out of connects

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810 
the trestle bridge out of connects
because<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.369> building<00:01:08.790> large

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
because it's good for building large

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
because it's good for building large
structural<00:01:09.689> stuff<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
structural stuff and I don't really have

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
structural stuff and I don't really have
the<00:01:10.860> bits<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> Lego<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the bits to do in Lego so I'm going to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
the bits to do in Lego so I'm going to
build<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> sort<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> main<00:01:13.770> frame<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
build the sort of main frame like this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
build the sort of main frame like this
and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.479> I'm<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> put<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.439> bits<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and then I'm going to put these bits on

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.219 
and then I'm going to put these bits on
the<00:01:17.640> side<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.210> angles<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:19.020> like

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the side as an angles make it look like

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.440 
the side as an angles make it look like
a<00:01:19.259> proper<00:01:19.590> trestle<00:01:20.009> bridge<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
a proper trestle bridge and this is the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
a proper trestle bridge and this is the
finished<00:01:21.689> bridge<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:22.799> pleased<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.130> how

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
finished bridge I'm quite pleased of how

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
finished bridge I'm quite pleased of how
it<00:01:23.340> turned<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.869> God<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.140> its<00:01:25.259> job

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it turned out I think God do its job

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
it turned out I think God do its job
considering<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.040> only<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> screen<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
considering I only be on screen for a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
considering I only be on screen for a
few<00:01:27.119> seconds<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> moment<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.770> filming

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
few seconds so at the moment I'm filming

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
few seconds so at the moment I'm filming
shots<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.790> require<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.270> model<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
shots which don't require the model to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.390 
shots which don't require the model to
hit<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> ground<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.229> break<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.130> I'll<00:01:32.220> set

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
hit in the ground and break so I'll set

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.530 
hit in the ground and break so I'll set
this<00:01:32.520> thing<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> sort<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> cushion<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this thing up to sort of cushion the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
this thing up to sort of cushion the
impact<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> sort<00:01:34.909> tarpaulin<00:01:35.909> over

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
impact it's just a sort tarpaulin over

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
impact it's just a sort tarpaulin over
some<00:01:36.270> chairs<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.900> catch<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> there

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
some chairs to catch it from up there

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.300 
some chairs to catch it from up there
and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.579> over<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> pond<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.159> I've

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and then over here we got a pond so I've

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
then that will sends the Train zooming

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.490 
then that will sends the Train zooming
off<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.420> end<00:02:48.540> now<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.019> order<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.319> make<00:02:49.470> sure

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
off the end now in order to make sure

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.259 
off the end now in order to make sure
what's<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.549> thing<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> end<00:02:50.940> doesn't

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
what's that thing at the end doesn't

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.180 
what's that thing at the end doesn't
also<00:02:51.569> zoom<00:02:51.750> off<00:02:51.959> right<00:02:52.590> here<00:02:52.829> I've<00:02:53.010> got<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
also zoom off right here I've got a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.250 
also zoom off right here I've got a
break<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.700> track<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.510> forward<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.170> this

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
break in the track so forward of this

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.140 
break in the track so forward of this
position<00:02:55.709> there's<00:02:55.920> no<00:02:56.010> power<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> track<00:02:56.700> so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
position there's no power to track so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.630 
position there's no power to track so
that's<00:02:57.450> green<00:02:58.110> tender<00:02:58.560> will<00:02:59.040> contour<00:02:59.370> stop

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that's green tender will contour stop

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.420 
that's green tender will contour stop
before<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> end<00:03:00.090> they've<00:03:00.480> also<00:03:00.660> got<00:03:01.430> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
before the end they've also got this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.670 
before the end they've also got this
cable<00:03:02.840> which<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.930> attached<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> middle

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
cable which is attached to the middle

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
cable which is attached to the middle
and<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.340> sort<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.549> safety<00:03:05.940> measure<00:03:06.120> to

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and that's a sort of safety measure to

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.360 
and that's a sort of safety measure to
stop<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.440> string<00:03:07.739> hurtling<00:03:08.069> off<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> edge

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
stop this string hurtling off the edge

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.309 
stop this string hurtling off the edge
too<00:03:08.610> right<00:03:09.030> now<00:03:09.239> I'm<00:03:09.510> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> test<00:03:10.140> run

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
too right now I'm going to do a test run

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.130 
too right now I'm going to do a test run
with<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.500> little<00:03:10.560> truck<00:03:10.950> rather<00:03:11.819> lens

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
with this little truck rather lens

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:22.550 
with this little truck rather lens
damaging<00:03:13.140> my<00:03:13.500> steam<00:03:13.769> logo<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.549> here<00:03:14.760> goes<00:03:21.560> so

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
damaging my steam logo so here goes so

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080 
damaging my steam logo so here goes so
the<00:03:22.739> first<00:03:22.920> attempts<00:03:23.280> didn't<00:03:23.489> go<00:03:23.609> too<00:03:23.670> badly

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the first attempts didn't go too badly

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.940 
the first attempts didn't go too badly
but<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> train<00:03:25.230> was<00:03:25.260> definitely<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.739> too

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
but the train was definitely going too

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.949 
but the train was definitely going too
slowly<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.639> went<00:03:26.760> off<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.060> end<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.870> I've

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
slowly as it went off the end so I've

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.629 
slowly as it went off the end so I've
made<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> few<00:03:28.260> changes<00:03:28.319> this<00:03:29.040> connection

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
made a few changes this connection

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.150 
made a few changes this connection
points<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:30.150> which<00:03:30.720> splits<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.139> track<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
points here which splits the track and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.650 
points here which splits the track and
move<00:03:32.370> further<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> end<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.359> therefore

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
move further to the end and therefore

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.620 
move further to the end and therefore
the<00:03:33.780> train<00:03:34.560> will<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.769> powered<00:03:35.190> or<00:03:36.150> more<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
the train will be powered or more of the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.080 
the train will be powered or more of the
distance<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.620> should<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.889> going<00:03:38.069> faster<00:03:38.459> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
distance so it should be going faster to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.309 
distance so it should be going faster to
make<00:03:39.180> doubly<00:03:39.510> sure<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:39.989> thing<00:03:40.200> doesn't

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
make doubly sure but this thing doesn't

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.430 
make doubly sure but this thing doesn't
go<00:03:40.410> off<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> ends<00:03:40.920> I've<00:03:41.280> attached<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.700> new

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
go off the ends I've attached a new

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
go off the ends I've attached a new
safety<00:03:43.440> line<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.040> which<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.400> proper<00:03:44.609> string

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
safety line to it which is proper string

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.250 
safety line to it which is proper string
that's<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.630> prep<00:03:45.810> work<00:03:45.989> done

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that's the prep work done

00:03:46.260 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's the prep work done
time<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.739> get<00:03:46.799> filming

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.040 

well<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.240> roughly<00:04:12.510> where<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.720> model

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
well this is roughly where the model

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.540 
well this is roughly where the model
landed<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.530> grounds<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.040> as<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.400> see

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
landed on the grounds and as you can see

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
landed on the grounds and as you can see
the<00:04:14.700> parts<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.120> gone<00:04:15.300> absolutely

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
the parts have gone absolutely

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.880 
the parts have gone absolutely
everywhere<00:04:16.350> that's<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> cab<00:04:17.730> down<00:04:18.000> there

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
everywhere that's the cab down there

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.130 
everywhere that's the cab down there
it's<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:20.010> tender<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.390> chassis<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:21.840> actually

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
it's a tender the chassis is actually

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.890 
it's a tender the chassis is actually
remained<00:04:22.410> fairly<00:04:22.560> intact<00:04:22.980> which<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.900> expected

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
remained fairly intact which is expected

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.710 
remained fairly intact which is expected
and<00:04:25.050> bits<00:04:25.920> leboyer

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
and bits leboyer

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.510 
and bits leboyer
made<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.870> all<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> way<00:04:28.140> over<00:04:28.230> here<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.310> yeah

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
made it all the way over here so yeah

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:41.560 
made it all the way over here so yeah
quite<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.540> mess

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.020 

so<00:04:42.440> I've<00:04:42.560> rebuilt<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.980> model<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.460> now<00:04:43.970> I'm

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
so I've rebuilt the model and now I'm

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.580 
so I've rebuilt the model and now I'm
going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.300> shoot<00:04:44.450> some<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.870> minor<00:04:45.110> shots

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
going to shoot some of the minor shots

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.250 
going to shoot some of the minor shots
the<00:04:46.250> beginning<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.700> video<00:04:47.020> first<00:04:48.020> one's

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
the beginning of the video first one's

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
the beginning of the video first one's
going<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.470> be<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:48.710> going<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.890> smash<00:04:49.160> through

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
going to be it's going to smash through

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.830 
going to be it's going to smash through
this<00:04:49.430> wooden<00:04:49.730> sign<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.300> I've<00:04:50.390> got<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.660> camera

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
this wooden sign so I've got the camera

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.960 
this wooden sign so I've got the camera
set<00:04:51.140> up<00:04:51.170> here<00:04:51.440> because<00:04:52.160> it's<00:04:52.340> on<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.490> tripod<00:04:52.730> I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
set up here because it's on the tripod I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.950 
set up here because it's on the tripod I
don't<00:04:53.180> have<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.390> worry<00:04:53.540> about<00:04:53.630> all<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
don't have to worry about all the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.780 
don't have to worry about all the
automatic<00:04:54.290> launch<00:04:54.980> system<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.610> just

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
automatic launch system and I can just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.610 
automatic launch system and I can just
shove<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.630> train<00:04:56.840> through<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.140> with<00:04:57.260> my<00:04:57.410> hand

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
shove the train through it with my hand

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.680 
shove the train through it with my hand
I<00:04:57.860> don't<00:04:58.670> want<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.880> going<00:04:58.970> out<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.210> window<00:04:59.510> so

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
I don't want it going out the window so

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.260 
I don't want it going out the window so
I<00:04:59.720> built<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.430> lock<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.460> Lego<00:05:01.790> here<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.060> stop

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
I built this lock of Lego here to stop

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:11.200 
I built this lock of Lego here to stop
it<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.400> as<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:10.700> might<00:05:10.790> have<00:05:10.970> heard<00:05:11.180> that

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
it so as you might have heard that

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.550 
it so as you might have heard that
didn't<00:05:11.540> really<00:05:11.630> go<00:05:11.840> according<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.200> plan

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
didn't really go according to plan

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.880 
didn't really go according to plan
so<00:05:13.280> I've<00:05:13.370> rebuilt<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.850> engine<00:05:13.880> again<00:05:14.540> and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
so I've rebuilt the engine again and

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.580 
so I've rebuilt the engine again and
this<00:05:15.890> time<00:05:16.160> I've<00:05:16.310> tied<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.700> track<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:18.560> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
this time I've tied the track to the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.040 
this time I've tied the track to the
bridge<00:05:18.920> so<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.610> won't<00:05:19.850> come<00:05:20.000> off<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.510> also<00:05:20.870> I'm

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
bridge so it won't come off and also I'm

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.570 
bridge so it won't come off and also I'm
going<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.230> push<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.860> engine<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.160> lot<00:05:22.340> slower

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
going to push the engine a lot slower

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.670 
going to push the engine a lot slower
because<00:05:22.820> last<00:05:23.150> time<00:05:23.420> it's<00:05:24.260> definitely<00:05:24.560> too

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
because last time it's definitely too

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.650 
because last time it's definitely too
hard<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:31.310> was<00:05:31.430> all<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.640> filming<00:05:31.970> done<00:05:32.180> now

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
hard that was all the filming done now

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.780 
hard that was all the filming done now
just<00:05:32.900> needed<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.230> edit<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:34.340> first<00:05:34.580> thing<00:05:34.700> I

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
just needed to edit it the first thing I

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.130 
just needed to edit it the first thing I
did<00:05:34.940> was<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.240> convert<00:05:35.480> the<00:05:35.630> video<00:05:35.840> so<00:05:36.110> it

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
did was to convert the video so it

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.140 
did was to convert the video so it
played<00:05:36.500> back<00:05:36.710> at<00:05:36.860> 25<00:05:37.310> frames<00:05:37.520> per<00:05:37.820> second

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
played back at 25 frames per second

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.060 
played back at 25 frames per second
rather<00:05:38.330> than<00:05:38.570> 30<00:05:38.900> therefore<00:05:39.620> slowing<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.040> down

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
rather than 30 therefore slowing it down

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.190 
rather than 30 therefore slowing it down
even<00:05:40.490> further<00:05:40.730> I<00:05:41.060> did<00:05:41.330> this<00:05:41.510> using<00:05:41.750> software

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
even further I did this using software

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.830 
even further I did this using software
called<00:05:42.380> avi<00:05:42.800> sin<00:05:43.250> after<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.300> converted

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
called avi sin after that I converted

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.380 
called avi sin after that I converted
the<00:05:44.930> video<00:05:45.200> into<00:05:45.500> WMV<00:05:46.100> format<00:05:46.370> using<00:05:47.060> movavi

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
the video into WMV format using movavi

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.750 
the video into WMV format using movavi
video<00:05:47.690> converter<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.530> then<00:05:49.130> edited<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
video converter and then edited the

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.030 
video converter and then edited the
video<00:05:50.060> using<00:05:50.510> Windows<00:05:50.840> Movie<00:05:51.260> Maker<00:05:51.440> version
