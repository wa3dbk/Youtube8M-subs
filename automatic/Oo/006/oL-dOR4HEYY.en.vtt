scientists got lots of neat details and

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.389 
scientists got lots of neat details and
this<00:02:06.409> is<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.890> reasons<00:02:07.130> why<00:02:07.250> I'm

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
this is one of the reasons why I'm

this is one of the reasons why I'm
fascinated<00:02:07.969> by<00:02:08.390> these<00:02:08.770> helmets<00:02:09.770> they<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.070> not

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
fascinated by these helmets they are not

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.200 
fascinated by these helmets they are not
just<00:02:10.750> looking<00:02:11.750> good<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> outside<00:02:12.260> but

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
just looking good on the outside but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.000 
just looking good on the outside but
they<00:02:14.210> look<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:17.540> universe<00:02:18.020> how<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.590> designs

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
they look in universe how the designs

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.250 
they look in universe how the designs
would<00:02:19.190> look<00:02:19.340> on<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> inside<00:02:20.020> obviously<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
would look on the inside obviously the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.540 
would look on the inside obviously the
actual<00:02:21.410> helmets<00:02:21.830> didn't<00:02:22.010> look<00:02:22.069> like<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:22.370> on

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
actual helmets didn't look like this on

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.350 
actual helmets didn't look like this on
the<00:02:22.610> inside<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:22.970> they<00:02:23.150> were<00:02:23.209> just

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the inside because they were just

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.000 
the inside because they were just
plastic<00:02:23.750> buckets<00:02:24.410> they<00:02:25.190> put<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.459> their<00:02:25.580> hips

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
plastic buckets they put on their hips

into these for a while I've had these
for<00:07:12.370> years<00:07:13.290> but<00:07:14.290> they're<00:07:14.410> really<00:07:14.620> cool

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
than the full-size ones I like I said I

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.430 
than the full-size ones I like I said I
think<00:07:24.610> these<00:07:24.670> were<00:07:24.790> 45-ish<00:07:25.390> this<00:07:26.230> was

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
think these were 45-ish this was

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.470 
think these were 45-ish this was
probably<00:07:26.590> might<00:07:27.520> have<00:07:27.610> been<00:07:27.700> 55<00:07:28.120> because<00:07:28.360> it

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:28.480 
probably might have been 55 because it

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.050 
probably might have been 55 because it
wasn't<00:07:28.750> exclusive<00:07:30.150> but<00:07:31.150> anyway<00:07:32.880> they're<00:07:33.880> cool

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
wasn't exclusive but anyway they're cool
