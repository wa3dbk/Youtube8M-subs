you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.520> set<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.060> cloud<00:01:30.420> printing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you can also set up your cloud printing

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.859 
you can also set up your cloud printing
if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> already<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> cloud<00:01:32.670> printer<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
if you already have a cloud printer you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
if you already have a cloud printer you
can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> devices<00:01:34.890> here

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
can see there's a lot of devices here

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.749 
can see there's a lot of devices here
but<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.329> cloud<00:01:36.900> print

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
but really that's the cloud print

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.980 
but really that's the cloud print
because<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> pretty<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
because I can pretty because I have a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.039 
because I can pretty because I have a
lot<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> devices<00:01:40.380> set<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:42.240> printer

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
lot of devices set up so that printer

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
lot of devices set up so that printer
which<00:01:43.350> happens<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> them<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> set

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
which happens to be one of them is set

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.480 
which happens to be one of them is set
up<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> cloud<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.110> well<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.130> how<00:01:47.430> do

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
up on the cloud as well so now how do

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
up on the cloud as well so now how do
you<00:01:47.610> print<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.350> variety<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.829> ways

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you print well there's a variety of ways

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.780 
you print well there's a variety of ways
eventually<00:01:51.119> developers<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.350> add<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:53.189> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
eventually developers will add in this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 
eventually developers will add in this
option<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> their<00:01:54.630> apps<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:56.340> off<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
option in their apps but right off the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.969 
option in their apps but right off the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
I'm going to actually switch printers

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.860 
I'm going to actually switch printers
because<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.199> have<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> 4x6<00:04:35.180> print<00:04:36.180> paper<00:04:36.389> already

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.490 
installed on the photo smart here and
we'll<00:04:41.370> go<00:04:41.520> ahead<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.789> select<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.720> right

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and we're going to actually have to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.710 
and we're going to actually have to
change<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.180> 4x6<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:56.720> orientation

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
change this to 4x6 and orientation

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.230 
change this to 4x6 and orientation
landscape<00:04:58.229> is<00:04:58.410> fine<00:04:58.680> color<00:04:59.039> now<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.880> photo

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
where Li is in the 4x6 shape but we'll

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.909 
where Li is in the 4x6 shape but we'll
see<00:05:03.240> let<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.050> come<00:05:04.169> out<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.440> print<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:04.770> we'll

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
go ahead and send to the printer so

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.550 
go ahead and send to the printer so
right<00:05:07.710> away<00:05:08.300> it's<00:05:09.300> going<00:05:09.960> ahead<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.349> print

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
can choose cloud print that works fine

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.640 
can choose cloud print that works fine
as<00:05:17.039> well<00:05:17.250> I've<00:05:18.240> done<00:05:18.419> them<00:05:18.570> all<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.410> just

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
as well I've done them all and it just

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.360 
as well I've done them all and it just
works<00:05:19.919> really<00:05:20.400> well<00:05:21.139> of<00:05:22.139> course<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:23.190> know<00:05:23.310> you

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
works really well of course you know you

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.100 
works really well of course you know you
may<00:05:23.550> not<00:05:23.729> find<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:24.090> lot<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.240> opportunity<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.930> do

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
may not find a lot of opportunity to do

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.890 
may not find a lot of opportunity to do
this<00:05:25.260> with<00:05:25.320> your<00:05:25.650> phone<00:05:25.830> or<00:05:26.370> tablet<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:27.120> you

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
this with your phone or tablet but you

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.270 
this with your phone or tablet but you
may<00:05:28.050> find<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:28.560> when<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.889> have<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.130> option

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
may find that when you have the option

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.620 
may find that when you have the option
ready<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.849> go<00:05:31.760> that<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:32.880> may<00:05:33.000> need<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.449> more

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
ready to go that you may need it more

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.820 
ready to go that you may need it more
than<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.979> realize<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.190> did<00:05:35.370> before<00:05:36.830> it

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
than you realize you did before it

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.469 
than you realize you did before it
actually<00:05:37.979> takes<00:05:38.400> longer<00:05:38.520> for<00:05:38.910> these<00:05:39.150> printers

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
actually takes longer for these printers

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.990 
actually takes longer for these printers
to<00:05:39.690> warm<00:05:39.930> up<00:05:40.190> than<00:05:41.190> actually<00:05:41.550> sending<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
to warm up than actually sending the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.830 
to warm up than actually sending the
information<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.770> them<00:05:43.849> so<00:05:44.849> there<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.330> have<00:05:45.419> it

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
information to them so there you have it

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
information to them so there you have it
it's<00:05:46.229> printed<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.990> now<00:05:48.990> this<00:05:49.560> looks<00:05:49.770> like

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
it's printed and now this looks like

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.490 
it's printed and now this looks like
garbage<00:05:50.340> doesn't<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.789> well<00:05:51.500> unfortunately

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
garbage doesn't it well unfortunately

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.610 
garbage doesn't it well unfortunately
