chain followed by the embellishment and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.820 
chain followed by the embellishment and
then<00:02:01.300> closing<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.750> up<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:04.530> before<00:02:05.530> attaching

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
then closing it up and before attaching

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.200 
then closing it up and before attaching
the<00:02:06.040> change<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.460> anklet<00:02:06.790> I'm<00:02:07.030> going<00:02:07.150> to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the change of the anklet I'm going to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.790 
the change of the anklet I'm going to
measure<00:02:07.390> out<00:02:07.660> some<00:02:07.840> suede<00:02:08.110> cord<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.619> going

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
measure out some suede cord that's going

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
measure out some suede cord that's going
to<00:02:08.860> wrap<00:02:09.010> around<00:02:09.040> my<00:02:09.310> ankle<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.730> few<00:02:09.880> times<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
to wrap around my ankle a few times and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.790 
to wrap around my ankle a few times and
then<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> bigger<00:02:14.050> jump<00:02:14.350> ring<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.680> going

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
then with a bigger jump ring I'm going

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
then with a bigger jump ring I'm going
to<00:02:14.860> open<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.760> add<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> chain<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
to open it up and add the chain the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.480 
to open it up and add the chain the
anklet<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.770> suede<00:02:18.040> which<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.340> can

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
anklet and then the suede which you can

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.100 
anklet and then the suede which you can
add<00:02:18.610> after<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> usually<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.810> find<00:02:20.020> it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
add after but I usually just find it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.570 
add after but I usually just find it
easier<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.590> kind<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.830> thread<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> through<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
easier to kind of thread it through the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.860 
easier to kind of thread it through the
jump<00:02:21.790> ring<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.180> close<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.720> now

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
jump ring and then close it up so now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.630 
jump ring and then close it up so now
you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.200> ahead<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.740> put<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.100> on<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.520> can

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you can go ahead and put it on you can

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.030 
you can go ahead and put it on you can
either<00:02:27.790> stop<00:02:28.120> there<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.870> decided<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.860> wanted

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
either stop there or I decided I wanted

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.890 
either stop there or I decided I wanted
to<00:02:30.190> add<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.640> few<00:02:30.910> more<00:02:30.970> chains<00:02:31.390> between<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
to add a few more chains between the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 
to add a few more chains between the
embellishment<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.740> anklet<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
embellishment and the anklet so I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
embellishment and the anklet so I
measured<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.150> another<00:02:34.480> piece<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.750> chain<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
measured up another piece of chain and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.330 
measured up another piece of chain and
cut<00:02:35.530> two<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.860> them<00:02:36.010> one<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.460> each<00:02:36.610> side<00:02:40.170> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
cut two of them one for each side and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.710 
cut two of them one for each side and
then<00:02:42.340> using<00:02:42.580> jump<00:02:42.790> rings<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.210> add<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.510> chain

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
then using jump rings just add the chain

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.210 
then using jump rings just add the chain
like<00:02:43.930> we've<00:02:44.080> been<00:02:44.230> doing<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.710> then<00:02:44.890> attaching

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
like we've been doing and then attaching

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.950 
like we've been doing and then attaching
it<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> embellishment<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.780> kind

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
it to the embellishment and this is kind

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.600 
it to the embellishment and this is kind
of<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.080> an<00:02:47.200> afterthought<00:02:47.710> so<00:02:47.920> typically<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
of like an afterthought so typically the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.070 
of like an afterthought so typically the
embellishment<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.360> one<00:02:49.630> jump<00:02:49.900> ring

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
embellishment can have one jump ring

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.870 
embellishment can have one jump ring
that<00:02:50.230> holds<00:02:50.380> all<00:02:50.620> three<00:02:50.950> chains<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.730> can

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
that holds all three chains but you can

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.970 
that holds all three chains but you can
do<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.060> however<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.170> I'm<00:02:53.830> just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
do it however you like and I'm just

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.500 
do it however you like and I'm just
going<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.190> do<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> other<00:02:54.430> side<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.330> my

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
going to do the other side with it on my

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.820 
going to do the other side with it on my
foot<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:55.989> see<00:02:56.140> exactly<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:56.739> I'm

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
foot so you can see exactly what I'm

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.530 
foot so you can see exactly what I'm
doing<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> also<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.120> can't<00:02:58.300> find<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
doing and also if you can't find a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.699 
doing and also if you can't find a
bracelet<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.050> will<00:02:59.170> work<00:02:59.350> around<00:02:59.500> your

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
bracelet that will work around your

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.260 
bracelet that will work around your
ankle<00:03:00.040> go<00:03:00.489> ahead<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.820> just<00:03:00.910> make<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:01.239> own

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
ankle go ahead and just make your own

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.090 
ankle go ahead and just make your own
with<00:03:01.630> beads<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.930> charms<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.440> stuff<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.890> just

with beads and charms and stuff and just

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.680 
with beads and charms and stuff and just
make<00:03:03.250> sure<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.520> on<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.670> stretchy<00:03:04.150> string<00:03:04.480> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
make sure it's on a stretchy string and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.050 
make sure it's on a stretchy string and
also<00:03:05.680> last<00:03:05.890> thing<00:03:06.160> during<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.580> tutorial<00:03:06.970> you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
also last thing during this tutorial you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.150 
also last thing during this tutorial you
can<00:03:07.209> cut<00:03:07.390> double<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.989> every<00:03:08.320> pc<00:03:08.680> measure<00:03:08.890> so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
can cut double of every pc measure so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.590 
can cut double of every pc measure so
the<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.550> make<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.880> other<00:03:10.150> foot<00:03:10.450> is

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
the one you make for the other foot is

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.030 
the one you make for the other foot is
identical<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.410> don't<00:03:11.560> want<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.770> leave<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
identical so we don't want to leave that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.590 
identical so we don't want to leave that
one<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.430> chilling<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.030> naked<00:03:13.390> while<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
one just chilling and naked while the
