00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.499
 m 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.079
 so it takes its doors if places these Roma live why because 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.130
 mean for him 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.340
 literature this is episode 6 6 million euros the secret of a 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.449
 unknown 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 so I'm already going to start with the phases of game platforms 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.069
 the film having put this crisis 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.579
 she was pavement 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.589
 a strong field a lot of chances 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.950
 pikine especially that a bomb 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.970
 at this level of unemployed and for bcp mixed sites 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.340
 fuckin 'but what's going on there + or role 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 french rum 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.060
 so here's the third cubes and after the last phase go 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 not bad in its kind cinema 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 so do not skip 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.310
 if they wish they are all his films 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 that is why 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.580
 but no need to jump while France I think be ready when 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 same conclusion 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 there is chirac do not miss but then not at all 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 otherwise the timing is open and youtube 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270
 Keita 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.450
 I do not know how many movies 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 a little serious 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.040
 now at home 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.210
 how 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.200
 access to the premises 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.340
 three hours earlier to do this because 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 it is complicated 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.259
 millions of layers 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.679
 so the first excerpt 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 you have to wait for the grotto behind the mill 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.909
 a good knowing that contact with m 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.909
 in question but not the time of the city 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 he should this year again 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.059
 and yet the cave 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:55.789
 we are going to pass 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 behind me 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 it hurts 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.749
 and their maintenance 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.219
 here to unlock the turbo healthy goal 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.439
 which will serve for later
