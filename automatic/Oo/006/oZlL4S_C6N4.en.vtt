00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.790
 how about friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.490
 show how to make a lamp with 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.879
 liquor bottles of those that nothing else 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.110
 they are abandoned with our houses or 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.180
 rooms you like a lot 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.340
 save this type of bottles because 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.580
 this favorite good well here you 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 I will show how to make a lamp with 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.740
 favorite stars 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.130
 the material that we are going to need is 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.950
 but 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 of the size of what is the basis of a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.670
 little boy what it is the basis of the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.750
 bottle or whether the layer works very 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.990
 either one of the two 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.030
 ah 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.010
 we will be 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.829
 the color that you like either blue 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.909
 red i chose it red 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.909
 red bottle because 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:06.550
 hence the indispensable with tweezers was 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.120
 choose cable all these things with team 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.940
 for food we can use already 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.430
 be batteries as in the video that they 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.040
 I will leave in the description 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.050
 to make batteries 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:26.650
 fed 120 laps per 220 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:31.150
 depending on the area where they live 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.750
 ok we have this that is 12 volts to 2 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.750
 amps 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.320
 but good in this case I'm going to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 use this 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.530
 can work them from what is 9 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:53.770
 volts up to 14 laps more or less than 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.439
 it does not work correctly 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 because what I 'm going to do is cut a 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.860
 little of 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 from this led strip 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.910
 so that it is in the part of 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.910
 inside what is the lid or the cuplÃ© 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.050
 it does not matter if we exceed between more 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.710
 light 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.710
 is better 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.620
 in this case they did not use any 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.630
 switch because because it's easily 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.210
 I can connect and disconnect in 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.860
 box no 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.860
 do not need your lighting 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.130
 now at the bottom I will make a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.040
 small hole with either the same 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.280
 tip of the tau teams is hot naughty 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.500
 or with a bit a thin bit nothing 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.500
 more so that the cables go through 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.060
 p 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.430
 and from there 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.430
 since we have that ready 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.060
 we take off the band and proceed to 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.060
 paste 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.270
 inside what are our leds 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.270
 in this way 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.610
 since we have everything ready we will not have 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.610
 in this way 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.930
 I on the outside decided to put a little bit of 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.930
 tape 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.980
 and the top a little like 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.050
 of tape so that it does not slip 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.350
 what is the bottle when putting it in the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.350
 base 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.770
 let's do a little test 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.550
 12 volts 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.020
 and ready 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.490
 It is a beautiful lamp was very good 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.490
 for a little light 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.289
 and ready is simple 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.289
 easy to do 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.550
 it looks great if you like it 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.100
 collect this type of bottles 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.930
 Here is an idea of how to show them 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.020
 put them on display 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.770
 but you liked forget to subscribe 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.940
 give you like share it with your friends and 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.500
 in the next 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.160
 do not forget to check the other videos that 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.160
 they are in the description
