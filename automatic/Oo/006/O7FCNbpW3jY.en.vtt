00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
experience of gardening that when you

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.050 
experience of gardening that when you
plant<00:03:51.989> further<00:03:52.409> apart<00:03:52.859> your<00:03:53.280> pets<00:03:53.609> grow

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
plant further apart your pets grow

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.289 
plant further apart your pets grow
bigger<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.599> stronger<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.470> even<00:03:56.040> more<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
bigger and stronger and even more so it

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.659 
bigger and stronger and even more so it
is<00:03:57.510> more<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:58.260> area<00:03:58.650> we're<00:03:59.010> only<00:03:59.190> going<00:03:59.489> to
