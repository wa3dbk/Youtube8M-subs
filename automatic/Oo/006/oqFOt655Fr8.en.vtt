00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
bit more pulling power from what I've

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bit more pulling power from what I've
tested<00:01:09.340> then<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.150> aristokraft<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.520> has<00:01:12.700> the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
tested then the aristokraft it has the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
tested then the aristokraft it has the
articulated<00:01:13.450> truck<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.259> can<00:01:14.380> take

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
articulated truck so that it can take

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.640 
articulated truck so that it can take
eight-foot<00:01:15.670> diameter<00:01:15.850> corners<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:17.380> doesn't

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
eight-foot diameter corners it doesn't

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.590 
eight-foot diameter corners it doesn't
have<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.800> flared<00:01:18.100> radiator<00:01:18.580> like<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.119> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
have a flared radiator like the the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.580 
have a flared radiator like the the
aristocraft<00:01:20.080> does<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:22.360> has<00:01:22.509> LEDs<00:01:23.110> front<00:01:23.470> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
aristocraft does it has LEDs front and

back<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.580> has<00:01:24.700> alternating<00:01:25.210> ditch<00:01:25.360> lights

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
back and it has alternating ditch lights

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.450 
back and it has alternating ditch lights
at<00:01:26.020> slow<00:01:26.289> speed<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:28.030> turn<00:01:28.240> down<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
at slow speed and you turn down the the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.510 
at slow speed and you turn down the the
power<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:31.030> detects<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.600> slower<00:01:32.229> speed

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.149 

get<00:01:40.509> it<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:40.869> it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.399 

yeah<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.149> ditch<00:01:46.450> lights<00:01:46.689> alternate<00:01:47.229> it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
yeah so the ditch lights alternate it

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.389 
yeah so the ditch lights alternate it
has<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.860> think<00:01:47.979> more<00:01:48.430> detail<00:01:48.820> than<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
has I think more detail than the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.270 
has I think more detail than the
aristocrats<00:01:51.490> SD<00:01:52.210> 45<00:01:52.659> or<00:01:53.020> SD<00:01:53.409> we're<00:01:54.009> sorry

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
about - 9 the smoke unit also puts out

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.490 
about - 9 the smoke unit also puts out
quite<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.820> bit<00:01:57.970> more<00:01:58.090> smoke<00:01:58.420> than<00:01:58.720> the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
quite a bit more smoke than the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.850 
quite a bit more smoke than the
aristokraft<00:02:00.100> unit<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:02.020> detail<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.409> the

trucks and the lettering there's a lot

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.540 
trucks and the lettering there's a lot
more<00:02:07.080> than<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> aristocraft<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
more than the aristocraft I like the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.009 
more than the aristocraft I like the
controls<00:02:12.910> better<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> aristocrat<00:02:13.840> that

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
controls better on the aristocrat that

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.449 
controls better on the aristocrat that

built in all the control units whereas

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
built in all the control units whereas
the<00:02:21.430> USA<00:02:21.760> train<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.299> has<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:23.110> underneath<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
the USA train one has it underneath that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.339 
the USA train one has it underneath that
little<00:02:24.130> harder<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.430> access<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.750> both<00:02:28.959> great

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
little harder to access but both great

nines<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.380> they<00:02:32.470> pull<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.950> lock<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.250> pull

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
nines and they pull a lock that pull

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.979 
nines and they pull a lock that pull
more<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.060> cars<00:02:34.299> than<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.660> own<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:37.269> sd70

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
more of the cars than I own and the sd70

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.309 
more of the cars than I own and the sd70
pulls<00:02:38.260> even<00:02:39.190> better<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:41.140> the

pulls even better I like the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.350 
pulls even better I like the

better than the USA trains you don't

nine and put in their system and it

nine and put in their system and it
works<00:02:52.390> great<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.709> far<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:53.920> detail<00:02:54.340> pulling

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
works great but as far as detail pulling

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.990 
works great but as far as detail pulling
power<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.840> sd70<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.940> probably<00:02:57.940> a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
power the the sd70 is probably a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.849 
power the the sd70 is probably a
superior<00:02:58.510> locomotive<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.590> has<00:02:59.680> better

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
superior locomotive and it has better

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.199 
superior locomotive and it has better
track<00:03:00.160> pickup<00:03:00.489> because<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.790> has<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> dual

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
track pickup because it has the dual

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.800 
track pickup because it has the dual
pickup<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.900> has<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:03.359> sliders<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.690> has

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
pickup it has the sliders and it has

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.900 
pickup it has the sliders and it has
wheel<00:03:05.019> picked<00:03:05.290> up<00:03:05.410> -<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.950> power<00:03:06.100> pickups<00:03:06.850> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
wheel picked up - so the power pickups a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.610 
wheel picked up - so the power pickups a
lot<00:03:07.060> better<00:03:07.209> than<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.480> cab<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.720> tell<00:03:08.109> it's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
lot better than the cab you tell it's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
lot better than the cab you tell it's
better<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:10.030> overall<00:03:10.450> my<00:03:10.840> opinion<00:03:11.139> a<00:03:11.230> better

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
better I'm overall my opinion a better
